<td>What is the difference between shareholder and stakeholder ?</td>
<td>The shareholder possesses a part of something, while the stakeholder has an interest (in the non-financial sense of the term) in something.

The stakeholders of an organization could be its shareholders, employees, vendors, customers, communities where it operates etc.

I have seen this term more and more used in the context of sustainable development: what matters is not just the wealth of the shareholders, owning money is now only one of several goals that also include having positive environmental and social impacts.

As usual, Wikipedia has an excellent definition.</td>

<td>What is a stable and high return investment?</td>
<td>Hi,

Consider investing broad index funds which are quite safe, and would have return in 10% range over period of 5-10 years. Consider funds like VTI, VXF, SPY and there are many others, you can research on finance.yahoo.com.

<td>Can someone *simply* explain what a stock "short" is?</td>
<td>Shorting a stock (or selling short) ideally works like this:

When you think a stock is going to go down...
1. You borrow shares of stock you don't own, typically from your broker.
2. You sell those shares at today's price.
3. You wait for the stock to go down.
4. You buy the same number of shares back at a lower price.
5. You return the borrowed shares.
6. You pocket the difference between the buying and selling price.
Steps 1 &amp; 5 are actually done automatically when you issue a short sale order with a broker.

The advantage of shorting is that you can make money when stocks are going down.  (With a normal stock purchases, you only make money if the stock goes up.)

The disadvantage is that in theory, you could lose an unlimited amount of money.  For example, if the stock goes up to five times its original value, you've just lost four times your investment.  (With a regular stock purchase, the most you can lose is the amount you originally invested.)</td>

<td>what is and why stock buyback? is it the same as repurchase? is it a good news to the market?</td>
<td>A stock buy back is when a company buys back some of it's own stocks. For example, stock A has 100,000 shares outstanding and has a net income of 100,000 dollars, (1 dollar per share) and the company buys back 10,000, not only will the stock go up, because stock prices go up when there is an increased demand for a buy, and now they would have 90,000 shares outstanding so each share now makes $1.11 per share. The negative part, is that this company would have less cash, and their stock equity drops, makes them less valuable in the books. Large companies or cash stable companies have buy back policies.</td>

I have an account there for my savings and the rates are a lot higher than Bank of America, Washington Mutual, Wells Fargo, etc...

<td>What is the difference between a savings account and a money market account?</td>

They are completely liquid (you can make withdraws whenever). I highly recommend opening a money market account simply because you earn 2% or 3% more than a savings account. They also adjust to the current interest rate much faster than savings accounts which typically move like molasses on a winter day.</td>

<td>best way to invest money...risks doesnt matter for me?</td>
<td>It's been mathematically "proven" that you can get high returns AND reduce your risk by buying diverse high-risk investments which have no correllation.

Also, Equities (Stocks) have had some of the best returns historically, and are still considered a very good investment.

Of course you don't want to be STUPID about it and buy the riskiest stuff possible.  Get some AGGRESSIVE mutual funds with low fees (Vanguard has some).  Spread your money around to highly aggressive funds that have little correllation.  For instance, some Domestic High Growth, some Foreign aggressive growth, maybe some Real Estate Trust Funds, some High Tech, Some Health Care.

Look at the historic returns of the sector and the fund.  Look too at the risk vs. return.  If, as you say, risks don't matter, then go for high return funds, with a reasonable risk.  And spread it around - but make sure you spread it around to different TYPES of investments - all that are aggressive, but some that move contrary to each other (like foreign vs domestic, or REITs vs Stock)</td>

<td>What will happen to GM?</td>
<td>Big question. GM is not a candidate for bankrupcy quite yet.They have been trying to raise money by selling some of their assets and reducing their fixed expenses, but it does not addresss the fundamental management/marketing issue which is that they seem to lose money every time they sell a car, and have not been able to come up with a desirable product line. It is a sad case of a corporation that has been so complacent for so long, that they don't seem to even realize how to capitalize on their strength, which is greatly improved quality (see JD Power research). I would think that they have to shrink considerably, sell (or even give away) non profitable brands such as Saab, and end up with maybe just two car lines, one popular that would combine Pontiac and Chevrolet, and a luxury division such as Cadillac, and a truck line. I do not buy the argument that is being floated by GM that "there is no money in the car business". In the past ten years alone, Hyundai, Kia, Chrysler, and Nissan have come back from the dead, and Toyota is building hundreds of thousands of vehicles in North America, profitably. Why not GM? Why is management not given the boot?</td>

<td>What do you save for first - home or retirement?</td>
<td>You can serve both purposes at the same time.  If you dont plan to buy a house for atleast five years, invest in a Roth IRA.  You can contribute up to $4,000 in 2006 amd 2007.  Starting in 2008 you can contribute up to $5,000 per year.  You also have until April 15 of any year to contribute money for the previous year.  First time home buyers can take up to $10,000 (lifetime limit) out of a Roth tax and penalty free, as long as you have had the IRA for atleast 5 years.  You can also take out your own contributions to a Roth IRA tax and penalty free at any time.  If you take money from a 401k plan to buy a house, you either have to take a loan from the plan, which you have to pay back or else it becomes taxable as well as pay a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty.  Or you have to qualify for a Hardship Distribution,  which you have to pay the 10 percent early withdrawal penalty on.  If you take the money from a Roth there are no strings attached, other than the $10,000 lifetime limit, and the 5-year rule.  So, theoretically if you start a Roth in 2006, in 5 years you could take out $33,000 (your contributions from 2006-2010 plus $10,000) free of any taxes and penalties.  And if you make a contribution before April 15 2006. for the 2005 tax year, you can meet the 5 year rule in less than 5 years.</td>

generally, you should start with the highest interest rate you have, for example if you have a lot of credit card debt (can be up to 25%!!) pay that first, then pay your student loans, then once you're debt free, start saving.

if you had a lower interest rate, say 3%, then it might have been a good idea to invest, since you can easily find money market accounts or cd's that will guarantee a rate of return that's higher than what you owe, making it more profitable to keep the money and remain in debt than to pay it off.</td>

If you expect to move potentially move out from your current residence to a new country, then it may make sense to build up an asset base in the new country you are going to, just to make the transition easier for you and to allow you to time the conversions to your benefit.

If you don't plan to leave your current country, then the only reason is a short-term diversification for the purpose of investment gain. For example, if you expect the Euro to appreciate over the next few months, then you could convert some $ to Euros,  and then if it does appreciate, convert them back to get more $. However, note that currency fluctuations are highly affected by local interest rates which somewhat counter the possible gains you can get in this way.</td>

<td>Power of Compounding?</td>
<td>The performance measures of portfolios (sharpe &amp; treynor) are all determined as comparisons against the tax-free rate of return generated by 30-day treasuries which has the least market risk.  Any %age point of return higher than this rate of return typically comes with additional risk.  The more risk, the higher the return.  

If you look at the Ibbottson return studies, you'll see that in order to garner an AFTER-TAX return of 10% you'll need to put the risk of small-cap stocks heavily into your portfolio mix over a long period of time, otherwise 10% is quite difficult to attain.

Rules are great and assumption return rates are also great -- as long as you can actually achieve those returns.

The best way to achieve this type of return is to look to get a mixture of capital gains plus dividends into your portfolio return mix -- this way you're not reliant on the market shooting up 10% to get that return.  An appreciation of 6% with dividends of 4% would do the trick for you, this is typically a more established company, not a 'small cap' company.</td>

Stock picking the best stock is not an easy task, it involves hardwork to be the best, same for picking the best stock too. 

To ensure that you jump in on the right time, and not suffer huge losses, is important that you learn the basics of investment and select the style of investing you prefer. Cause I can tell you a good stock now, but if you enter at the wrong time, you might get burned, and you will suffer.

<td>Are you single or married?  For a single person the current income limit is $95,000 for a full contribution and then there is a reduction until you reach $109,999 where you are no longer able to contribute.  Check with your tax accountant to see what your reduced contribution would be.

If you are self-employed go with a SEP.  Otherwise max out your employer's 401k and then buy mutual funds outside of a retirement account and I Bonds.

UPDATE: Then you would qualify for the max contribution this year.  If you believe your income will be higher next year, make sure to talk to your tax adviser.  You don't want to contribute to a Roth if you don't qualify.</td>

If you are really into CDs, it is good to have CD laddering. Here is a good advice from http://www.bankrate.com/brm/savings-advi... 

"With CD laddering, you buy a number of CDs for different terms. For example, if you have $10,000 to invest and need access to $2000 every year, you buy 5 $2000 CDs, with terms of one, two, three, four and five years. When your 1-year CD matures, you roll it over into a 5-year CD, and so on. This way, you get most of your money in higher-yielding CDs, but every year one CD matures, so you have access to part of your investment."</td>

<td>What should I include in the "exit strategy" section of a business plan?</td>
<td>Well a good approach is to posit several possible scenarios for how you business may end via acquisition.  Which players are interested in the technologies you have built?  What would be the value of your work to them?  What alternatives do they have to acquiring your technology?

By working through these scenarios, you'll already get a good sense of the scale of an acquisition based exit.  Now this is all assuming the value of your technology on its own merit, outside of how much business infrastructure you have built around it.

To evaluate that element properly, you need to examine the basic financials of your business.  Are you profitable?  Is there significant revenue?  Is there significant debt?  If the business has been running for a bit and generates profit with modest operational cost, then you can probably get a buyer based purely on this fact.  You should expect to get anywhere from 2-20 times the value of yearly revenue, depending on the operational quality if your business.

Anyhow, your exit strategy needs to include these basic financial numbers, or your projections of them for the future window where the acquisition might happen, and then it should lay out the attractiveness of an acquisition for the potential technology buyers.  If you do this, you would have done your due dilligence, and the finance guys can take it from there.</td>

<td>Start with Ten Mil and invest it in the stock market.

With some luck, you'll earn $1 mil (which is what I THINK you meant to ask).

If you lose 90%, you'll still have $1 mil.

------------

Seriously, as one who has done what you are looking to do, with the success levels you are talking about, I have to say that the BEST way to make a lot of money is to start your own business.  Look at it this way, if you work for someone else, you can pretty accurately predict what your salary will be over 5 years (even optimistically)- and it will probably be no where near $1 mil.

So, Here's the plan.

1. Start your own business.  You should do something you LIKE to do.

2. Set a target for who you are marketing to, and what product or service you are providing.  Define that well, on paper.  Perhaps you want to provide computer programming services for accounting firms, or provide financial planning services for wealthy men (&gt;$2M net worth) in their 40's.  Whatever.  Define it well.  This sets your target customer.  It guides your efforts.

3. Every SPARE moment goes toward building a business for your target... finding customers in that arena, building a product or service offering in that target range.

4. Set a financial goal.  If you want to earn (gross) $1M in 5 yrs, maybe it looks like this:  Yr 1: 25K, Yr 2: 70K, Yr 3: 130K, Yr 4: 260K, Yr 5: 520K.  That would put you over 1M for the total, and with a growth rate that would put you over $1M in yr 6 as well.

5.  PUT A PLAN ON PAPER.  What does yr 2 look like?  Who are you selling to, and what are you selling?  How many customers do you need?  How many employees do you need?  What does a budget look like?  (where would you be spending your money in year 2, to insure that year 3 produces the results that you need).  It's a GIVEN that your plan will be WRONG (one way or another), but it's CRITICAL that you do this ON PAPER.

6. Read The E-Myth.  Michael Gerber lays out a roadmap.  (That was a guide for our multi-million dollar start-up)

7. Hire people ONLY IF YOU MUST, and then HIRE PEOPLE SMARTER THAN YOU.  This is critical.  Most start-ups go "on the cheap".  Most start-ups fail.  Look for people that have succeeded in starting a business.

8. Put your business plan into a "presentation", and present it to as MANY influential people as possible.  Amazingly MOST EVERYONE is supportive of the little guy who has the guts to go out on a limb.  Listen to their advice (and weigh it accordingly).  This is part "strategic planning" and part "marketing".  You are just trying to get the message out.  At the end of each presentation, ask "do you know of anyone who I should talk to, who would be interested in my product or service?"  Get leads.  Follow up on them.

9. Keeping your eye on your target market and financial goals, turn down VERY LITTLE business down (initially) until you can meet your financial target.  Price your deals based on how close to the target they are.  For instance, if you choose to perform Landscaping for businesses, but someone asks you to help them with a residential job, bid the job so that it's "worth your time".  Don't ever complain that "this isn't my core business".  The only business you want to avoid in the early stages are the deals that don't have a clean exit or a paying customer.  If you can state your price, and do a job, and have a satisfied customer, and make a few bucks, that is golden!  You are looking for reference accounts.

10.  When you are so busy that you have the luxury of being selective of the business that you take on, price yourself accordingly.  Some business you may want to say no to.  Other business you may want to price high.  Remember the TARGET set in Step 2.  If it's a "bullseye" deal (exactly the type of business you are looking for, with a customer that will be happy and refer</td>

<td>Is now a good time to buy gold and where?</td>
<td>Gold is at all time highs right now. It's impossible to know if it will go higher or fall back down. If you are looking to add a little bit of gold into your porfolio (&lt; 5%) to diversify, sure why not. People will say not to buy at all time highs, but personaly, I'd rather buy at an all time high than an all time low. When gold hit $400 last year...everyone was saying it was too high. Look where it's at now.

A good analogy is stocks. Take Cisco of the 1990s...as it was skyrocketing, every day was practically a new all-time high. If you never bought for that reason you would have missed out on a huge gain. Of course you can't compare Cisco with Gold but it was just to make a point.

There are several ways to buying gold. You can invest in the gold mining companies i.e. NEM, AU, ABX, PDG. or you can invest in Gold Trust fund like GLD. GLD trades at 1/10 the actual value of an oz of GOLD. http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GLD

<td>Will gold go up significantly more, or will it tank?</td>
<td>If you don't have a magic eight ball, it's impossible to predict the future direction of gold, or any other market for that matter.  Having said that, I'll have a go...

As you know, gold has enjoyed a strong bull run over several years and has recently by climbing more and more rapidly.  Most analysts would say that this leaves it open to a correction, i.e. at some point it has to come down.  I believe that when gold starts to fall, it will fall faster than it has risen.  At the first sign of selling, everyone will be desperate to lock in their profits (i.e. sell) and there will be few buyers.  Indeed, this week, we started to see signs of what might happen:
http://news.ft.com/cms/s/9a0be6b4-6ea1-11da-9544-0000779e2340.html

Couple this with the long term intentions of central banks to reduce their gold holdings, as well as some people's belief that gold always enjoys a strong spell in the run up to Christmas, and I don't believe the yellow metal will do well once 2006 starts.  I could be proved completely wrong, however.

In summary:
1. Gold could go up more.
2. Gold is more likely to come crashing down.
3. The question should be when will gold tank.  Good luck with that one!</td>

<td>The Department of Commerce's Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) has taken important steps to remove unnecessary obstacles to exporting, including completion of U.S. regulatory reform effort and export control liberalizations. Working closely with the exporting community, BXA has simplified the EAR, especially for those companies new to exporting. In addition, export controls have been liberalized on many products sold by U.S. companies around the world, consistent with national security and foreign policy concerns.

A relatively small percentage of exports and reexports requires the submission of a license application to BXA. License requirements are dependent upon an item's technical characteristics, the destination, the end use, and the end user. Determining whether a license is required for export is easier under the newly drafted regulations which consolidate license requirements previously scattered throughout the regulations. Once a classification has been determined, exporters may use a single chart to determine if licenses are needed for a country. The revised regulations include answers to frequently asked questions, detailed step-by-step instructions for finding out if a transaction is subject to the regulations, how to request a commodity classification or advisory opinion, and how to apply for a license.</td>

This stock sucks! It's at a 5 year low and is has been sliding since year 2000. Investors Business Daily rates this stock a 15/100, letter grade E (lowest grade). Earnings per share is rated at a 2 out of 100. It's relative strength is rated at a 1 out of 100..which means it's part of the bottom 1% of all stocks.

The stock dropped over 4% today on higher volume. 2,636,800 shares traded today..that is more than 3x the normal volume for this stock. That means people are dumping.

Your money is better spent elsewhere. If you buy..it's more of a gamble, not an investment. You can gamble that some huge news will come out and the stock will go up a few pennies or even a dime, which is 5-25%. Nothing like that has happened the last 5 years...doubt it will anytime soon.

<td>Is Variable Life Insurance a good investment vechicle?</td>
<td>VUL is not worth it.  Life insurance is not meant to be an investment tool.  Though, often cash value is the enticing aspect in the eyes of the consumer, insurance should be bought for protection.  VUL is often outperformed by Universal Life and basic Whole Life because of the higher administration costs, lack of investment options, and bad market performance.

The admin costs for VUL are more costly because every time someone touches a piece of paper in the insurance business there's a charge associated with it (ie, paying quarterly is more costly than paying annually because of the admin costs of receiving 3 more payments).  With VUL there is much more paper being processed, and more parties involved.

You have more options for investment within IRA's, or general investment accounts, so why not purchase insurance for insurance and investments for investments.  Too often, VUL policies lapse due to underfunding caused by bad performance or an agent's inflated illustration (ie, 10-14% returns), thus leaving the individual without coverage and needing to repurchase insurance at a higher rate due to their increased age.

Isn't the purpose of buying insurance to eliminate risk?  VUL just adds a new form of risk into the equation.  If the lower price is the incentive, go with UL.  If you can afford it, go with Whole life.  It is the grandfather of the life insurance business and more money comes out of pocket, but the stability, guaranteed return and peace of mind is worth it.</td>

I´ve tried alot of different ways to make money online over the past "painful" 2 years and theres alot of crap out there that just doesn´t work, it´s amazing how they can keep getting awy with it! Now after soooo many disappointments I´m using Data Entry Pro and it´s now making me money (finally!) online.

Anyway, basically you sign up with them and then once your logged in you just fill in as many forms as you like in their members section and you get paid for each one. I get checks from them every 2 weeks each averaging around $250-$350. You could make more but I just use the site as an extra income stream aswell as my full time job so I only work on it for around an hour each night.

You do have to be prepared to spend a little money though if you want to do anything online like this but it´s already been worth it for me.

<td>what is mortgage?</td>
<td>MORTGAGE - The transfer of title to real estate which is made to secure the performance of some act such as payment of money by the person making the transfer. Upon the performance of the act, the grantee agrees to convey the property back to the person who has conveyed it to him.

Mortgages are of several kinds: as they concern the kind of property, mortgaged, they are mortgages of lands, tenements, and, hereditaments, or of goods and chattels; as they affect the title of the thing mortgaged, they are legal and equitable.

In equity all kinds of property; real or personal, which are capable of an absolute sale, may be the subject of a mortgage; rights in remainder and reversion, franchises, and choses in action, may, therefore, be mortgaged; But a mere possibility or expectancy, as that of an heir, cannot.

A legal mortgage of lands may be described to be a conveyance of lands, by a debtor to his creditor, as a pledge and security for the repayment of a sum of money borrowed, or performance of a covenant with a proviso, that such conveyance shall be void on payment of the money and interest on a certain day, or the performance of such covenant by the time appointed, by which the conveyance of the land becomes absolute at law, yet the, mortgagor has an equity of redemption, that is, a right in equity on the performance of the agreement within a reasonable time, to call for a re-conveyance of the land.

It is an universal rule in equity that once a mortgage, always a mortgage -- every attempt, therefore, to defeat the equity of redemption, must fail.

As to the form, such a mortgage must be in writing, when it is intended to convey the legal title. It is either in one single deed which contains the whole contract - and which is the usual form - or, it is two separate instruments, the one containing an absolute conveyance, and the other a defeasance. But it may be observed in general, that whatever clauses or covenants there are in a conveyance, though they seem to import an absolute disposition or conditional purchase, yet if, upon the whole, it appears to have been the intention of the parties that such conveyance should be a mortgage only, or pass an estate redeemable, a court of equity will always so construe it. 

As the money borrowed on mortgage is seldom paid on the day appointed, mortgages have now become entirely subject to the court of chancery, where it is an established rule that the mortgagee holds the estate merely as a pledge or security for the repayment of his money; therefore a mortgage is considered in equity as personal estate.

The mortgagor is held to be the real owner of the land, the debt being considered the principal, and the land the accessory; whenever the debt is discharged, the interest of the mortgagee in the lands determines of course, and he is looked on in equity as a trustee for the mortgagor. 

An equitable mortgage of lands is one where the mortgagor does not convey regularly the land, but does some act by which he manifests his determination to bind the same for the security of a debt he owes. An agreement in writing to transfer an estate as a security for the repayment of a sum of money borrowed, or even a deposit of title deeds, and a verbal agreement, will have the same effect of creating an equitable mortgage.

A mortgage of goods is distinguishable from a mere pawn. By a grant or conveyance of goods in gage or mortgage, the whole legal title passes conditionally to the mortgagee, and if not redeemed at the time stipulated, the title becomes absolute at law, though equity will interfere to compel a redemption. But, in a pledge, a special property only passes to the pledgee, the general property remaining in the pledger. There have been some cases of mortgages of chattels, which have been held valid without any actual possession in the mortgagee; but they stand upon very peculiar grounds and may be deemed exceptions to the general rule.

<td>What does the word" peg" mean in stock reports?</td>
<td>PEG refers to the P/E ratio (price divided earnings per share) divided by the projected earnings growth rate of the company.
Example:  A company has a stock price of $10, earnings per share of $0.50 and a project earnings growth of 30%.  It's P/E ratio would be 20 (10/.5) and the PEG ratio would be 0.66 (20/30).
Now imagine that the company had a projected earnings growth rate of 5%.  The resulting PEG ratio  would be 4.0 (20/5).
Investors often use the benchmarks of 1.0 or 1.5 as an indicator of a stock's valuation (expensive v. cheap).  I would argue that 1.0 is for low-growth companies and 1.5 for high-growth companies.  But, you can make your own judgements.
Basically the PEG ratio allows investors to compare the price they're paying in relation to future earnings growth across different stocks.  All else being equal, you want to buy a stock with a lower PEG ratio because it means you're paying less for the same future earnings power.  But of course, all other things are not equal when comparing different companies, so you must consider all other relevant factors when making a decision.</td>

<td>What's a cheap and easy way to buy stock in a company I think is going to do very well?</td>
<td>equiserve.com manages direct stock purchase plans for hundreds of companies. Perhaps the one you are thinking of is listed there. The transaction fees buying direct is a lot cheaper than paying the $7/trade through Scottrade or $10-17 for etrade.
I know Exxon charges no fees when you buy direct through them (equiserve.com manages their purchase program)

To find out if the company you are interested has a direct stock purchase plan, go to the company's website and click on the "investors" links...and see if they have any information. 

If the company doesn't offer direct purchase, your next cheapest way is to go through a discount broker  like scottrade,etrade,waterhouse. You can also look at sharebuilder.com if you want to buy the stock monthly at a set amount. It can be as cheap as $1/transaction every month if you put money in 20 different stocks..normal fees are $4/trade via their monthly plan.

Keep an eye on the stock and watch for company news. Investors Business Daily recommends cutting your loss if the stock drops 7-8% from your buy point. This is to protect you from the possibility the stock drops even more. Also keep an eye on the daily and weekly volume in the stock. There is support in the stock if it goes up and the volume is above average. The opposite is also true...a down day with high volume or volume 2-5x higher than normal may indicate institutional investors are dumping.

When you put money in a 401k, you have experts putting it into mutual funds for you.  They take alot from you.  So, theoretically, you can buy your own stocks and make a heck of a lot more.  And instead of investing in them for 45 years, you can invest for 8 years and make the same amount or more.  This is true, however, you dont know what to invest in.  So, I suggest you start small and on something a bit more safe.  I will show you 2 or 3 of the best ways to do this.  I am a rare coin expert.  These ways are not fool proof because the economy goes up and down in a cycle of booms and busts.  But, they do cut out the risk because you only have 10 years left.  
The first method is through gold.  I suggest you buy the physical form and not stocks or anything of that nature.  You can buy the physical form and allow the sellers to store it for you.  Do not allow them to store it for you if they are just a small company.  I would rather take the physical gold with me.  There is a fee to take this gold with you though.  But, its better then not having it.  With gold, its always hovering at about $278 to about $315.  I would say that anything less then $290 is a good buy.  When you buy, they always tack on an additional couple of dollars because the gold was assayed into a gold bar for you.  When gold is high, they add like $4.  When it is low, they might add $7 dollars.  Dont worry about this.  Just pay for it.  I would rather buy bullion coins then the gold bars in the packages.  They cost $10 dollars above the gold value in the bar form.  Now, there are certain gold bullion coins that you should and shouldnt buy.  Its always best to go for the pure gold ones.  The reason being is, sometimes a jewelry store will take it in, but they will only pay for its content because they were going to melt it anyways.  And if it wasnt pure 24k, then they might have to take a couple dollars off to turn it into 18k or 14k, etc etc.  So, the purest ones are the Canadian gold coins, and the Chinese gold coins.  When gold goes down, you buy, when they go up, you sell.  Its that simple.  You cant lose because gold goes up and down all the time.  So, dont sell if you lose.  Just keep it there.  Whats the point of saving if you are going to dip into it?  So, over the course of 10 years, I know you can make a sizeable profit.  The question is large or small because you will not know when to buy and sell.  All you see is a profit when you sell, and you see a cheap price when you buy.  What you do is buy when its around $290 or less.  Sell, when it goes up.  And with the excess, you can buy more gold.  Just continue doing this.  I know for a fact that you can start off with $3000 dollars today and make at least 20 trades in the next 10 years and make no less then 100% of your investment back.  Gold is currently at $500 plus.  What if you bought it when it was $290 or less, which is what is preferred.  Thats over 200 per ounce.  So, in a year or two, do you see that you would have had over 5k?  You just have to wait till it goes down to around the 300 mark.  I mean, even if you buy for 290, and it goes up to 310 in 2 weeks, you can still sell and make 300 dollars.  That would add almost another ounce to your portfolio.  Continue to do this until you are about to retire.  During the last year, you will be waiting for the highest price you can find to sell.  Another thing to look into is instead of gold coins, you can buy grain gold.  They are just little balls of pure gold.  They are usually a couple dollars cheaper, but they are hard to obtain sometimes.  
Second way of investing is buying coins from the US mint.  They will be the cheapest price you pa</td>

<td>I believe that there are inefficencies that can be exploited.  I also think that there are trends and over-reaction that can be exploited.  It's not perfect, but I believe that you CAN do a little better than the indexes, but it takes a little more risk and a lot of effort.

For me, the effort isn't worth it.  I don't want to spend 8 hours a day fiddling with my investments.  So in general, I like the indexed funds.

On the other hand, occasionally I'll look for one of those opportunities where I can take advantage of an over-reaction in the market - where a stock is TOO beaten down or TOO hyped, and try to take advantage of it.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  But I do just enough of it to be interesting and fun.

I liken it to driving along the highway in rush hour.  You pick a lane.  And then every once in a while you try to switch lanes to improve your position.  Sometimes you pick right, sometimes you pick wrong.  But in general, you CAN improve your position if you try (because there are enough people on the highway who are just coasting, NOT trying to improve their position).

But the highway (stock market) is A LOT better way to improve your position than the city streets (CD's, individual real estate properties).

The best investment, though, is probably to do what most self-made millionaires have done, and start your own business.</td>

<td>How do you know if a website is safe to buy from?</td>
<td>That is certainly a danger.  Fraud is a serious problem and Internet crime is one of the fastest growing crimes out there.

Even if you do recognize the name of the company, they could be "phishing" which simply means using a domain name that resembles that of the company but is different from the real one via:  a common misspelling, an extra/missing hypen in the domain name, etc.

Moreover, crooks like to trick you by making your status bar show something else than the actual URL when you hover over the link, and then change it in the address bar upon your arrival.  Yes, they can do that, unfortunately.  Web browsers seem to have been created by people who think that people do not lie, cheat, or steal - or that such people do not use the web.

That being said, there are a few things you can do.

Look at online consumer opinions sites.  One example is the epinions.com web site and there are probably others now too.

You can go to your library, and see if the company has a Dunn &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) entry.  Go to reference section or microfilm/computer area of your local library to check this out. If you get stuck, ask a librarian or someone at the reference desk for help.

If you click on the order or the registration page, they should go into SSL mode.  At that point, any decent browser will let you check the credentials of the site.  Usually they call it the site certificate or something like that.  Look for that.  If they don't use SSL - hoo boy, do you really want to use their site even if they _are_ who they say they are?

You want to make sure the cert is good -  not expired, and that it is signed by someone you trust, like Verisign.  It's not an iron-clad garranty they are who they say they are, but it is something.  At least they have claimed it, and the claim has probably not been revoked - not if the cert is still valid and signed by a good/respectable CA.  I am presuming that if they scam a bunch of people and are using SSL, someone will gripe to Verisign or whomever.

You can minimize your risks, if you are unsure, by buying their merchandise from someone you already trust and do business with online.  For instance, Amazon.  They have been around for a decade and carry a huge variety of products.

Also, you can use payment intermediaries with some sites.  Like, I just now notice that Apple's iTMS web site says at this moment that if you buy an iTunes gift certificate with PayPal, you get up to 25 Free Songs.  PayPal is pretty popular.  Lots though not most web sites accept payment via Paypal. In some ways, maybe most ways, it is more secure than your credit card.  That is that the worst you can probably be out is the amount of the purchase.  They don't ever actually get to see your credit card when you use PayPal, I think.

It is a somewhat unstrustworthy world out there.  In some countries/cultures and neighborhoods, it is deemed perfectly acceptable to rip somebody off.  It is a big status symbol thing.  Obviously, law enforcement is lax/lacking in these areas.

Credit card fraud is a huge problem, costing billions of dollars per year.  Be safe, protect yours.</td>

<td>Why is mutual fund VEXPX down 7.35%  today?</td>
<td>The fund paid out a distribution- if you own this fund you will have received $6.44 in dividend income. When this happens the stock or mutual fund that pays the dividend is said to have gone "ex-dividend". Since the fund has paid out cash to shareholders, the NAV or unit price will also be reduced by that amount. The fund actually gained $0.44 today based on it's investment results- the stated NAV change was -$6.00 but $6.44 of that was due to the dividend.

This type of event typically happens once a year for mutual funds. They typically have to distibute some of their gains for tax purposes.

<td>1.  401(k) is like a scooter.  You're company that you work for provides you this savings plan. The company selects who administrates the savings account (where you park your car) which investments you can have (which road you can drive your scooter on), and they can match your contributions (like mom &amp; dad giving you gas money).  If you want to get that money (selling your car), you need to work with the "Fund Administrator", and sometimes your "Human Resources/Supervisors" to get that money.  Sometimes, you'll only get the money if you promise to pay it back.  ( yep, mom &amp; dad want you to be responsable )

2.  IRA is like a standard car. You can select who administrates the account (or where you park your car), what investment to buy (what roads to drive on).  Unfortunantly, there is no one available to give you a match on your contribution (no gas money from mom &amp; dad); but you can deduct your contribution from your taxes.  You can also withdrawl the money at anytime (selling your car). . . BEWARE. . . there are financial concequences to this. . .research before you choose to withdrawl (its like sales tax from selling your car. . .if you sell at the wrong time, you'll get jipped on the sale proceeds).

3.  A Roth IRA is like a hybrid car.  You get to pick who administers the account (parking the car) which investments (which roads to drive), but there is no matching and you can't deduct your yearly contributions from you taxes.  Instead, you can get your money without tax conseques (selling your car) when you need it. . .BEWARE. . . to get your money without tax problems, there are still rules.  Research before you withdrawl funds (sell that car). Providing you withdrawl (sell that car) under the guidlines, you don't have to pay sales tax on the withdrawl ( no sales tax from selling the car).</td>

All of the complex transactions happen pretty much automatically and behind-the-scenes, from the point of view of the typical stock-holder. You might wake up one morning and check your portfolio and find that your 100 shares of Company A have been converted into 1000 (or 10 or 23) shares of Company B. The dollar value will still be the same as it was the day before (assuming you looked at the price after the market closed and then got out of bed and checked again before it re-opened).

<td>What professional licenses and business permits are required to start a hedge fund?</td>
<td>It actually depends on what field your hedge fund will be investing in. A hedge fund is a partnership or LLC that takes capital from investors and invests in assets. Those assets can range from securities to real estate to debt. I'll answer the question assuming that you will be dealing strictly with securities.

The SEC recently came out with a ruling that requires any hedge fund with greater than $25MM in assets to register as a Registered Investment Advisor and a hedge fund with the SEC. Other than that, you will need to register the Hedge Fund as an LLC and yourself as the corporation that is the managing partner of the hedge fund. It is best to do this in the state of Delaware. 

Your prime broker will be able to assist you with any registrations necessary for actual exchanges.</td>

Be weary though, there are a bunch of crap companies out there that will just rip you off, but I have had personal experiance with a couple of top notch companies and have seen it happen.

<td>Where can I learn about using puts and calls?</td>
<td>Puts and calls are examples of options in the stock and bond market. 

In the special language of options, contracts fall into two categories - Calls and Puts. A Call represents the right of the holder to buy stock. A Put represents the right of the holder to sell stock. 

Call Options
A Call option is a contract that gives the buyer the right to buy 100 shares of an underlying stock at a predetermined price (the strike price) for a preset period of time. The seller of a Call option is obligated to sell the underlying security if the Call buyer exercises his or her option to buy on or before the option expiration date. For example, an American-style WXYZ Corporation May 60 Call entitles the buyer to purchase 100 shares of WXYZ Corporation common stock at $60 per share at any time prior to the option's expiration date in May.

Put Options
A Put option is a contract that gives the buyer the right to sell 100 shares of an underlying stock at a predetermined price for a preset time period. The seller of a Put option is obligated to buy the underlying security if the Put buyer exercises his or her option to sell on or before the option expiration date. Likewise, an American-style WXYZ Corporation. May 60 Put entitles the buyer to sell 100 shares of WXYZ Corp. common stock at $60 per share at any time prior to the option's expiration date in May.

The Expiration Process
At any given time, an option can be bought or sold with one of four expiration dates. This is indicated by a month and year description. The expiration date is the last day an option exists. For listed stock options, this is the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month. Please note that this is the deadline by which brokerage firms must submit exercise notices. You should ask your firm to explain its exercise procedures including any deadline the firm may have for exercise instructions on the last trading day before expiration. 

Exercising the Option
Options traders don’t actually have to buy or sell the underlying shares that are associated with their options. They can and often do simply opt to resell their options - or "trade out of their options positions". If they do choose to purchase or sell the underlying shares represented by their options, this is Called exercising the option.

2) Long term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.
Warren Buffett is considered to be one of the greatest investors of all time and he employs a buy and hold strategy.  
You should view the stock market as a place to "invest" your money in good companies and not a place where you "gamble" by trying to play the short term ups and downs that are nearly impossible to predict (unless you have illegal inside info).
If you trade often, taxes and commissions will really start to eat into your returns.  Short term capital gains are taxed at a higher rate than long term capital gains.
Do your own research and buy for the long term and you will come out ahead.</td>

if you want to make money, then we have to identify a portfolio that outperforms the market.

if this is to be the PERFECT portfolio then 2 things apply:

1. the assets in it will change continully almost on daily bases - based on the latest news &amp; performance of the best assets
2. the proportions in which the assets are held in will change continuelly with respect to market conditions and fundamentals (e.g. 100% stocks in boom, 100% fixed income in recessions. Actually, why not go short in a bear market? - jesse livermore made $100million decades ago by going all out against market. he ofcourse crashed the whole stock market.

anyways, if there was such a thing as a 'perfect' portfolio, i would be making money and wouldn't tell you. ofcours there are those who think they know, and they can't wait to tell you (see links in the other answer). 

anyways, you should always think about risk - if ur young go with a more risky portfolio, if ur old, then 100% fixed income is definately the PERFECT portfolio for u! gluck


for me, the perfect portfolio should be as follows:

55% stocks
&gt; of which, 1/3 (20% of the total) in different industries 
&gt;&gt; of which 50% in top-cap, 30%midcap, 20% small.

Thus there should also be a large number of shares (the float) that can be freely traded and are not tied up by insiders for example.  Lastly the options must be made available on a stock exchange and brokers must be willing to trade them for their clients.

<td>how do companies earn when the rates of their shares go up? who else is benefitted ?</td>
<td>A company does not benefit directly by appreciation in its stock price. A company's stock represents ownership interest in the company. Stock holders (e.g. individual investors, mutual funds, etc) own the stock of a company and therefore benefit when the stock price rises, because now they can sell the stock for a higher price than before.

A company can indirectly benefit from stock price appreciation. When company A acquires another company B, the purchase price is usually paid in cash or company A's stock. So if company A's stock price is higher, then it could afford to pay more or buy more using its stock. Another benefit is employee moral. Many companies offer employees stock options, stock grants, or employee stock purchase plans to encourage employee ownership of company stock. So when the company stock price rises, the employees' investment is worth more.</td>

Before making any financial choice like this, you must first think about your own risk/return profile and what your investment goals are. If you're young and have time to risk money now, you may be better off investing in a riskier fund. If you're closer to retirement and need money to fall back on, you may look toward more conservative funds. Also, look into index funds and spiders (which mirror market indices such as the S&amp;P 500).</td>

More in-depth definitions follow:

Any type of financial instrument that is used to make payments between countries is considered foreign exchange. The list of instruments includes electronic transactions, paper currency, checks, and signed, written orders called bills of exchange. Large-scale currency trading, with minimums of $1 million, is also considered foreign exchange and can be handled as spot price transactions, forward contract transactions, or swap contracts. ...
http://www.pathtoinvesting.org/dictionary/words_f.htm

Forex is short for foreign exchange. When one speaks of a forex profit or loss, he is talking about the increased or decreased value of an investment caused solely by currency movements. For example, if an investor thought that the dollar was weak, he might purchase German money markets. The investor's account might earn 3% annualized, but the real profit or loss could be in how the DM (German mark) moves against the US$ (United States dollar). ...

<td>How can you derive the rule of 72 from the compound interest formula?</td>
<td>Derivation

For periodic compounding future value is given by

    FV = PV &amp;#92;cdot (1+r)^t,

where PV is the present value, t is the number of time periods, and r stands for the discount rate per time period.

Now, suppose that the money has doubled, then FV = 2 PV. Substituting this in the above formula and cancelling the factor PV on both side yields

    &amp;#92; 2 = (1+r)^t

This equation is easily solved for t:

    t = &amp;#92;frac{&amp;#92;ln 2}{&amp;#92;ln(1+r)}

If r is small, then ln(1+r) approximately equals r (this is the first term in the Taylor series). Together with the approximation ln 2 ≈ 0.693147, this gives

    t = &amp;#92;frac{0.693147}{r}</td>

<td>Whats the best stock?</td>
<td>What is the best stock is a question subject to great uncertainty. In other words, it is sort of like betting on a horse prior to a horse race. Certain companies sell at higher price to earnings ratios than others. These are the 2-1 bets.  Other stocks have low price to earnings ratios. These are the 20-1 long shots. The market at any time tends to price each stock in relation to its earnings potential, its dividend, and other factors.  If the market were 100% efficient, then all stocks would be equally good. There is a good deal of rational for this reasoning. One rational is that the vast majority of mutual funds-75%--tend to underperform the average stock. Some of their underperformance is due to their expenses. Some is due to the fact that no matter what they buy, it will tend not to perform any bettern than the market in general. 

As a result many mutual funds and exchange traded funds have come to market that try to match the market in general. In other words they have thrown in the towel in trying to pick the best stocks.  

But!!!  Mutual funds have to invest a LOT of money billions of dollars.  With that much money to invest they have a problem.  They just can not find a good stock and dump a billion dollars into it.  

Since you do not have a billion to invest (my assumption based on the fact that if you did you would not be asking this question here) you may be able to beat the market.  Some do and some do not. 

I have no idea what the best stock is? I doubt that whoever you asked would have any idea. 

Here are a couple of suggestions though.

Do you think that more easy oil will be discovered? If the answer is no, you might consider an oil stock. Another advantage of owning an oil stock is that when the price at the pump goes up 25 cents you won't feel so bad. 

Do you think that we are at the top of a housing bubble similar to the internet bubble?  If the answer is yes, you may want to avoid the stock market all together and put you dinero into T-bills. 

Do you think that there will be more and more old people? If the answer is yes, you may want to buy some health care stock.</td>

If it is all of it, you can try buying some long term deep in the money Dec 07 call options on the S&amp;P 500 (SPY).  Most likely the stock market will go up over that long period of time, and you can leverage your investment capital.  However, we have had stock crashes in our history, and if one just happens to occur come Dec 07, you could stand to lose money, perhaps all of it.  If it happens in the middle, you still have time to recover.

Otherwise, you might check out Series I inflation protected savings bonds put out by the Treasury department.  They are current paying over 6%, and if inflation continues on a rampant pace (high fuel prices continue), then high yields may continue.  If you cash it out in 5 years, then you will not have to pay any interest penalty.  You are also guaranteed not to lose your principal.</td>

I use a valuation method that uses EPS, although most people recommend using free cash flow as a more accurate measure of a company's financial strength. Basically I try to estimate what a stock will be worth in the future, and what price I would need to buy it at now to ensure a certain rate of return.

Harshad Shantilal Mehta was born in a Gujarati jain family of modest means. His father was a small businessman. His early childhood was spent in the industrial city of Bombay. Due to indifferent health of Harshad’s father in the humid environs of Bombay, the family shifted their residence in the mid-1960s to Raipur, then in Madhya Pradesh and currently the capital of Chattisgarh state.

In April 1992, the Indian stock market crashed, and Harshad Mehta, the person who was all along considered as the architect of the bull run was blamed for the crash. It transpired that he had manipulated the Indian banking systems to siphon off the funds from the banking system and used the liquidity to build large positions in a select group of stocks. When the scam broke out, he was called upon by the banks and the financial institutions to return the funds, which in turn set into motion a chain reaction, necessitating liquidating and exiting from the positions which he had built in various stocks. The panic reaction ensued, and the stock market reacted and crashed within days.</td>

<td>link between inflation stocks bonds and treasury bills?</td>
<td>well,

1. if stocks go up, bonds(t-bills,t-noteS,t-bondS) will go down. why? - because stocks give a higher return than bonds.

2. if stocks go down? bonds go up. why? because bonds are fixed-income assets meaning the return on them is fixed. so if stocks are coming down, bonds will go up as investors switch to bonds to have a safer rate of return.

3. if inflation goes up? bonds come down. why? because bonds give a fixed rate of return on the fed rate. lets say 5%. if inflation rises from 1% to 2%, ur REAL rate of return declines by 1%. but u can buy inflation-adjusted bonds!

4. inflation vs stocks? difficult. inflation broadly defind is rising prices - which can raise nominal income - which can increase expectations and raise stock prices. inflation is also a sign of a strong, somewhat booming economy, so stocks should be rising. too much inflation, persisted over longer time can damage stocks. to grasp a better understanding of this relationship see the definition of inflation. it effects the economy in many ways. but it surely damages bonds which have already been issues.</td>

<td>Are online paidsurveys real? or scam? do you really get paid ? is it worth investing your money for membership</td>
<td>Hi Tiger,

I never really had much luck with the online surveys thing. I´ve tried alot of different ways to make money online over the past "painful" 2 years and theres alot of crap out there that just doesn´t work, it´s amazing how they can keep getting awy with it! Now after soooo many disappointments I´m using Data Entry Pro and it´s now making me money (finally!) online. 

Anyway, basically you sign up with them and then once your logged in you just fill in as many forms as you like in their members section and you get paid for each one. I get checks from them every 2 weeks each averaging around $250-$350. You could make more but I just use the site as an extra income stream aswell as my full time job so I only work on it for around an hour each night. 

You do have to be prepared to spend a little money though if you want to do anything online like this but it´s already been worth it for me.

Here`s the link you can get them at anyway -&gt; www.protry.com 

Hope this helps!
Goodluck,
Dave</td>

<td>how do i open an offshore account say like in switzerland without having a huge amount to deposit ?</td>
<td>Even if you can find a financial institution that will accept a small deposit, you will have additional financial costs to open and maintain the account. If you are speaking of Swiss banks, the fees, opening costs, and maintenance costs are extremely high, and every Swiss bank I have heard of requires a high opening deposit. Also, Swiss banks are no longer safe or anonymous, as in many legal cases Swiss banks have quite willingly cooperated to send their customer's financial data to foreign governments requesting it.

By comparison, banks in other foreign places such as the Bahamas are more secure and offer more services for the money that you spend, such as providing a trust or incorporation of a corporation for you. However, here the starting cost to do this is approximately $10,000.

You may want to look into anonymous cash systems. However, these systems are generally not true banks, but are merely systems to hold money.</td>

<td>What's the best gold stock to buy in 2006?</td>
<td>I really don't have a recommendation for a specific gold stock, but would like to point out that a gold mining company stock can actually significantly outperform GLD. It is the same for any natural resource company because they all have the potential to take their current assets and create huge amounts of new wealth by making discoveries of new resources. A small gold mining company with $1 million in assets might make a discovery that makes them into a $1 billion company in only a few months based on the work they do to explore their mining leases. When you buy a gold mining company, you are buying something much different than just buying gold. This can work both ways, as I once held a mutual fund of gold mining stocks that did poorly while gold rose from $330 to $430 an ounce. That said, I know of no good way to evaluate the future potential of gold mining companies, but with good research and due diligence, you might find the ones that will outperform gold prices.</td>

<td>What is the most valuable currency in the world now (2005)?</td>
<td>If it's investing rather than trading, then something with low volatility arguably has more value, in which case the Swiss franc is hard to beat.  It is seen as a safe haven in turbulent times so tends to strengthen if other countries experience disasters or terrorist attacks, for example.

As for direct correlation, I would say this is not possible simply because there are so many factors to a nations economy.  For example, the USA's trade deficit has been increasing recently which should put downward pressure on the dollar, but the dollar has not fallen as some were expecting it to.  Other internal and external influences have been supporting it.

In other words, a country's economic situation affects its currency but there is no direct correlation because there is no single measure of an economy's status.  In addition, other countries and even individuals can have a controlling influence over a nations economy, regardless of its economic health.

And correcting the post above, the yen is Japan's currency.  China has the yuan.</td>

There are many ways you can market your advice on the internet. If you have a budget to work with, you can pay for search engine placement, use email marketing, or place banner ads on related websites. If you do not have a budget to work with, here are some options:
1. Set up a Blog - some websites will let you do this for free. In the blog you can give out advice and link to your website.
2. Email marketing - many companies will give you a free trial to test out a campaign, but you would have to pay a monthly fee based on the subscribers you have. These start at $15.95/month.
3. Establish yourself as an expert by joining a forum related to your topic. If allowed, be sure to link back to your website or blog. 
4. Send out a news release to online publications with interesting information that their website visitors could use.
5. Start your own Podcast. I am just learning about this myself, but from what I've researched so far it maybe effective for what you are doing and it does not cost anything to get one started.

These are just a few things you can do to market advice on the internet. I hope this helps.

Sometimes you have to know when to let your beloved stocks go. Look at the 5 year graph for Intel, and you can see that there are obviously better places for your money, but because the stock had done so well up to that point, alot of people couldn't find it in themselves to sell. On the flip side, emotions can be involved in buying, too. One always has to be careful in the choices they make. My advice, before any decision you make, prepare a 60 second "speech" detailing why you have made that decision. If you have a hard time figuring out why you want to make the decision, it's probably emotion.</td>

<td>If i am living at poverty level, what are my best option for savings and investment?</td>
<td>You're obviously a smart person, thinking about the future.  My recommendation is to use those smarts to work into a position that is well above the poverty level.

There are two obvious ways to increase your savings rate:  Increase your income and cut expenses.  You should probably look toward doing both of those things.

Regarding increasing your income, consider the following options:  Get a better job, get a second job, ask for more money from your current employer, or invest your time to acquire skills that will allow you to get a better job.

Look out a year.  What can you do NOW, so that you can make dramatically more money in a year?  Go to school?  Self-educate on the Internet?   YES, that is possible!  Get a job that has the possibility of more rapid advancement?  Sure!


Regarding cutting your expenses, one major trick is to eliminate interest payments by paying off your debt.  Make a list of all your debts, and organize them in order by interest rate, highest to lowest.  Usually Credit Card debt is top of the list.  Your goal is to reduce your TOTAL debt as fast as you can, but also replace high-interest debt with lower interest debt.   You may be able to do this by paying off credit cards faster than you pay off secured debt (like your car).

A few other obvious places to cut:
-  Don't do anything like Payday loans.  Those are typically outrageous rates.  Better to temporarily borrow from savings than borrow from a loan shark.

-  Look at how much you spend on basic "living", and consider what the BARE MINIMUM is.  For instance, are you buying soda or starbucks?  Are you going out to eat?  What's the cheapest you could live on, and try it for a month.  

-   ANYTHING that you have that is a luxury needs to be eliminated, until you get a savings plan in place.  Cable TV?  Cancel it.  Cell phone AND a land line?  Cancel one.  Dish?  Come on!  High Speed Internet?  Use a free service for a while.  

-  Eliminate ALL fees from your life.  Are you PAYING for your checking account?  Paying to use an ATM?  Paying late fees on credit cards?  Each dollar here and dollar there adds up.  You should strive for ZERO fees.


Once you can afford to save, consider some FUND investing.  The stock market can be a great place to watch your money grow;  it can also wipe out a lot of money.  If you buy into a fund, you can often reduce your risk, since mutual funds buy lots of stocks.  

Don't forget to set aside money in a 401-K.  MANY employers will MATCH some of your contribution.  This is like FREE MONEY.  I am always amazed at the number of people who pass this up.

If you get a few thousand together, consider opening a brokerage account with Schwab or a mutual fund company.  Many mutual funds will accept a few thousand dollars, and open an account, and then you can benefit from the gains in the stock market.  You can research on the web for the "best" funds (Morningstar rates them; listings can probably be found in Fortune magazine, Schwab.com, and others.)  You probably want a reasonably aggressive fund which allows you withdraw whenever you want.




Best of Luck to you!  Hope I have been of some help.</td>

when you own a stock, you own a share of that company, and thus you own a portion of those profits. this is known as EPS, or earnings per share. so if the company earns more, your share of those earnings is worth more. conversely, if a company makes less, then the shares are worth less.

however the relationship is a bit more complicated in practice. what makes the market frustrating yet beautiful at the same time is that human emotion is involved. you have analysts and ceo's making predictions as to how much the company will earn. often these predictions are overblown, so if the company does well, but not quite as well as the liberal predictions, then you have a lot of people overreacting to the news and perhaps selling the stock, driving its price down. this is often a great time to buy, because there are no fundamental problems with the company, and yet there is an artificial depression in the price. after a few weeks or months, people will forget about the predictions and see that the company is healthy and going strong, and the price will rise to a normal level again.

you also have situations when earnings will be very high, even outdoing expectations, but the company will issue a negative future outlook, so investors will get scared and sell, even though the earnings for that quarter or year were great.

also as you noted, sometimes investors will sell after a long run-up, taking their profits. this causes a small drop in share price. this can also be seen as a natural market correction to a stock price that has gone up faster than a company's performance, and falls back into line.

then there are completely unrelated situations like 9/11, the war in iraq, hurricane katrina, etc, that may have little or no direct impact on the company and its earnings, but drive the market lower or higher. look at how market prices reacted after 9/11 (huge drop). or after the US went to war in iraq (steady rise).

over the long run, I would argue that markets are efficient, meaning that if a company is profitable and does well, the stock price will rise, and if it does poorly, the stock will will fall.

over the short term, prices are impacted by the things I noted above, as well as others, that have little to do with a company's long-term performance. these irregularities in price should be seen as possible buy opportunities, if you feel the stock has become undervalued. it is these inefficiencies in the market that allow an intelligent investor to reap big profits.</td>

Diversify is a verb which means to spread your income among various investments, usually to protect yourself if one of your investments goes bad.  In the above example, this is a mix of different investments so you may say that the above person has already diversified.

If a person had 50% of their income in home equity and 50% in microsoft stock, a financial planner might tell them to diversify more so that they don't get killed in a housing crash or if Microsoft stock plummets like Enron's did.</td>

<td>Should I invest my capital in stocks, bonds or mutual funds?</td>
<td>One thing to consider is your timeline. Are you looking at some quick profits or are you looking to invest the $1k and be ok if the market goes up and down.

Stocks will provide you the biggest gain..however, it is also the riskiest. If you choose to invest it in stocks...pick one stock and put the $1k into it. You don't want to own $200 worth of 5 different stocks. Just keep in mind that it will fluctuate on a daily basis. Pick a high quality stock. GE has always been one of my favorites. It is almost like a mutual fund because they are so diverse within the company. They pay a 2.8% dividend which isn't bad. The stock doesn't move much but it's stable.

Mutual funds are a lot more stable than an individual stock. They tend to move slow because it's usually very diversed and invested in 50+ different stocks. If you choose a mutual fund, I'd pick something like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund. It tracks the entire stock market.

Bonds- not as exciting as stocks or mutual funds. But super stable. If you are ok with the returns and not a big risk taker..this is the one you want.

I have a friend who is scared of losing even a penny in the market and puts all his money in CDs!! But everyone is different when it comes to how much they are willing to lose.</td>

I also look to see if the company is buying back it's own stock.  This indicates that they have looked at the market and have decided there are no companies they wish to purchase or do not or can not expand their products or services.  Also if the coampany pays a consistant dividend it usually means it is fairly stable.  With dividends being taxed at a lower rate now (15%), the dividend can mean a stable company.  Again I try to find companies that are in a down cycle but are stable.  Others will choose companies that are up and coming in an industry.  The major problems with them is they are usually cash poor and if there is a major downturn in the market or their industry, they may not have the cash reserves to weather the storm...</td>

What influences the gold price?:

A constant issue in the gold market is what influences the price.   Most people logically believe the supply and demand figures in the physical gold market will determine the price.

However, the futures market in New York is the single largest place in the world where more gold contracts are traded than any other.  The price at which the physical gold changes hands, in almost all cases, depends on the price at the New York exchange.  Practically all gold bullion and gold coin dealers will base the price of their transactions on this price.

Therefore, the supply and demand at the NY exchange is probably the single most important factor (at least in the short term) in determining the outlook for the gold price.  We can see large changes in the supply or demand in the physical market, but if the price does not first change at the exchange it is not likely to change the price of the physical gold.

Of course, in the longer term, supply and demand in the physical market will cause the futures market to change accordingly, but significant and sustained changes in the physical gold market are few and far between.</td>

Fee structure

The important thing to remember is to allocate your assets in a manner in line with your time horizon and risk tolerance and DON'T CHASE PERFORMANCE. This years winners are not usually on the top of the heap next year.

It is never a bad idea to consult a financial planner, either.</td>

<td>what exactly is a stock in a company? how is it determined how much a share is? and how many shares?</td>
<td>This is the answer to your 2nd question. Do you remeber supply and demand? I will illistrate by comparing a company's stock to a city. If there are more people moving away from a city do to a STORM than there are moving to the city, what would happen to the value of the houses in this particular city? Since more sellers are selling than there are buyers buying, the sellers will have to lower the price to compete with each other. This would be a buyers market. THe buyer has the upper hand. 

Now, picture the STORM I mentiond, instead of the storm being a hurricane and the city being a city, the storm is now a newspaper article entitled, "Intel Misses Wall Streets Expectations 
buy a penny," and the city is now a society of people who own stock in Intel. 

Let's say you and I own a pizza shop we invented, Atari's Pizza. We have 5 tables and two grills for a total of 800 square ft. However we get very busy @ night, we'll do $20,000 in sales a night. We ask ourselves one night after work, "imagine if every city in the country had an Atari's pizza"

In order to make that happen, you will need $$$$$. In order to get the $$$$, you will offer the world a small stake in Atari's and decide to sell 2million shares for 20$ a share. THis is called an IPO (initial public offering), so to answer part of your question, you (Atari's) set the initial price, hence, "initial offering."  

Ok now the offering is over and you have 2million times 20$. Let's say that much money is enough to get you twenty stores up and running right away. Now how many stores will you have in 20 years? If each store gives you 20k a night, this is a lot of money. It will be enough to add 5 new Atari's every year in different towns. 

THink about it now, you sold 2 million shares to the public for twenty bucks and that was enough to get 20 new stores up and running right away. Also it was enough to sustain 5 new stores a year.

Now for the arithmetic,  20 stores (Stock Price 20$)+ 5 new stores a year for twenty years =  120 stores

Hypothetically, the price of the stock would be @ $120 because if investors were willing to pay 20 dallors when Atari's only had 20 stores then they would pay 40 dallors when Atari's had 40 stores as long as Atari's rate of growth didn't change, all else equal in other words.

This also sets the price or stockholders equity. What if Pizza Hut wanted to buy Atari's. They would be buying from the stock holders not the original two owners. That supports why 120$ a share is sufficient for 120 stores. That is what Ataris' is worth.

Good Luck I hope this helped

It's fun because it allows you to compete just with your friends and the site will tell you if you are beating the S&amp;P500 or not.

CHeck out investors.com if you want good info on how to buy the right stocks at the right time. Open an online discount brokerage account like scottrade.com . Trades are only $7. That way you won't have to pay the $50+ the big brokers charge.

With good research and a bit of luck you can triple your $1000. I did that with Apple. I bought it at $17.

<td>when will the iraqi dinar gain in value?</td>
<td>In about 20 years when the country is finally able to start producing more oil than they are consuming. The value of the dinar is also dependent on many other things, like the actions of the Central Bank of Iraq. At present it has essentially a fixed value of 1477 dinars to the dollar. This value is being held fixed because all of the contractors working in Iraq need a stable exchange rate in order to operate. The value has not fluctuated by more than 1% since the exchange began operating a couple of years ago. 

The Iraqi dinar probably has as much potential to lose value when it is finally traded on the open market as it does to rise. The Iraq economy will be oil-export dependent and at present Iraq is not producing as much oil as it was before the war. In fact much of the oil Iraq is presently exporting is being offset by imports of refined products like diesel and gasoline. Because oil production cannot be increased under the present unstable conditions, it may be decades before Iraq becomes a significant oil exporter. Many of the wells in Iraq were permanently damaged by being shut down for the war. These wells will have to be redrilled or repaired and at present this is almost impossible. An oil rig makes a very vulnerable target and no oil company is going to risk its workers and assets on something that will become a target for bombers and snipers. It often takes years of planning to prepare for drilling an oil well, and then can take months or years to develop a new discovery. It could easily be 5 or 10 years before Iraq sees new oil production even it it starts tomorrow, and it won't. 

If you bought dinars I suggest you frame them and hang them on the wall. That may be their best use, since you can't redeem them at any bank outside of Iraq.

<td>How do you convert an annual compound return to an annual total return?</td>
<td>Hmm...not sure if this question is answerable.  Not sure where the term "annual total return" comes from.  Annual compound return is really only useful if you're talking about periods over more than a year.  Assuming that you mean to compare "total % return" and annual compound rate, you can use:

Total % Return = (1 + (Annual % Rate))^(Years)

Assume a 5% annual compound return, then after 10 years you would have

(1 + .05)^10 = 1.62

You would have 162% of what you started with, so if you started with $1, you would have $1.62.</td>

Sometimes the way to make the most money is simply to avoid loosing money. 
The global economy is more fragile than than we are led to believe. 
I suggest a conservative, diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, cash, timber REITS, and precious metals. (You can invest in precious metals through an exchange traded fund like CEF or GLD.)
Series I savings bonds are an excellent choice if you are investing taxable money, as you don't have to pay taxes on them until you redeem them.

Stocks assign portions of a company ownership to any person in the public. This ownership entitles them toreceive any profits as well as rights in voting in the board of directors.

The thing is, with share trading/stock trading nowadays, there are advanced techniques to trade shares using leverage - which means traders don't need to put up the whole amount to have a piece of the price action. All they need is to put down a collateral and pay interest payments. This is called CFDs - which are outlawed in USA but used in other countries.

However an alternative to this, which is available in US are stock options - which allow you the right to buy or sell a stock. you can trade these to profit along stock price movements.</td>

<td>What are the best places for me to invest my money into (and how much?)?</td>
<td>That depends so much on how old you are and if you have any other money on hand for emergencies etc.  Maybe you could give more of those details.

OK, now we have your age and amount:

You will probably be needing this money to pay for college in about 3 years.  If so, you would not want to put it in the stock market.  You should put it in something safer (e.g. a 3-year CD, or perhaps I-Bonds).  You should also consider having your parents put the money into a 529 plan for your college.  This depends somewhat on how you came by the money (did you earn it, could it be treated as your parents money, etc.).

If you don't need it for college, and you know you can leave it for 10+ years you should open an account with someone like Vanguard and put it in a no-load stock market index fund.  I don't know if you can open an IRA at your age, you could check into that as well.</td>

<td>A bond, in a nutshell, is a loan you make the a corporation or government (for example a War Bond).  They are purchased through brokers, but some organizations, such as the government, allow people to buy them directly.  When you loan money to the organization, they keep it for a set period of time to improve their business (or in the government's case, buy war machines, repair schools and so on).  That means that during this time, you don't have the money to spend on yourself.  To pay you back for the lost opportunities, your opportunity cost, the organization pays you back with interest at the end of the bond (some bonds pay interest during the life too, but thats too complicated for a quick answer). You do gain money on interest, but depending on your investment style and risk aversion, it may or may not be enough to cover your opportunity cost.  If you are interested in buying government bonds, contact a government office (ususally the post office can point you in the right direction.

<td>What is a Charitable Trust? How does it work? Can u put stocks in it?</td>
<td>A Charitable trust can take several forms. The most common is the Charitable Remainder Trust. The grantor transfers ownership of assets (yes they can be stocks) to the trust. The assets are used to generate an income paid out to the grantor by the terms of the trust. When the grantor dies the remainder of the trust assets pass to the charity named as the beneficiary of the trust. This type of trust is very useful if an individual has highly appreciated stocks and needs to draw an income from them.

If you just sold the stocks you would pay capital gains tax on the gain. By transferring the stock to the trust, you actually get a tax deduction on the value of the stock transferred. The trust can sell the stock without incurring taxes and reinvest the money in income producing investments to generate the income to be paid out to the grantor.

I´ve tried alot of different ways to make money online over the past "painful" 2 years and theres alot of crap out there that just doesn´t work, it´s amazing how they can keep getting awy with it! Now after soooo many disappointments I´m using Data Entry Pro and it´s now making me money (finally!) online. 

Anyway, basically you sign up with them and then once your logged in you just fill in as many forms as you like in their members section and you get paid for each one. I get checks from them every 2 weeks each averaging around $250-$350. You could make more but I just use the site as an extra income stream aswell as my full time job so I only work on it for around an hour each night. 

You do have to be prepared to spend a little money though if you want to do anything online like this but it´s already been worth it for me.

Here`s the link you can get them at anyway -&gt; www.protry.com 

Hope this helps!

It's not perfect, so some times there are places to find undervalued stocks and create a win.  But remember that there are people that do nothing more than look for paterns and build software packages to leverage those patterns for large funds.  That being the case, any advantages that can be found are quickly milked from the marketplace in a hurry.  Think of it this way, if there were significant advantages to using this software then the market would quickly migrate to that method of trading until the cost of such would outweigh the bennefit.

In order for you to buy shares on the stock market, you must have a broker or a dealer.Publicly-owned corporations does not transact with individual private persons for security reasons but only to licensed stockbrokers.

What's involved? If you really want to experience how it is to transact business in the stock market, you can try logging into your area's stock market website. There are some sites which supports this kind of "dummy" buying and selling of stocks.It wont cost you money. Its only objective is to let interested individuals know how it feels like to do business in the stock market. To acquaint individuals with the processes in the market.</td>

Alternately, you can buy ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds). There may be an ETF that tracks a specific mutual fund you are looking at. Vanguard has a huge list on their web site. You can buy the ETFs through a discount online broker like scottrade.com or etrade.com.

First, open the account jointly with a parent.  This will trigger brokerage fees when he turns 18 to change names.  It will probably run you $40 per position.

Second, open in only in your name.  The same problem will apply in terms of fees at age 18.

Third, open separate accounts with you as trustee in his account under either UGMA or UTMA.

There is also one other way to teach him how to invest.  Go to a stock game.  I would strongly recommend www.marketocracy.com.  It is very educational and runs like a real mutual fund.

<td>What are "life settlements" or "viatical settlements" and any recos on companies that deal with them?</td>
<td>A Life or Viatical Settlement occurs when a settlement company purchases unwanted life insurance policies from individuals for a lump sum. The settlement company then takes over the payment of premiums of the policy and essentially waits for the insured to die, thereby collecting the death benefit under the policy.

These settlement companies pool the assets from many investors together to fund the purchases of many policies, resulting in a pool of policies that will all eventually pay out a death benefit. The rate of return on the investment depends on how well the actuaries for the settlement company do their job. The key for the settlement company is to maximize the difference between the amount they pay the policyholder plus premium payments until the death of the insured and the death benefit payable.

I have been involved on the policy sales side before, and these companies can be a nice opportunity to diversify your holdings with an investment that has no correlation to the stock market, although it is my understanding that the minimum investment amount is pretty high.

Look at Coventry and Advanced Settlements.</td>

If you're lucky or skilled you can average 20% per year but it means taking a lot of risk of some sort.  Risk in junk bonds defaulting, or risk of huge losses in volatile stocks, or risk of distressed property not selling--whatever the investment vehicle 20% is a reasonable target only for the high-risk investor.  10% is the norm for stocks of large US companies.

I'm sorry, I don't know the currency you're referring to--is it South African rand?  How much to save is a highly personal thing and depends a lot on your age and the economic situation in your country.  Anyone in the US counting on Social Security in 30 years is living in a dangerous hallucination.  Republican mismanagement guarantees that all that will be left of Social Security will be a subsistence program to keep poor people from falling into total destitution.  It will be like welfare is now--anyone not covered will be grateful they're well-off enough to not qualify.  In these circumstances someone starting out should save at least 10% and someone in middle age should be saving 30% or more if they don't have several hundred thousand dollars in assets.</td>

They do on occasion facilitate the trades by committing their own capital (approximately 10% of the time) and as a matter of course disseminate information to the crowd that helps to bring buyers and sellers together. Most of the time natural buyers and sellers meet in a market that provides efficient price discovery in an auction environment that is designed to produce the fairest price for both parties. The human interaction and expert judgement as to order execution differentiates the NYSE from fully electronic markets. However, in excess of 50% of all order flow is now delivered to the floor electronically."</td>

I started a business making leather goods with only $300 investment. I already had most of the tools and supplies but I needed a wider range of leather. My first time selling netted $700 profit and I still had 3/4 of my supplies left. I turned it into a $80G a year business in two years.

One important factor in creating a business is passion. You have to love what you do.

From a cleaning service (everyone has enough supplies to do at least the first house or two..then you reinvest your money to grow), to house painting (more supplies but can be bought at dollar stores for the first house), and the list goes on.

I have built and sold 7 businesses in my life and am on business 8. Don't feel that once you start, thats where your stuck forever. Feel free to learn and grow with life. Get the book "Who moved my cheese" to help you learn how to move through tech changes.

Take a piece of paper and draw a page sized T on it. The right side is cons the left is pros. Write your abilities down on the pro side then pencil in the cons to having a business doing that ability. You will find one or two strengths to work on.

Once you find what you want to do, find someone who is doing it and ask some questions. You will need to know how long it took to become established. Does the business support them and or their family. Do they like what they do. If not, why.

2 out of three privately owned businesses fail the first year. They tend to work best when you have another job the first year or even two so you can reinvest your money to build the business. Its hard work but worth it if it makes you happy.</td>

The MAC market is slowly inching up...it's no where close to the windows dominance in the PC market but it's moving in the right direction. Apple is notorious for their innovation of cool and new products.

Recently it's been going up because
#1 - the market is going up
#2 - anticipation in new products from MacWorld
#3 - good earnings to be announced in a few weeks

However, it's hard to say if it'll keep going up after #2 and #3. A lot of good news may have already been priced into the stock. There's the old saying "Buy the rumor, sell the news"...we'll see if that happens this time</td>

Lastly, there are also IRA CDs that you can buy! Often, with the IRA or IRA CD, any taxes on your money will be put off, or "deferred", until you make any withdrawals.

If you owe money on your house that is a tax write-off I would not pay that off right away.  Pay off other high rate consumer debt first.

Born: 28 October 1955 
Birthplace: Seattle, Washington 
Best Known As: Founder and head of the Microsoft Corporation 
Bill Gates is the head of the software company Microsoft and one of the world's wealthiest men. Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft in the 1970s, though Allen left the company in 1983. Gates oversaw the invention and marketing of the MS-DOS operating system, the Windows operating interface, the Internet Explorer browser, and a multitude of other popular computer products. Along the way he gained a reputation for fierce competitiveness and aggressive business savvy. During the 1990s rising Microsoft stock prices made Gates the world's wealthiest man; his wealth has at times exceeded $75 billion, making Gates a popular symbol of the ascendant computer geek of the late 20th century.

Gates married Melinda French, a Microsoft employee, on 1 January 1994. The couple have three children: daughters Jennifer Katharine (b. 1996) and Phoebe Adele (b. 2002) and son Rory John (b. 1999)... Gates's personal chartiable initiative, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, has focused on global health issues, especially on preventing malaria and AIDS in poor countries; in 2005, ABC News reported that he had given away over six billion dollars in the previous five years... For their philanthropic activities, Time magazine named Bill and Melinda Gates (along with rock star and activist Bono its Persons of the Year for 2005.</td>

A hedge fund can invest in practically anything and can use a variety of techniques, derivatives, and commodities to achieve returns.  In theory, they'd make positive returns in down markets, for example, by taking short positions or selling Calls or buying Puts.  Hedge funds cannot advertise to the public, cannot post a website advertising their returns, cannot actively solicity investors, and their investors must meet minimum capitalization standards. People &amp; firms get into them for flexibility and ostensibly enhanced returns, say 20% instead of 5-8% normally expected, however what people often get out of hedge funds is really just a Beta play.  So it's best, in my opinion, to get into hedge funds as part of your overall portfolio.</td>

This is a topic that I have studied in much detail over the past 3 years. There are ALOT of ways to make money online, however, the moment you log on to the internet you are bombarded by ALOT of different sites telling you how to make money and that you`ll be a millionaire overnight. It takes time to filter out the crap from the genuine income generating programs. 

I have researched literally thousands of the different offers I'm sure you see every day on the internet. You could spend a fortune trying all these different business opportunities out for yourself. I did and believe me 95% of them didn't work but now I'm making quite a bit using a number of different websites. 

One of the ones I found worked best is Protry.com or DataEntryPros. 

Basically you sign up with them and then simply enter in lines of data they give you, send it back and they send you out a check! I get checks from them every 2 weeks each averaging around $200-$300. You could make more but I just use the site as an extra bit of cash aswell as my full time job (which I love!) so I only work on it for around an hour each night. 

You do have to be prepare to spend a small amount of money but just do what I did..all of these sites offer a 30 day money back guarantee..use them for 30 days, make some cash then just cancel the 
subscription...I know you won`t though! :o) 

Here`s the link you can get them at anyway -&gt; www.protry.com 

Hope this helps!

<td>explain how the working of options in stock market is?</td>
<td>An option is a contract, If you buy a "call" you have the right to buy a stock at the strike price, and seller is obligated if you "exercise" which means telling the seller you are buying the shares. 
For Example
You buy 1 contract (100 options) of Microsoft for $1 which will cost you $100 and lets say the strike price is at 25. Let's say Microsft is at 24 the option "real value" of the option is worthless because you won't want to  buy it at 25 from the seller if you can buy it from the market for 24. Now if the stock reaches lets say 50, You have the right to buy 100 shares of MSFT at 25, and then sell them immideatly at 50. The real value per share is $25 so you would get 2,500 dollars back.

Put options is the exact same thing, except you have the right to sell at the strike price, so If MSFT is at 15 and you have a put at 25, you have the right to buy the stock at 15 and then sell it at 25. (this transaction does not actually happen like this, but this is what makes it easy to understand).

Bad news about options, they expire. They have a date, which they would be worthless the day after expiration.

Also, you have an option to write, selling options on stocks you own is a way to reduce risk and possibly make free cash and increase yields if you know what you are doing. (that is what I do.)</td>

<td>Excellent question!  Basically it works like this:  Let's say there's a company making widgets, and this company is family owned.  They've grown to a large company and they want to expand even more.  They apply for an IPO, Initial Public Offering.  We're gonna take 49% of the value of this company...let's say $1 Million Dollars.  Let's say we want to sell 49% of this company to the public.  Each share of stock is priced at $10.

<td>I'm thinking of purchasing silver coins, any advice on which company to buy from?</td>
<td>I'd recommend buying coins on eBay.  Modern coins are commodity items almost like bullion, and the competition among sellers there is fierce.  If you're looking for collectible coins then you can get a quantity discount by buying a lot from a dealer or individual selling off a collection.  Again eBay is an excellent source.  With collectible coins, especially ones that aren't officially graded, you have to know what you're doing so you don't get caught in a bidding war and overpay.

Any dealer that is spending money advertising coins for investment is probably getting such a huge markup that the coin market would have to explode before you could break even.  I know whenever I see coins and stamps offered for sale outside of hobby magazines, the prices are always outrageous.

Even if you get a great deal it's very difficult to make money in coins unless you have the resources to buy large collections at a fraction of retail and then sell at or near retail.  If you're bullish on silver I think mining stocks are a much better way to leverage your money.</td>

<td>should I buy Google Stock or CVS?</td>

 First off, Walgreens is superior to cvs fundamentally, so I would go with Walgreens over cvs. This is supported by same store sales and margins, the two best metrics for these two companies. Also, this is a good industry to be in the next five years for three-fold. 1)The fed is @ it's 14th consecutive rate hike, and they are getting close to stopping. This is the best time to own a retail play, right before the fed stops (not after they do). 2) 78 million Baby boomers are turning 60 over the course of the next five years, and lets face it, they will need drugs, and most aren't really all that computer literate; Walgreens will do well here. Also, check out ESRX. 3) the stocks both cvs and walgreens appear to be @ a bottom.

As for Goog. The fundementals are there. They are trading a 50x next years earnings (9$ a share), so when they get $10 EPS, they should hit 500 easily. Also, the technolgy sector has lagged everyone the last 6 years, so we should see some more buying (corp. invesing in Tech in General) coming in within the next 2 years. Goog is in an organic co. right now, so that doesn't really matter, it is just icing on the cake.

I would do both + CCJ(uranium Nuclear Power) + Ati( Titanium Fabrication) + USG( Sheet Rock Building ETC, hence, hurricane rebuilding Etc)+ OXPS(online discount brokerage)</td>

Two things to do to make sure your safe 1. Run Anti-virus software, Adaware, and Spybot (or whichever malware program you use) often.

Make sure that when your entering your info you are on a secure server. You can do this by looking at the URL. A secure server will always start with https://yourbank.com instead of the normal http://yourbank.com.

Ultimately, they do receive financial benefit from the stock that trades in the market, as the volatility of the stock price directly affects the company's Beta, which is an input into the determination of a company's cost of capital.  The greater the volatility, the greater the risk, and, hence, the greater the company's cost of capital. 
A greater cost of capital increases costs for the company and also decreases the projects a company may take on, as a company must only take on projects that generate a positive Net Present Value, which will be affected by that company's cost of capital.</td>

Implied volatility appears in several option pricing models, including the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. 

In effect, implied volatility is determined by using a backwards approach from the option price.  The Black-Scholes option pricing model uses inputs such as volatility, stock price, etc. and give the option price as an output.  Using the output, and other available data, you can go backwards from the answer to find out what the volatility is - just takes some arithmetic.</td>

I'm assuming you live on base, and you eat your meals in a mess hall.

Here are the rules: Don't drink. Don't smoke. Don't buy a car. Don't blow your money on things you don't need. Eat meals at the mess hall as much as you can (I know it's disgusting, but tomorrow you won't kow the difference). Don't loan money to anyone (I made a few loans but it was like pulling teeth to get the money back, and sometimes I never did).

This is secondary, but also very important. Make sure your money is earning money. I made the mistake of not doing this soon enough.

The best way to see if the stock you are interested in offers a direct stock purchase, go to their website and look under the Investors information link. They will tell you if you can and how to buy direct.

You can also go to several known companies that manage direct stock purchase and look at their client list and buy direct. 
www.equiserve.com is the company that manages Exxon's purchase plan along with several hundred other companies. The web site lists the minimum amount and also the minimum if you want to invest monthly. You also have the option of reinvesting your dividends. I personally use Equiserve (Now Computer Share) to buy my Exxon stock monthly.

Mellon INvestors also manages direct stock purchase for many companies. I use them as well for another company I invest in monthly.

The Bank of New York manages the stock purchase plan for GE.

Buying direct is not only cheaper but also a nice way to accumulate the stock monthly and reinvest its dividends. For example, Exxon pays for all transactions except when I want to sell, which is $15. Other companies charge as little as $1 or $2 per transaction.</td>

If you want a high yield savings or CD account, check out ING direct. It's an online bank you link to your normal branch bank account. That's probably one of the safest places to place your money.

If you are willing to take more risk, the stock market historically returns 8-10% over time...An index fund or the Vanguard total stock market index fund may yield that over a period of time. 

Individual stocks yield the highest but are also the riskiest. These are definately more exciting but you need to be able to handle the ups and downs of the market.

You have to decide how much rick you are willing to take. But stay away from mutual funds or investments that guarantee something crazy..also, avoid all penny stocks.

<td>Should I short-sell Google stock (GOOG)?</td>
<td>Not unless you like lots of risk. Google is a very volatile stock.  There is no doubt that Google is over valued but let me remind you of the internet bubble of 1998-2000. These stock were overpriced in 1998 but that did not prevent them from rising another 5 fold--some of which were not worth the paper the certificates were printed on--Global Crossing comes to mind. Cisco was selling at 20 in 1998 and 100 in 2000. Now it under 20. And it is a good company. Google is too. 

If you really, really have a hanckering to short Google two ways to do it to minimize your risk are as follows: 1) is to buy a put on the stock. The put will give you a period of time to sell Google at a particular price. 

For example a 370 put expiring in the end of June 2006 will currently cost you $2100 for 100 shares. If the stock closes below $348 by the expiration date in June you will make money. If not you will loose your $2100 but nothing more. Of course you may ask why does the put cost so much when the stock is currently selling at 435.  Because a lot of people think it might be over priced. 

As the price of Google rises and falls, the price of the options also rises and falls and as the option approaches the expiration date, its value also falls.

2) short the stock and buy a call option. The call option gives you the ability to buy the stock at a given price for a given length of time. That way if Google rises 30 points the day after you short it, your loss is limited to the cost of the call option.</td>

<td>Last week, long term bond yield rates became lower than short term bond yield rates for the first time in a long while - signalling a recession. The markets dropped a significant amount in response. Historically, this indicator has never been wrong. Therefore, you should invest assuming the economy will be in recession.

Sectors are all cyclical and correspond with the current economic stage a country is in. In times of recession, the following sectors all do well:

At the beginning of recession:
1. Consumer Staples (food, etc.)
2. Healthcare (drugs, meds)
Reasoning: everyone needs to buy food and medicine no matter what state the economy is in. Stable demand for these companies results in above average returns.

During the recession:
3. Financial institutions (banks, insurance)
4. Utilities
Reasoning: these sectors usually have higher than average dividend yields, a safe bet for risk averse investors who want to make some money.

Therefore, those 4 sectors should do decently in 2006. 

PS:
Gold has already realized incredible gains during 2005. While it still has potential to go up especially with the recent acquisitions of Barricks, it is becoming increasingly risky.</td>

<td>give me some information regarding mutual funds?</td>
<td>Mutual Funds consists of a portfolio of securities which will be charged fees according to the fund manager rate that manages it.
By portfolio of securities i mean a package of different investment products such as, and including a mix of, term deposits, shares of different companies, governement bonds, currencies and many other types of investments.
By investing in mutual funds you expose yourself to a wider variety of securities that you would not normally have access to.
Also, due to economies of scale, the fund is able to buy large amounts of the security at a lower cost than if you were to buy it on your own.
You also get a professional to invest your money for you and you benefit from their expertise.
By investing in a mutual fund with its many securities you are not as exposed to the risk involved in owning just one security.  Basically you spread your risk over a wider variety.  Like betting on different teams for the playoffs.
But remember that they are only human and are also subject to bad decision making.
There is always a risk in any type of investment.
All you can do is minimize the risk.

<td>The short answer to your question is absolutely not. Apple is a great company with strong long-term upside potential, but if you are 72 years old and looking for something dependable, Apple does not meet your profile. Quite honestly, I'd seriously question investing in stocks at all in your position.  Perhaps investing in bonds would be the more prudent and dependable thing to do.  However, if you are intent on investing in the stock market I would focus on a large stable company that pays a high dividend. Examples of stocks that would fit this profile are: Proctor &amp; Gamble (Ticker: PG) and Altria (Ticker: MO). These companies generally hold up pretty well even in an economic downturn. Of these two, MO would carry slightly more risk than PG, but it has better upside and pays a better yield.  Hope this helps!</td>

While we're about 5 weeks away from the expiration of your options, time decay will start kickingin soon. Playing with options close to expiration is very risky.

Learning point : When you invest in options, set two exit "points". The lower one will serve to limit your loss. The upper one will require some mental discipline and limit your profits.

Many investors with a profitable stock/option want to let it ride. Unfortunately, even good stocks/options can quickly turn sour, costing you $$$. In the words of Jim Cramer...

<td>Rich is a subjective word. Do you mean rich as in a net worth of one million dollars, one million dollars in 2005 dollars, or do u mean more like 15 million or more?

Rich is defined by the individual or surounding individuals. If one man with a net worth of 150,000 walks into a homeless shelter to help, the people there may look at him as being rich, although if the same man walked into the Chicago Board of Trade (Which I believe still holds the record for having the largest number of millionaires per square foot) he would be considered poor. 

The only way to truly become wealthier is to earn economic profit, and the only way to do that is by exploiting market potential. Market potential is everywhere in America, you just need to open your eyes a little wider and you will see all the possibilities to earn economic profit, and meet your goal of what you believe it means to be rich. 

There is definatly no system that can make a person rich in 20 years. If someone claimed a system existed and everyone got involved and it actually produced money it would mealy be inflationary more than anyhting. 

You should also understand that money doesn't buy goods and services, goods and services buy goods and services, money is just the medium of exchange. So more money doesn't mean you can buy more. The more goods and services you provide the more you can get in exchange.</td>

Sharebuilder charges about $15.95 for real time trades. They also have a program where you can "dollar cost" average into a stock. Say you want to invest $50/month into Apple, $25/month into ebay, and $10/month into Starbucks. It'll cost you $4/month/"automatic transaction". You can also subscribe to their package deals where they give you 20 automatic transactions for $20. 6 trades/month for $12. The trick though is..you have to invest the same day every month and they execute the trade. You have no control over when (morning/afternoon or time). This is fine if you want to accumulate stock.

I do like eTrade for their interface but their trades are $15 unless you do X trades a month and the price goes down...but for a small investor, it's cheaper to go with the $7 trades at Scottrade</td>

The weakness of US Dollar, higher fuel prices are other reasons.  Gold, being the traditional safe haven, is attracting money away from dollar.</td>

<td>Are President Bush's financial policies helping or hurting the economy?</td>
<td>That's a political question, and political questions always have multiple answers.

George Bush has done things that help the economy, such as cutting taxes. However, he has also presided over a huge expansion over the federal government, at a time when it needs to be reduced in actual size.

Upon reflection, the phrase 'President Bush's financial policies' is probably not very accurate. Let's say that G-Dub does have financial policies/theories that he would like to implement (I don't know if he does or what they really would be). He has five groups of people to contend with: 1) his advisors, 2) Republicans in the Senate, 3) Democrats in the Senate, 4) Republicans in the House, and 5) Democrats in the House. By the time said policies are shaped in such a way to be palatable to all those groups, who knows if they would resemble the original at all.

For me, I am not very concerned with the President's legacy; the only thing that matters to me is whether or not we made the right choice. To determine the answer to that we have to compare it against the alternative (Senator Kerry, or the other various Democrats that Kerry defeated in the 2004 Democratic primary). I can assure you that based upon that comparison, President Bush's financial policies have been far superior than his opponent's would have been.</td>

<td>What should I be saving for retirement?</td>
<td>My parents always said to "pay myself first." This means that I should contribute as much as I possibly can to any retirement accounts. If your employer is willing to pay 70 cents on the dollar up to 15% of your salary, you really should consider bumping up your contributions. The more you contribute now will add up to a lot more over the long run.

Does your 401K company allow you to pick how the money is invested? If they do, you should think about doing an aggressive growth tactic. I'm not saying have all of your money go toward aggressive growth, but that's where a large portion of it should go. The key is to diversify and have your money working for you in a variety of ways. Since time is on your side, you can afford to be a little more aggressive and assume a little more risk. 

The compounding interest adds up over time, so the more you contribute now, the more you'll have when you retire.

Check out the calculators I've provided below. They can help to paint a better picture. I would also recommend talking to a financial planner. I hope this helps, and remember, pay yourself first =).</td>

If you need to access the money you paid in, you can generally get a home equity line of credit (HELOC) on your home for free.

<td>Is there anyway to squeeze more money out from a bank with large sum of money that I have ready for invesment?</td>
<td>No. You can't squeeze money out of a bank.  However, you can reduce your costs and therefore increase your potential return. Most mutual funds have "break points" at which they reduce the sales charge. Most start at about $25k. You can get the break points by contributing smaller amounts over a 13 month period. You would use a "letter of intent" to do so. You would still need to meet the $25k requirement, but could do so over time.

Another option would be a "Managed Account" with a brokerage firm. Minimums run about $25-50k depending on the firm. The advantage is that you pay only a small fee as a percentage of assets under management.

It is very likely that the country will submerge in an economic recession until foreing cash starts flowing in again.

You can't buy stocks through any company, you must purchase them through a broker.  I have sharebuilder, but you can use any other online trading firm.  (Okay, I probably am wrong on this after reading other's posts.)

There is no way to get rich super quick....it's a game, and you have to study to learn how to play.

Read up on dollar-averaging, it's where you buy more stock when the price is low, and less stock when the price is higher.  It only works if you invest the same amount on a timely basis.

One more thing about Sharebuilder.com, they do not require you to buy a whole share; you can buy fractional shares.</td>

<td>when will the price of silver go down, and what makes it go so high in the first place?</td>
<td>World production of silver from mining was 19,500 metric tons in 2004. Estimated world reserves that are unmined are about 570,000 metric tons of silver. 

Silver's value is connected to both its consumption and use and its reputation as a precious metal. Many people believe that silver is underpriced because they believe there is a set ratio between the value of gold and silver, and that as gold climbs in value the price of silver should go with it.

At present there is a 1700 metric ton per year deficit between world demand and world silver supply including mine production and scrap silver recycling. Silver is used primarily by industry for photographic materials, electrical and electronic goods, catalysts, brazing alloys, dental amalgam, and bearings. Use of silver for jewelry, tableware, decorative items, and coinage are significantly smaller than the industrial consumption.  Even though the use of silver in photographic films is in decline due to widespread adaptation of digital cameras, the industrial demand it rising beyond the available supply. This is the primary reason behind silver's recent price increase in my opinion. 

Another factor that must be considered for any commodity like silver, oil, or even gold that are priced on world markets in US dollars is that the US dollar has lost about 30 percent of its value over the past four years. Since most silver, oil, and gold is produced outside the United States, the producers hope to get the same amount in their own currency, so when the dollar falls the prices of many dollar denominated commodities rises. A rise in the value of the dollar could translate into lower prices for silver.</td>

On the long term and since 1981 long-term interest rates (the 30 years treasury bond) have steadily gone down from 14.5% to 4.7%.

This is due to the fact that credit discriminates against the poor. So rich get richer and poor get poorer.

The marginal use of the money for the rich is savings the marginal use of the money for the poor is consumption.

More and more money (savings) are chasing investments. The revenues of those investments is the consumption which is going down relative to the mean of revenues.

"Foreign Exchange" is the simultaneous buying of one currency and selling of another. Currencies are traded in pairs, for example Euro/US Dollar (EUR/USD) or US Dollar/Japanese Yen (USD/JPY). 
There are two reasons to buy and sell currencies. About 5% of daily turnover is from companies and governments that buy or sell products and services in a foreign country or must convert profits made in foreign currencies into their domestic currency. The other 95% is trading for profit, or speculation.</td>

If you buy a house for yourself, go with a fixed rate mortgage.  Mutual Funds might provide a better answer as they have historical offered a higher rate of return.

According to financial theory widely accepted and used in practise. The only investment with a guaranteed return is FDIC insured accounts or goverment bonds. Beyond that the more risk you are willing to take the greater returns you can expect.

A financial advisor can help you assess you risk tolerance level and then advise you how much of your investment to allocate to US stocks, International Stocks, bonds, and/or cash.

If any investment was certain to be worth more next year, the price would have already risen today.

ROC = Rate of Change, which is designed to show how fast a stock's price is changing.

MFI = Money Flow Index, which is supposed to indicate how strong a particular stock's price trend is

RSI = Relative Strength Indicator (or Index), which tries to use a number to indicate in what direction a stock is moving and with how much force

W%R = I don't know the exact words, but I've heard it called the Williams indicator, which is designed to determine if a stock is overbought or oversold.  I'm not sure what the underlying analysis consists of.

<td>Technical analysts: When calculating or plotting Fibonacci retracements, do you use close or high/low prices?</td>
<td>You can look at retracements on all time frames. The longer the time frame, the more reliable the fibonacci level will be. Focus on the normal ones also. Weeklies, dailies and if you are doing intraday look at the hourly. I'm a bit confused about the (calculated on entire range) question. If you are looking at a charting screen you will plot from the absolute low or close to the absolute high or close. The fiboncci will change depending on how far you are zoomed in on the chart screen. Look for areas where prior support or resistance converge with fibnoccia retracements.

edited info:
If you are looking at 6months worth of data on a daily chart you will plot the fibonacci from the lowest low to the highest high. You will need to try different views on the same chart for example, (6months of data of daily chart will have different fibonnacci levels then a years worth of data fora daily chart).
Some charting packages will use the lows and highs others will use closes. It doesnt really make a difference. Experiment with both and see which one tends to hold more often. You will get a better feel for them the more you use them. Just keep plotting and try different things, you will begin to figure out which ways work best.</td>

Given current interest rates for savings, you are probably better paying down the mortgage than holding onto the cash.

401K reasonable. Couple of things may happen...where the company contribution goes and where your contribution goes. Also, generally takes 3 to 5 years to be fully vested so you "get" the entire company contribution. If you go this way, take advantage of the maximum employer contribution. It's free money!

ROTH IRA  Taxed before you put it in so you aren't taxed when you take it out (Traditional IRA's are the exact opposite). Suggest you contact a broker, start a monthly contribution to a ROTH in a solid mutual fund. A good broker will sit with you and discuss your risk tolerance.

If you can afford to do a 401 and an IRA, do both.

Regardless of what plan you choose, get started now and make monthly contributions.</td>

<td>Is it a good investment to invest into foreign currency?</td>
<td>Investing in a new currency is like investing in a new stock. Prices depend on demand and supply. But in the currency market, additional complication develops due to internationally relative factors such as inflation rates and policies that might affect export-import activities.

In the short run, I dare say that if the new currency is used for purchasing iraqi products, and if the demand for iraqi products is high, there will be huge demand for the new currency, and of course it will sky rocket in value.

However, I expect that other currencies will be in use concurrently (in practice) for some time, like in the Euro case (so, even if you gain, it would not be that much - think about this: if all contracts are priced in USD, there would be no needs to buy the Iraqi currency). Are you willing to take risks of self-adjusting machanism of the currency market?

You can also talk to a financial advisor.  Your local bank is a good place to start.  You can also find a financial advisor the American Express.  You can also open an account with one of the online trading companies.  However, research these carefully/.  I also suggest setting up a special bank account if you are going to do this.  This will prevent someone from using you online account to completely wipe out your savings.  

One last thing remember the market is an extremely volatile and you need to research any company prior to investing in it.  And any investment you make may bring larger rewards are extremely large disapointments.

<td>WhAT IS etf?</td>
<td>An Exchange Traded Fund -It's like an Index mutual fund with a specific objective such as "high dividend paying Dow stocks" "Bio tech companies". The difference is that an ETF trades throughout the day and mutual funds trade at the closing price of the day. With ETF's you pay a commision per purchase as you would with any stock purchase. Many mutual funds have no fee/commission to buy their shares. However, mutual funds have an expense ratio that typically costs you 1% or more of total assets per year. ETF's are typically 1/3 of 1% or .33%. The savings in expense costs can by in the thousands over a long period of time. I would suggest buying an ETF if you plan on holding it for a long period of time. You should also buy in as large a chunk as you can afford to avoid the costly commisions. No load Mutual funds on the other hand are more suited for investors that want to make small and/or regular purchases. For mutual funds I would suggest Vanguard. Low cost and solid management. If interested in ETF's go with a reputable discount broker- Schwab, etc.. I hope this helps

Good Luck, Jim</td>

<td>Having recently left the area, I know first hand that the quality of life there is very good, low crime, good schools and (formerly) light traffic. With the housing boom there the traffic is much worse, but it is still better than other places nearby. 
 
Although it used to be a "bargain" compared to places in the Valley, I think the prices rose faster and the prices are more in line now. As long as the schools stay good and crime stays low it will be an attractive area to live in.</td>

<td>What are some great ways to invest money to see a good return in about a year/couple of years?</td>
<td>Disregard that last well meaning answer.  There are two parts to your question.  The first is where are some greate ways to invest money.  The second is to see a good return in a couple of years.  The second constrains the first.

The problem is that equity mutual funds (of which Vanguard is a great provider) are really decade or longer investments.  The market is very high right now in absolute terms.  The odds of making a great return in a few years is pretty low.  About the only thing that can give you a good return in a few years with any margin of safety is a certificate of deposit.

I did a search on bankrate monitor.  The two best rates are at AMTrust in Cleveland, Ohio, with a yield of 5.00% for a two year investment.  A $1000 investment would yield a total value of $1102.50 ignoring taxes at maturity.  Slightly lower, Pacific Mercantile Bank is offering a yield of 4.92% per year in Costa Mesa, California.

If you wanted a one year CD, Corus Bank in Chicago is offering a 4.94% annual yield for its one year CD.

If you lift the constraint of a year or two to a more indefinite horizon and would include equity mutual funds.  I would recommend the following funds, Mutual Financial Services Z (symbol TEFAX) only warning is that it is very globally diversified, Fairholme (FAIRX), American Century Value Inv (ACTIX), BB&amp;T Large Company Val I(BBISX).  You can buy these from discount brokers.  In BB&amp;T's case, you can go into their branch and purchase it.  TD Waterhouse is reasonable in terms of purchase costs and you may be able to purchase directly from the funds.  Check each out online to see if they offer direct purchase. 

They take different risks, but you should avoid too much grief in any of them and over time you should do reasonably well.  A combination of them might be in your interest if your time frame is long.  You should presume you will not do well in the next few years however.</td>

<td>What investment do you get the most for your return, ex: cds, stocks, etc.?</td>
<td>when you mean "most for your return" I am thinking you mean either the greatest return with a minimum amount of risk, or I am thinking you mean overal greatest return. Risk and return have a fairly close correlation, so becides fixed incomes such as CD's, Government Bonds and Treasury's, the Risk and Return tend to be relative. Example; Stock might have a 50/50 chance of making 10% and loosing 10%, where Futures might have a 50/50 chance of gaining 25% and loosing 25%. If any one marketable security was superior in than Return was greater than Risk relative to other investments the market would immediately exploit it and the opportunity would dissapate to become relativly equivelent. 

And an investment that just has the highest potential return would be simply to purchase a marketable security probably a future purchased on almost fully on margin, that means you barrow the money to buy the future, and keep all the gains and looses and pay only a low rate of interest on the barrowed funds.  This can significantly increase risk and return if held more than a few weeks (normally an investment like this would be held for less than one day) making or loosing 40-300% could be very normal.</td>

<td>My son received money from a lawsuit from a serious dog bite that left him?</td>
<td>Yahoo! is good for some answers, not for others. Ask your lawyer to recommend a stockbroker or financial advisor, and ask him/her this question.

There is a thing called risk-return ratio. The more you risk, the higher the (possible) return. If you put the money in a CD, it will get 3% - 5% and be as safe as you can get. Other investment have higher risks. To take an extreme example, if you put $1,000 into a one-year CD at 4%, at the end of the year you'd have $1,004, unless the US Government collapsed. 

If, on the other hand, you flew to Las Vegas and put your $1,000 on "Red" at a roulette table, at the end of 45 seconds you'd have either $2,000 or nothing. Roulette carries a lot of risk, but the returns are high.

Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate partnerships, rare coins and stamps, uncut diamonds, race horses, classic muscle cars, old paintings - there are risks and possible returns with all of them. You have to decide how much risk you are comfortable with. Any banker, stockbroker or financial advisor worthy of the name will tell you the same thing. 

Long-term CD's are guaranteed by the FDIC; they almost always have the highest return for virtually no risk. 1-year CD's are running about 4.12% today (see link).

If the finacial advisor you go to has a sure-fire way to get over 8% a year, with NO risk, put one hand onyour wallet and walk away, slowly, never taking your eyes off his hands.

There are ways to get a 10%, 20% or 30% return on your money. They all carry some amount of risk of a 10%, 50% or 100% loss. The higher the potential return, the higher the potential risk.</td>

<td>how to come to right valuation for the startup company?</td>
<td>Valuation can be based on Earnings.  Say your business is similar to a public company that has a P/E ratio of 20 and is in a sector whose average P/E ratio is say, 25.  Once you calculate your earnings, you can use this reference metric to establish the price of a share of your startup.  You'd have to take into account relative market capitalization.

Free Cash Flow (FCF) is, however, the more likely measurement.  Typically, investors look for NPV of your FCF using a discount factor appropriate to your line of business.

You've already mentioned that Revenue (sales?) could be another way.

In all cases, you need to get your pro forma financial statements done in order to establish/estimate these figures.  Investors want proof that you've done your homework before they hand over cash.  There's no "right" way but there are common ways, depending on the business sector.</td>

For example it is possible to purchase complete hotel (fantastic downtown commercial area) for between 1 000 000 and 5 500 000 dollars (one such was bought couple of days ago). You can also buy lots or very old and lousy houses and turn it in commercial building. For such business you would need somewhere between 50 000 to 500 000 dollars (to get land in downtown area), and then to pay building costs (I really don't know how much is it there). Anyway, for great commercial investment you will certainly need more than 500 000 or 1 000 000 dollars in any European city (Belgrade is one of the most expensive regarding to real-estate, so other European cities might have lower costs). You can also buy couple of offices and put them on sale (that would cost of 100 000 dollars or more per office and will bring minimal return rate of about 6%, or more depending on how much offices are available.</td>

<td>is it possible to save money when you only make average wages?</td>
<td>Yes. Saving is not about Big Numbers. It isn't even about Little Numbers Across A Long Time. It is about Consistent Numbers Across Any Time.

Saving money certainly involves "not buying stuff." But this view is far too narrow. So long as saving is equated with sacrifice it will be an uphill battle to save. Having day-to-day life that is as stress-free as possible is very important. Continual sacrifice and stress-free living clash harshly for many people. Some people focus on changing lifestyle-related choices, sometimes called the "latte factor," as a method for realizing day-to-day savings. I agree that this is good advice for some people, but as a first step it isn't necessarily the most effective. There are other things that can be done, too.

1. Reduce monthly fees. Stop paying banking fees for services you don't use or don't need. Many banks charge monthly "service fees" or "maintenance fees" for checking accounts. If your bank offers "free checking" or "free checking with Direct Deposit" (and you have Direct Deposit) switch your account, or find a bank that does offer "free checking." Even the smallest leak in any plumbing system will eventually collect enough water to fill a bathtub, so to will even the smallest recurring monthly service fee eventually steal one month's rent.

2. Detemine a reasonable monthly budget. It is important to know "where it all goes." Rent, utilities, cell phone, car payment, insurance, groceries. There is no doubt these numbers exist, but most importantly nearly all of them can be known in advance. Some of them can't be known exactly, but they can be estimated. My advice is to estimate unknown amounts not for the sake of accuracy ("The cell phone bill is usually $40.00 per month."), but for the sake of certainty ("The cell phone bill has never been more than $80.00 in any month."). In the beginning of making and using budgets, budgets work best when costs are overestimated rather than underestimated. It is far less uncomfortable to have "too much" money left at the end of the month than it is to have "too little" left over--and bills still to be paid, at the end of the month.

3. Begin saving automatically. If your employer offers Direct Deposit, and you can open a "free checking" account (with or without Direct Deposit), use this financial automation to the maximum. Open a second checking account. Then contact your HR department to request that your paychecks be split across your two checking accounts.

4. Separate paying bills from saving and investing. Use your primary account for all monthly expenses: rent, utilities, food, car payments and pet food. This is your "Cash" account. The second checking account is dedicated for saving and investment purposes. You won't draw funds from this "Investment" account to pay bills. That isn't what saving is about. Saving is about having money available to fund medium-term and long-term goals. Things like retirement, paying college tuition or buying a home. The "Investment" account will drive all of your automatic saving and investment mechanisms. Similar to Direct Deposit, Automatic Withdrawals can be scheduled to transfer funds from your "Investment" account.

Here is how to implement the above steps.

Look at the ING Direct website. ING has savings accounts with excellent interest rates, without no minimum required balance. In addition look at the Vanguard website. If you don't have an IRA, 401k or any other kind of retirement account Vanguard has the lowest custodial costs ($10.00 per year) and lowest minimum required balances (usually $3,000.00) of any financial services company today. Accumulating enough money to open an account with Vanguard may take some time, but getting started saving with ING Direct is something that can occu</td>

<td>Is today a good day to buy gold?</td>
<td>IMO Gold is an "insurance policy" not an investment.  

In general, gold rises under a few conditions: 
Economic instability
Lowering value of the dollar
Increased inflation

You can certainly speculate by buying gold, but you're betting that one of the above conditions takes place or increases in magnitude.  

Over time, gold has shown itself to be a poor investment in comparison to stocks, bonds etc. But an excellent hedge against inflation and monetary collapse.

Nowadays many people think that a repeat of 1929 - 1939 is impossible. It is not.  It is prudent for anyone to have a portion of their portfolio in gold as insurance against a similar future collapse because gold has historically been a store of value from ancient times to today.</td>

That was my fault.  Internal Rate of Return is used for capital budgeting a lot.  The cashflows should exceed the initial investment, for a profitable outcome.  

So, when figureing the return for your investment, in Excel the number in the first cell has to be negativee.  Then enter an offsetting equal positive number in another cell within the formula.  Then, enter your cash inflows, from your transactions individually in the other cells, like I said before.

<td>Is the new Iraqi Dinar going up in Value or stable?</td>
<td>The Iraqi dinar essentially has a fixed value at 1477 dinars to 1 US dollar. The dinar is not traded outside of Iraq and has no value outside of that country. You cannot redeem dinars at your local bank because there is no foreign exchange in dinars. Because contractors in Iraq need a way to convert US dollars to Iraqi dinars in order to pay Iraqi subcontractors, there is a need to keep the currency at a fixed stable rate. The value has fluctuated less than 1% since the exchange was opened by the Coalition. The exchange is now operated by the Central Bank of Iraq, but the auction prices have not changed. 

Here was today's currency auction:
http://www.cbiraq.org/cbs6.htm

My own assessment of the dinar is that it is extremely unlikely to rise in value when it is allowed to float. Iraq will take years to develop oil resources, maybe decades. Current production is lower than before the war. Many wells in Iraq were shut-in for the war and will have to be redrilled or repaired to be able to produce again. The war has set Iraq back a long way in terms of oil production due to damaged wells, and infrastructure. At present the risk of trying to drill for oil in Iraq is so high that no oil company is willing to take it. An oil rig makes a really big well-lighted target that can't move, and bombers and snipers make it impossible to operate safely with something as explosive as natural gas and oil. When the country becomes stable and is able to increase oil production far above its currently insignificant levels, it has a chance of becoming a flourishing economy. Until then the Iraqi dinar is likely to fixed and not traded freely in order to prevent a total collapse of the value. 

Without outside government support of the dinar it would likely follow the path ot the Turkish lira and reach several million dinar to the dollar. In other words, it is likely to become more valuable as a collectors item than it is for face value.</td>

<td>What's the point of the Treasuries Bond (4.25%) if CD pays more (4.97%)??</td>
<td>In theory CD's are more risky, because if there is a major economic crash of biblical proportion, the banks would go bankrupt, but the government could just print more money and give what would be   worthless dollars. As a disastor of super biblical proportion is unlikely and even if it did happen, T-bills would also be worth nothing due to the worthless dollars. So screw the theory, the reason T-bills are sometimes more interesting  even that you can sell them and get your money back the same day, which you can not do with CD's. plus if interest rates go down, you could make a nice profit (nice for low risk investments, boring for stocks). The best case scenerio I could think of for treasuries, were at the peak of the bubble, if you bought long term bonds, the 30 year one when the fed funds rate was at 6%, and held on till rate droped to 1%, you would have more than doubled your investment, but that does not happen often in the bond world.</td>

<td>Direct Dividend Reinvestment Plans - Called DRIP funds.  

I started investing when I was 18.. The fees I was paying to buy &amp; sell stock took huge chunks out of my capital so if the stock went down and I had to sell it - or, on the other hand, if I had made gains.. the fees were taking 1 - 5% of my profits.  

If I was doing it over, no-fee DRIP funds would be my choice.  I would choose a solid company like Altria (MO) or Southern Company (SO) with a decent dividend payout and good company fundamentals (or at least a solid business plan).  The dividends are reinvested for free so you don't have to pay to invest more money in the account.

You need to shop around.  The DRIP I'm in.. is Colonial Properties.  It's a no fee DRIP but it's in a potentially tricky market - it's a REIT (Real estate investment trust).  I could lose my shirt with this stock but it's an example of some of the no fee drips out there.

Read the fool.com article on what a DRIP is and some of the basics

The second link has a list of the no fee DRIPs.  Pick out some companies you know.. do a little research on what the company does and how it's been doing.  You may want to pick a company that is solid and pays a solid dividend.  Southern Company is an example.

[edit] of course this is assuming you won't need that money for awhile.  If you do.. go with paypal or Capital One's high yield savings account.</td>

<td>Is FOREX (foreign exchange trading) easy to learn and get started in?</td>
<td>Having traded the FOREX for some time, I would say that learning and getting started are both easy. Making money however is quite hard. I would go to one of the FX broker websites and look for one that has a free demo account. Start your pretend trading account with a few thousand pretend dollars and when and ONLY when you have doubled it, open a real account with real money. You might lose all of that a few times before you get it right, as psychologically it is harder to trade with real money than imaginary money. Don't quit your day job right away. 

The link below will take you to FX Street which is an excellent news site about the FX market, and will give you a list of FX brokers, many of whom can open a free demo account for you. FXCM is one of those brokers, also linked below. This is NOT an endorsement of FXCM. You may need to find a broker in your country of choice, and you should know that you can open an account in almost any currency you want to use as your base currency if you find the right brokers. 

You should study up on technical trading, interpretation of chart patterns etc, and if you prefer a fundamental approach study macroeconomics and try to understand what economic events and forces will change the flow of currency. 

I would not recommend spending a lot of money on some sort of magic software that supposedly tells you when to trade. I started that way and eventually did better trading without the expensive software than I did with it. The only ones making money with most of the fancy software out there are the ones selling the software. After all, if their software was so good, why do they need to sell it? They should be rich from trading their own accounts.

Also, look on Yahoo! groups for some support groups. They are quite active and can steer you towards group meetings in your area, training seminars, and even have live trading sessions with IM in the middle of the night.</td>

<td>What do you think about investing in Forex Trading?</td>
<td>I'm not sure what you mean so I will try to hit every possibility. If I could find a way to invest in a Forex trading company, much like people buy stock in stock brokers, I would probably do it. I think the FOREX market is goiing to become more and more popular among small traders and every time one of them trades the broker makes money off of the pip spread. At the same time, there have been some spectacular failures out there caused by corruption such as the now infamous Refco. 

Another way to invest in Forex is to use a broker traded account, where you put up the money and the broker does the trading. I have never seen statistics on this, but would not trust my broker to make trades for me, but that's just me. I don't trust my auto mechanic either. 

As for doing your own trading, I think it has great potential if your mindset is such that you make a good trader. I have friends who have made as much as $35,000 in a month trading Forex. I have others who have lost their entire trading account. It is a high risk game so unless you are either good at taking high risk and winning, or know how to always limit your risk, you will likely struggle with Forex trading. There are mathematical ways to limit your risk, but even these don't keep you from experiencing a gambler's ruin where every bet loses. Each month there is a broker who runs a contest for the best return among its clients. They often have 300-400% returns over the month. The broker rewards them with prizes, but what they don't say is how many people had a loss compared to winners. Forex is a zero-sum trading business, for every winner there is a loser. In the stock market it doesn't work that way. 

I traded actively for a couple of years and did not make any impressive amount of money over the long term. Sure I had days where I had incredible profits on trades that took only minutes. Other days I lost money just as fast. My strategy on Forex these days: I have been buying stock in Canadian and Latin American companies and am getting a good return. Not only are these good economies but as the American dollar falls they gain in value. Also, I no longer have to get up at 2 am to check the London market opening, or stay up all night watching my trades. 

Try a free demo account from one of the big Forex brokers. When you have doubled your money, and not until you have doubled it, open a real account with real money. That is the best way to find out if you can trade Forex. 

Don't spend money on fancy software that tells you when to trade. You can find the same trading signals without using the software and learn more about how the technical signals work. Join the Yahoo! Forex trading groups. Learn from others if you want to try it.</td>

<td>What are the disadvantages of a 401k?</td>
<td>good question.  401k's are excellent vehicles for preparing for retirement.  The greatest part about them is that usually your company gives you free money when you participate, called a match.  The way it usually works is that you decide how much, either dollars or a percentage of your income, you want to put in to the plan.  Then you decide which investments to pick (this can be tricky without knowing what they offer).  Ask the person offering the plan to help. Use a mix.

Whatever you put into the plan is deducted from your income.  Heres an example:

Your income:               $40,000
Contribution amt:   5%:    $2000 
Company match 50c per $:   $1000 
up to 5%                    

Total contribution:        $3000

(New taxable income:$38,000)

If you do this until normal retirement age of 60 and get a 10% return on your money over that time, you'll end up with almost $1,200,000.  

Since now youre only taxed on $38,000, when you decide to retire and get your money you have to pay taxes on all the money you take out (not the whole $1.2 million unless you take it all at once).  If you take it out before your 59 1/2 you will have to pay an additional 10% penalty on whatever you take out. There are exceptions.

These are pretty much the pros and cons, but if you start now and stay consistent you'll be able to retire very comfortably.</td>

<td>ok this is kind of a follow up to a previous question that i miss phrased i understand a IRA is just an acct:?</td>
<td>Yes, an IRA is a type of account. Anything type of security or product that you can hold in an IRA can be held in a non-IRA account. The IRA is for tax purposes.

There is no simple answer to the question 'what are some high return mutual funds.' Allow me to explain.

A mutual fund that I once owned has grown by 104% in the past year (yes, that means double your money in 12 months). You might think that is a good mutual fund, but for most people it isn't. Most people aren't comfortable keeping their money in an industry that is rife with government corruption (Russian oil), and most people aren't comfortable with the possibility of losing a third of their investment in one quarter.

Risk isn't just about being able to keep your food down when you read an account statement. Think about it: If you lose 40% of your investment in the first half of the year, you need returns of 67% in the second half just to break even for the year. And just breaking even means losing money when you factor in inflation.</td>

An investment program that allows you to contribute small amounts of money (as little as $20 a month) in regular intervals. Funds are automatically deducted from your checking/savings account or your paycheck, and invested in a retirement account or mutual fund.

This is one of the best ways to save money. By "paying yourself first" many people find they invest more in the long run. Their investments are treated as another part of their regular budget. It also helps to force you to pay for investments automatically, so don't forget and spend all your money on impulse.</td>

If you have 100$ for example as saving, I suggest you keep 33% of it in safe deposit, invest 33% in secure stocks, and take risk or do learning with 34%, so you wont loose all. 

Its better to start with any online company in the initial phase. and yes if you want to learn trading try to find some game or go to this website www.fxplayer.com or FXCM trading website become their member and start dummy forex trading, it will help you in understanding the logics and tricks of trading.

<td>What are a few hot IRA's i can purchase with lil to no capital to get started on my retirement..?</td>
<td>What you read above is correct. An IRA is merely an investment vehicle. I advise you not to buy stocks until you have educated yourself about what you should buy. I myself have been investing in mutual funds for the past for a little over four years. If done properly, there are no fees involved, but in most cases you will need a minimum of $500-$3000 to start OR $50 to $100 per month (that is per fund, and I recommend that you diversify by owning more than one).

I'm not sure if you're interested in a regular or a Roth IRA (that's probably a question for tomorrow), but I'll tell you what I would do to get started:

Start putting your money in a high-yield savings account. I recommend ING Direct, Emigrant-Direct, or Virtual Bank. These are all money market accounts that link to your checking account (like Paypal). These will earn between 3.5 to 4.75% a year (each one has a different rate, I personally am moving my money to ING Direct right now because they have the highest current rate, but they fluctuate).

Saving is the most important thing. You might have found an investment that will return 20 or 30 percent, but it means nothing if you haven't saved any money to invest. Once you know how much money you will have to invest, you can project how much money you will have to invest on say, December 31, and you can project how much money you will be able to save each additional month.

Based on these numbers you can go out and research some funds. I like to use Morningstar's website to research mutual funds (no need to sign up for the premium membership). On their website you can see minimums for initial investment, and minimums for initial and subsequent AIP (automatic investment plan). If you were to begin investing $500 and then invested $100 each month thereafter, $500 would be your initial AIP and $100 would be your subsequent AIP.

I could give you some fund recommendations, but I'm not going to do that here. You may email me if you wish. Also, if you're interested in getting a $20 bonus to sign up for Virtual Bank, I can send you a link for that.</td>

<td>I have a question about the NPV function in Excel?</td>

Therefore, to use Excel to calculate your example, you must exclude the Period 0 cash flow from the NPV function, i.e. "=-500+NPV(0.09,150,150,150,150,150)". This will give the correct answer of $83.45.

The second issue is when calculating by hand, your discounting formula should be [year 1 = 150/(1+0.09)^1; year 2 = 150/(1+0.09)^2; etc.] Summing the results of this calculation method will also yield $83.45.</td>

<td>How are mortgage stocks effected (ie CMO, IMH) by interest rate hikes?</td>
<td>As interest rates fall people will refinance at the new lower rates. Investors in mortgage backed securities with have their principal returned to them early. This is known as "reinvestment risk", as investors will have to find a new place for the money and the interst rates will be lower. CMO's try to midigate this risk by establishing trantches (www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tranches.asp).

As interest rates rise pre-payments will decline reducing reinvestment risk. However, the investor will still be exposed to interest rate risk. Meaning that new issues of mortgage backed securities will offer higher returns. The rates of default will increase for marginal borrowers with adjustable rates. In most cases this won't affect the investor, as the bank will foreclose and liquidate the asset. In both cases you will have credit risk, but this in minor, as they are backed by the assets (properties).

<td>What does the DOW Jones average mean?</td>
<td>Dow Jones Averages Overview


The Dow Jones Industrial, Transportation and Utilities Averages are maintained and reviewed by editors of The Wall Street Journal. For the sake of continuity, composition changes are rare, and generally occur only after corporate acquisitions or other dramatic shifts in a component's core business. When such an event necessitates that one component be replaced, the entire index is reviewed. As a result, multiple component changes are often implemented simultaneously. 

While there are no rules for component selection, a stock typically is added only if it has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth, is of interest to a large number of investors and accurately represents the sector(s) covered by the average. 

Unlike the DJTA and DJUA, which include only transportation and utilities stocks, the DJIA is not limited to traditionally defined industrial stocks. Instead, the index serves as a measure of the entire U.S. market, covering such diverse industries as financial services, technology, retail, entertainment and consumer goods. 


Calculation

The Dow Jones averages are unique in that they are price weighted rather than market capitalization weighted. Their component weightings are therefore affected only by changes in the stocks' prices, in contrast with other indexes' weightings that are affected by both price changes and changes in the number of shares outstanding. 

When the averages were initially created, their values were calculated by simply adding up the component stocks' prices and dividing by the number of components. Later, the practice of adjusting the divisor was initiated to smooth out the effects of stock splits and other corporate actions. 

The current divisor values are as follows: DJIA 0.12493117, DJTA 0.22687161 and DJUA 1.46461169.</td>

<td>Hi,

Finding a good and reliable HYIP can be difficult. There are a few things that i look for before i invest. Here's a sample of the things i look for:

Design Of Website

I would not invest with a HYIP if their site did not look professionally designed. The reason for this is that if something looks it was designed in 2 minutes, it will probably disappear in 2 minutes too.

Sustainable Payout Rate

Never invest in something that seems too good to be true. For example, a company offering 200% every day. Payout rates must be sustainable, a company which can offer 200% everyday should not need public money if they can make such spectacular returns by themselves. Some of the more reliable hyips offer around 20% per month. 

HYIP Background Check

I'll also do some background checks before investing. Some of the things i'll ask are:

How Long Have They Been Running For? 
How Are They Sustaining Payout Rates?
Have They Been Paying Out On Time Lately?
Where Are They Based?
Who Is The Admin?

These are just examples of the type of things i look for. If you'd like a list of HYIP's that i am currently investing in, please take a look at my website below.</td>

<td>how does trading oil futures work?</td>
<td>"Futures" are just contracts for a delivery of a certain commodity (oil, in this case) for a "future" delivery. If oil prices never changed, then a oil futures contract would be the base price of oil plus some storage cost and administrative fees.

But this would make for some pretty dull trading and, in fact, oil prices do change -- and sometimes they change a LOT. Like all commodiities, the price is a function of the supply of the commodity v. the demand for that commodity. If supplies are short (e.g. OPEC announces it will cut production by 20%), prices will typically go up. If demand goes down (e.g. Big Oil, Inc. announces it can synthesize oil from old AOL disks, thus making oil as accessible as water), prices for the commodity go down.

A trader may buy an oil futures contract (an agreement on a certain amount of oil at a certain point in the future) in the expectation that the price of oil will rise. If it does, the contract may be worth more. Since the trader doesn't pay the full amount of the contract, but only a small percentage,  the trader has a great deal of leverage and their profits (and losses) are much greater than had they simply bought oil itself. (You can also SELL the commodity first, planning to buy back the contract later when/if the price goes down -- a process known as "shorting".)

All commodities trading is a "zero-sum game". For every dollar won, someone loses a dollar. Futures trading is a truly excellent way to lose money in a stunningly fast manner.</td>

<td>What are the 5 best stocks to buy into???</td>
<td>First, I am among the best investors globally.  My return for the prior five years has been 21% while materially taking less risk than the average risk in the market.  To substantiate this, I also play a stock market game that tracks my return, although it is is a link to a simulation not to my real accounts.  See link: http://www.marketocracy.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Portfolio.woa/ps/FundPublicPage/source=CaHiHdImDlIfEbAoMaKiAbOa

I have also produced an academic paper on the equities markets proving that the assumptions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model and the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model do not occur in nature.  Both are central theories of modern finance.  Both are also always invalid to use.

So now that you have my qualifications, let me begin to answer your question.

First, ignore all of the above posts from others.  They mean well, but neither they nor I know you.

Second, the answer is subjective against your personal goals.  Without knowing your goals, no one can answer these questions.  I no longer provide professional investment advice for a living, but if in the future you need advice I would recommend visiting Edward Jones.  They are good stock brokers.  You will not get the "best" return, but you are likely to reach your personal goals.  Since most people really want to reach their goals, that is more than sufficient.

Second, you cannot invest in something you do not understand.  It isn't investing, it is gambling.

When you purchase stocks, you are buying an ownership interest in a business.  If for example, you purchased 1 share of a public utility with 1,000,000 shares, you would be the owner of one one-millionth of everything that the firm owns or earns.  You are only entitled to receive it when your elected agents, the company's board of directors, authorize it.

I would strongly recommend reading:

"The Intelligent Investor," by Benjamin Graham.

Also, there are a number of investing books for new investors out there.  I personally find that the "Dummies" series is usually pretty good.  If you can take a personal finance class and an accounting class you will also be much better off.  I would also suggest reading wikipedia.  It has a number of decent articles. (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_finance_topics )

For the purposes of satisfying a professor, the best five stocks will be the five stocks you can justify owning.  That means you will need to research the companies directly yourself.  The justification needs to be against whatever goals you are trying to accomplish.  The reason there does not exist five "best stocks," is that there exist multiple "best" lists depending upon your needs.

Bank of America, for example, could be in your list for some goals, but not for others.  Seaboard, could be in your list for some goals as well, but not others.  For example, they kill pigs by electrocution.  If that bothers you ethically, then it is outside your universe, if it doesn't then depending upon other personal constraints it may or may not fit your investing needs.

You need five stocks that you can justify from the basis of your subjective needs.  This includes ethical and emotional needs as well as financial.</td>

<td>how do stocks work and how do i invest?</td>
<td>Stocks represent ownership in a corporation.  When a company goes public, they sell shares to the general public thru an underwriter who sells the shares to large clients.  Once these large clients have the stocks any individual can buy or sell these stocks in the open market -- once you have access to the market.

To get access to the market you need to open up a brokerage account with an investment company.  If you have never bought or sold stocks before I highly recommend that you get your feet wet with mutual funds first -- reading the prospectuses could provide you with some information about what THEY look for when purchasing stocks and bonds.

The stock market is the bets place to have your money for the long term, but you really should leave it to the experts -- funds are a great way to diversify, particularly with limited funds.</td>

If you are talking basic 8 1/2 x 11 papers, you could start out pretty cheap with a good computer program, and a good color laser printer.  If you will do the design and layout the computer program is a must.  If you will have the customer provide camera ready work, then you need to go in a different direction.  Check with your local high school that has graphic arts class, and find out what kind of equipment they use and where they get it from.  They are a HUGE pool of information.  I personally do a LOT of printing work for my local little league and use a micrografx windows draw program with my regualr computer and or laptop, and i have a Hewlett Packard LaserJet 4650 printer.  They are quite pleased and it works well for me.  the ink is expensive and the printer is huge, compared to a desktop model.  It is much less obtrusive than an offset printing press and buckets of bulk ink.  Of course, I work out of my living room and not out of a print shop.

<td>how to compute monthly payment if there is an 18% interest per annum for 4yrs?</td>
<td>I'm trying to do this like a basic math question, so forgive me if I do end up giving you the wrong answer. Firstly, I'm assuming that you're going to pay the deposit payment first right? Plus I hope that DP means deposit payment, because if I'm wrong you can just ignore what I typed below. I also assume that your 18% yearly interest would be divided into 12 months payment. Okay! We start!
First, you minus the deposit payment of 144,000 out of the total price of 720,000, leaving you the balance of 576,000. This was already confirmed in your question. 
Next, you have to deduct the amount you pay for the first year, which is a total of 9,600 x 12 = 115,200. When you deduct 115,200 from 576,000, you get 460,800 left. With me so far? Okay, we'll move on...
Now you have four years left to pay up, so basically you divide the balance of 460,800 between the four years. You'll get 115,200 per year. 
Now remember the 18% interest per year? You'll find that if you apply 18% interest per month, you'll get the same amount as calculated per year. So let's stick to calculating per month, shall we?
Remember the 115,200 you have to pay each year? Now divide that amount by twelve (months) and then times the answer with 118%. Yes, 118%. 
(If you prefer using 18% and then adding that to the month's original payment, that's also fine. But it's the long way round)
Meaning:
(115,200 / 12 ) x (118 / 100) = 11328
So this means that you have to pay 11328 per month (interest already included)for the next four years. Got it?</td>

<td>In stocks what is better, a high or low p/e ratio?</td>
<td>Neither a high nor a low p/e ratio is technically better than another.  Currently, Google is trading at a P/E ratio of 104.94, which is pretty high.  Microsoft is trading at a P/E ratio of 23.1 which is pretty stable, Yahoo is trading at a P/E ratio of 39.18.  

Typically a company will have a higher P/E ratio when the public expects big things in the future, and a lower P/E ratio, when expectations are not as high and their earnings have become more stable. This is certainly not a bad thing at all, this just means that the public is valuing this company like it can depend on their future earnings, it has a lower P/E because people have decided that they feel confident about what the future earnings will be.  

You may have heard the term that a stock is "cheap" right now, and that could be because it is an established company, that has historically traded at a P/E ratio of 25, and then, for seemingly no good reason, it is currently trading at 15.  Many experts think this is the case right now with many big dependable stocks, because they feel people may be over-valuing and expecting too much from many small company stocks.  

So unfortunately there is no short answer, it is relative to other companies in the same industry at the same point in time, and it is relative to the company's prior P/E ratio.  Also, it depends on your risk aversion, a stock with a very high P/E ratio may be more risky than a stock with a lower, and a more dependable, P/E ratio. If they have a high P/E ratio, that means that today's value is based on the fact that the trading public expect big things from this company in the future, and if those big things don't happen (dot.com bust comes to mind) then the stock prices will depreciate as a result of not meeting those high expectations. 

This is not the case every time, and you should always do your research before making investment decisions.  Hope this helps!

This means adding a mere $12,500 a year to whatever the individual is getting from Social Security. Any higher rates of withdrawal and the person runs the very real risk of bleeding the account dry in 10 years or less.

An alternative would be to place some or all of the assets into an immediate annuity. An annuity is a contract issued by an insurance company. When you buy an immediate annuity, you are essentially trading in a lump sum of money for a stream of monthly income that is guaranteed to continue for as long as you are alive.

Your best bet is to meet with a local financial planner (not a life insurance salesman).</td>

<td>Should I invest in a 403B?</td>
<td>The question is would you need to start withdrawing from the 403b when you retire in a few years? While contributing to the 403b would allow you to defer taxes on the income now, you wouldn't have very long to let those savings compound and you wouldn't want to allocate your assets within the 403b very aggresively unless you are able to let the funds sit for several years after retirement.

Remember, also, that you would incur penalties on any withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2 from your 403b. Additionally, many 403b programs use  Tax Sheltered Annuities as the investment chassis. These annuities may have surrender charges assessed on withdrawals during the first several years after investing. 

If you do decide to go ahead with the 403b, make sure you read the prospectus and all related info, especially in regards to withdrawal charges.</td>

AND SO, FIND OUT WHAT IS WORKING IN THE S AND P 500 AS WELL AS THE DOW 30, THEN DO RESEARCH TO FIND WHERE THE DERIVED DEMAND IS. EXAMPLE, ATI , ALLEGANY TECH., THEY ARE BIG INTO TITANIUM WHICH CORRELATES TO THE BOEING ORDERS, ALL METAlS WILL BE BOOMING AS LONG IS BA IS DOING GOOD. CAT IS ALSO PERFORMING WELL. HPQ IS DOING GOOD AND IT IS NO SUPRISE THAT SEAGATE IS DERIVED FROM HPQ OR COMP MANUFACTURERS IN GENERAL. YOU WILL PROBABLY MAKE MORE MONEY OFF THE SMALLER DERIVED COMPANIES LIKE ATI AND SEAGATE, BUT YOU GOT TO KNOW WHY. SEC.GOV IS THE BEST PLACE TO GET REASEARCH ON THE DOW, HENCE, ALL THE PRESS RELEASES GO THERE FIRST. WHEN YOU SEE BA HAS A LESS THAN EXPECTED QUARTER, YOU SELL THE ATI ETC.

ALSO, IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD TECHNICAL INDICATOR THAT THE MAJOR INDEXES ARE AT NEW HIGHS AFTER A FIVE YEAR SPELL. I DON'T SAY ALWAYS W/O PARALLEL. IF YOU LOOK AT HISTORY. THERE HAS RARELY BEEN A TEN YEAR SPAN OF TIME WHERE THE S AND P HASN'T APPRECIATED AN AVERAGE OF TEN PERCENT A YEAR. THE 70'S WERE FAR WORSE THAN 2000 TO NOW IN TERMS OF GEOPOLITICS, OIL, INTEREST RATES, DOOM AND GLOOM, ETC. AND THE INEDEX STILL PULLED OUT A 10% GAIN (AVERAGE FROM 1970 TO 1980). THIS MATTERS, THUS, WE ARE VIRTUALLY FLAT FROM 2000 TO 2006. AND SO, MY THESIS (BASED ON HISTORY) IS THAT 2006 TO 2010 WILL APPRECIATE ENOUGH TO GIVE US A 10% AVERAGE GAIN FROM 2000 TO 2010.</td>

If you don't know how futures work then you should know that when someone asks "whats oil at?" or they tell you what oil is at they are talking about "NYMEX Crude Oil" (there is also "Access Crude Oil") the current price of oil is considered to be the settle(sett) price of the oil closest to delivery. In this case it is Feb 06 Oil (oil futures contracts currently go all the way through Dec 2012)and the sett price is 66.83 (I am useing data from jan 19) so tomorrow on jan 20 you can see at the left bottom corner of the front page of section C in the wall street journal Oil will be 66.83. Because they assume NYMEX Crude Oil of Feb 06 delivery. This assumption is similar to the "Market" assumption. When someone says "Hows the market doing?" they mean the stock market and more specifically they mean the Dow Jones Industrial Average.(even though the S&amp;P500 or better yet the Wilshire 5000 are better indicators of how the stock market in general is doing)</td>

<td>I am interested in investing in stocks as a young beginner what is a good amount to start with?</td>
<td>My suggestion would be not to invest actual money at first, especially if you don't know what you r doing. I think it would be best to start an imaginary account with say 5,10,15 or 20k what ever amount you would actually be willing to invest. then choose stock you think you would invest in, pretend to invest, keep track of the shars you would own and how much your stock would be worth. Then you can test stratigies and when you feel comfortable start to invest actual money.

IF THAT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED IN AND NO MATTER WHAT RIGHT AWAY U WANT TO INVEST REAL MONEY LIKE I DID WHEN I DIDN'T HAVE EXPERIENCE THEN, One fact that you must understand is that the more money you invest with cut's down on your time to profitability (more nessesary if u plan to day trade). Because you make up the money from the commission faster. I would suggest making a relativly secure portfolio maybe 5-10 stock that tend to have a negative correlation(with this approach it would be safe for you to invest as much as you want, your money if diversified correctly can be extremely safe), then mess around with buying and selling 1 additional stock, if you were looking to do the whole day trading thing. so that is 5-10 diversifed long term position and then have always one shart term position. The shart term position is where all the market risk comes in but it is also where all the fun comes in. Remember never do anything you feel uncomfortable with and hold a short term position would be suggested only if you feel comfortable and up to it, if you are not up to it don't do it. (another fact you might want to know is that long term means over a year and gains made on stock held over a year are only taxable at 15% short term gains are taxable in your current tax bracket)

Their rates are variable, so it may go back to the 3.8% that it was prior to the promotion, or it may be higher than that. Please read the note terms carefully, as it's only on 'new deposits.' For instance, if I put $200 in my account, it all earns the promotional rate. But if I withdraw $100, and then the next day I deposit that $100 back into the account, I'm now only earning the promotional rate on $100.

The REIT is a corporate form that is principally in the business of originating or buying mortgages and making money on the difference between what they borrow money for and what they earn on the mortgages.

Overly Simple Example: A Mortgage REIT raises capital by issuing MBS that pay 4% interest. The Mortgage REIT takes that money and lends it to mortgage borrowers at 6%. The REIT keeps the difference or 2%.</td>

Since the growth of assets within a qualified plan account are not taxed from year to year, you would loose the tax exempt benefit of munis. Since the other three choices are not tax exempt they would be appropriate options to include in a qualified plan offering.</td>

<td>Share price has absolutly no importance in stock buying decision. (unless looking to write options with limited amount of money). A company could be worth $100 and it does not matter if it has two shares of 50 dollars each, or 100 shares of $1 each. RHAT is worth 5 billion dollars and MSFT is 286 billion dollars As for Rhat VS. MSFT, it is important to see the value of one share of MSFT, and RHAT.  and MSFT is expected to make just less of 1.5 per share next year and RHAT is to make less than 40 cents. The investors are expecting RHAT to have extremely high growth. Rhat is at a future PE of 75, which is very high and very risky, any small news of faltered growth will kill this stock, so even if Earnings per share double next year (not expected by estimaters) they would have a PE of 35 which is average for the industry and no guarantee that it would be higher than that is the excitement goes up. Looking at the cashflow of RHAT which is horrible due to their need of research, and only fairly good debt. This stock is extremely risky and holds limited upside. I don't like large caps, but in this case, it is better than this small cap, and there are plenty of other small caps with far less risk and higher potential than RHAT, BUT, if you are looking for long term investments, and you honestly believe that RHAt will rattle Microsoft and steal a big piece of it's market share in the coming decade, then hold on to it. a 30% short term loss, is not too bad if it's market cap reaches 50 Billion for a 1000% gain in less than ten years.

<td>Where can I find a place to invest as little as 100 dollars and start a retirement fund.?</td>
<td>You have very limited choices at this point. I can suggest that you start with getting some I Bonds. They are bonds issued by the US govt that have a fixed portion set for the 6months you buy it in and a floating rate portion which increases with increasing inflation. You will never lose buying power with this.

You can buy them directly from the Treasury and there is no transaction fee. The minimum is $50 for paper certificates and $25 for electronic purchases.

Once your balance increases to $3000 or above you can sell these (after atleast 1 years of holding, and 5 years if you do not want any penalty) and buy the TotalStockMarketIndex fund from Vanguard.

Buying mutual funds directly from the fund company is the cheapest way to invest. Do not use brokers.

An alternate place to put your money is a savings account with ING. All new accounts get 4.35% interest rate which is the best as far as I know.</td>

<td>Is there a difference between a 401k and a 403b?</td>
<td>I agree somewhat with "melvin", BUT a company offering a 401k normally deposits money into the account of it's employees based on a percentage of their individual contributions.  For example, an employee elects to withhold 5% from each paycheck.  His employer matches the first 3% dollar for dollar, and then they pay 50 cents on the dollar for the next 2%, not to exceed 5% total contribution from the employer.
On the other hand, traditionally, a 403b is a retirement account whereby an employee deposits his own money through payroll deductions.  The account is an interest-drawing account, with no contribution from the employer.
Both the 401k &amp; 403b are retirement accounts, and they are both important to anyone planning for the future.  One can transfer the balance of a 401k to a 403b or vice-versa.
You may also want to look into mutual funds, annuities, IRA &amp; Roth IRA's, CD's, stocks and a handful of other types of retirement-oriented investment strategies.  Best of luck to you.</td>

It's the law of supply and demand.  Very few individuals know how to run big companies, so the ones that are around get big salaries.

Try this.  Offer your services as a CEO to the board of a giant public company free of charge.  Would they accept your offer?  Even for free?  Why not?

It may be your opinion to tie CEO salaries to profit or stock performance, but that's not likely the opinion of most CEO's, is it?  When they draw up the contracts, the CEO's would refuse to sign such things because it's not fair.  Any unplanned catastrophic event that destroys profits or stock performance will destroy their personal salaries.

<td>Stocks Question?</td>
<td>Stocks are fractional ownership claims on a company.  An owner of 100 shares of IBM owns 100/1,580,000,000th of the company.  That owner can vote at annual and special meetings of shareholders.  That owner is entitled to proportionate receipt of dividends.  That owner is entitled to his/her proportionate interest in the event IBM would decide to disolve itself.

The market price moves with supply and demand changes.  When you place an order for an exchange traded stock (stocks trading on an organized exchange, but not the NASDAQ) you are sending an order to buy or sell shares in a company.  Broadly speaking there are two category of orders (other categories relate to triggers to trades or special instructions on filling the order) they are market orders and limit orders.

When you enter a market order to buy, you tell your broker to send someone to the floor of the exchange and to continue bidding until you are the high bidder and get the shares.  There is no limit to what you will pay.  As a practical matter, it is usually near the last price.  A limit order instructs your broker to go to the floor and bid any amount up to your limit.  If the highest bid is above your price, your order will not fill.  Some limit orders are allowed to remain at the floor auction for up to a month (a good til cancelled order).

If you own shares, say of IBM, and you put in a market sell order, you are instructing your broker to send someone to the floor of the exchange and accept any price to get your shares sold and to continue to bid down your shares until someone buys thems.  Like the above limit order, if you place a limit then you are informing the broker that you want to sell, but will not accept below a certain price.

The NASDAQ works a little differently.  They were originally stores (just like JCPenney).  You came in and they sold stocks to you over the counter, or bought stocks from you over the counter.  Stocks traded on the NASDAQ do not match buyers with sellers.  When you buy a stock on the NASDAQ, the computer looks at the prices each different broker (called a market maker) and gets you the best price.  The same is true when you sell.  The market maker takes the stocks into inventory or sells them from their inventory.  It really does work much like a store, although highly traded stocks have such high volume that the market makers are really matching orders like the exchanges do.  The only difference is that market makers on the NASDAQ are required to accept ALL market orders at the last stated price.  The exchange only have to accept matching orders, although market makers do exist on the exchanges (called specialists).

There is one other issue not mentioned, cash accounts versus margin accounts.  In cash accounts, you own your shares but in order to make a purchase or sell you have to have sufficient cash in your account to buy and sufficient shares in your account to sell.  There can be time delays since it can take three days for orders to clear from one owner to the other.  Conceptually, it is just like check clearing, it can take time.

The other account is a margin account.  In a margin account, you can borrow money to purchase shares beyond the money you have available, up to a limit.  This adds risk because you are buying more than you can immediately pay for.  As an example, if you had $81,630 you could buy 1000 shares of IBM in a cash account or 2000 shares in a margin account.  If IBM's price went to $100 per share you would own $200,000 worth of stock and owe $81,630 plus interest.  You could sell, get approximately $120,000 on your $81,630 investment instead of $100,000 on your initial investment.  The reverse is true as well.  If the price fell to $60, you would have $120,000 but still owe $81,630.  Instead of having $60,000 for a loss of approximately $20,000, you would have slightly less than $40,000.

Now that is one side of margin.  The other side allows you to sell things you do not own. </td>

<td>How much (percent)  of my income should I invest in my 401K? I just graduated college and I'm sadly ignorant.</td>
<td>First, congratulations on starting to save for your retirement.  The benefits will be amazing.

The trick is time.  The longer you contribute, the more dramatically your balance will increase.  Contribution-wise, I believe your contributions are limited to no more than 16% of your gross income.  Obviously, contribute as much as you can without it cutting into your debt and living expenses.  One great thing about 401K contributions is that they are deducted pre-tax. That means you don't pay taxes on whatever you contribute until you withdraw it.  You'll find your net pay won't go down by the same amount as your contribution.  If you're in a higher tax bracket (like single), it'll have an even smaller effect.  It's almost like contributing for free!

As for investing, I think the trick is to pick a balance of funds based on your investement goals.  As a young person, you're much more interested in growth--increasing the value of your balance--than you are income--low-return but safe investments like bonds.  So a good strategy is to put a larger percentage of your contributions into funds that are growth-oriented, like the Growth Funds you've listed.  These have a higher risk short-term, but since you're investing long-term they tend to give you better returns overall.  Plus remember this sage investment advice: no risk, no reward.  The more you're willing to stick out your neck, the more you'll get back.

I'd consider a strategy using 60-80% of contributions in growth funds, with a small percentage of that in a higher-risk fund, and 20-40% in income or money funds.  Just remember that you can change the percentages of future contributions pretty much at will depending on the kind of plan your employer has.

You should also check to see if the plan provider (Merrill Lynch, etc.) has some pre-configured investment models.  You can then rely more on their professional direction to help you better plan.

Good luck--first one to a million wins!</td>

<td>You are doing one of two things: 
a) Agreeing to buy a certain commodity on a certain date at a certain price; or 
b) Agreeing to sell a certain commodity one a certain date at a certain price.

Don't worry, you don't have to actually take posession of them.  

Farmers use them to spread their risk (they can lock in a price for part of their crop).  Processors use them to spread their risk (they lock in a price to buy a certain amount of crops).  Speculators might aquire the rights to buy the crops at certain price assuming the market rate on that date will be higher -- they get to pocket the difference after fees.  Or they might aquire the right to sell crops on a certain date for a certain value hoping the market will be lower.  Again, pocket the difference.

It is sort of like stocks but instead of a percentage share of a company's equity, you own the right to buy a crop for a predetermined price.

The laws governing futures permit and expect insider trading.  That is the reason that when Hilary Clinton invested $1000 in pork bellies and walked out with $100,000 a year later no one could do anything about it.  As a governor's wife she was not violating the law to have trades placed that were set up to win.  If you are not rich, or the spouse of a governor, expect to be taken advantage of.</td>

<td>How can I invest $6,000.00 to earn the highest interest?</td>
<td>It depends on how long you can leave your money invested. The higher the returns you seek, the more risk of short term losses you are going to need to accept. If you do not have a long time to stay invested you need to pick more conservative investments. Over the long term, the highest returns are earned by stocks, with small company stocks edging out larger company stocks. Bonds will typically give you lower rates of return than stocks, but less unpredictability. CD's and money markets are at the low end return-wise, but have virtually no chance to losing value.

Seek the advice of a financial planner. Have him/her help you complete a Risk Tolerance Analysis. The results of this analysis will guide you to the proper mix of assets for your particular savings goal.</td>

<td>How safe is it to put money into a money market account?</td>
<td>Money Market Accounts are very safe.

Many money market accounts place restrictions on the amount of transactions you can make in a month (such as five or less). Furthermore, you usually have to maintain a certain balance in the account to receive the higher rate of interest. Some banks require at least $500, others require a much higher balance.

What Is a Money Market Fund?
In short, it is a mutual fund that invests solely in money market instruments. Just like a mutual fund, it issues redeemable units to investors and must follow guidelines set out by the SEC. A money market fund's net asset value (NAV) is also determined at the end of each day.

Money market funds, however, are completely different from money market accounts and money market instruments. Money market accounts are basically special kinds of savings accounts that you can open at any local bank, and a money market instrument is a form of highly-liquid short-term debt security. Furthermore, unlike a bank account, returns from money market funds are not guaranteed even though they are lower risk. Their stability rests solely upon the investments that make up their portfolios and it is possible for the fund to lose money, although the odds of this occurring are rare.</td>

<td>How &amp; when does a mutual fund gives returns? Explain with example?</td>
<td>There are actuall 3 ways for a mutual fund to pay a return. 
1. Capital Gains would be paid when a mutual fund manager decides to close out a position in a specific stock that fund owes. Now if the stock is sold for a premium (above cost of what it was bought for) they will get money back to distribute to the shareholders. Ex. Manger bought 100shares of Coke for 23.00 sold for 25.00 has capital gains of 200.00 
2. Dividends are the second way. When a stock that the fund owes pays a divdend it can be paid back to the shareholders of the fund. Ex. coke declares a 5 cent dividend per share. For every share the fund owns they will receive 5 cents. Now if the fund owns bonds rather than stocks whenver they receive interest payments from that bond they will pay a dividend.
3 Is to sell your mutual funds. If you sell higher than what you bought for you gain money. Simple enough.

As far as when do they acutally pay out returns like in 1 and 2. Not exactly possible to say. Since the return on these investments are guaranteed you aren't always going to get a return. Say you do a mutual fund company is required under the investment company act of 1940 to pay out income atleast annually. Usually at the end of the year. They will however usually pay dividends quarterly if there are any and capital gains are usually annually to semi-annually.</td>

The only downside to using a roth is losing the tax advantages. You will have to pay ordinary imcome tax on any earnings. I would recommend using the roth exclusively until you can at least max it out. When you get to that point use the 529. I am an advisor and even the wholesalers that come to talk recommend the roth over the 529 if you cant fund it significantly.

extra info: 
The Roth was created for retirment planning however it does offer penalty free withdrawals for qualified education expenses. Investments will grow tax deferred just like 529 but will be taxable when withdrawn if used for school.</td>

<td>Anyone know a reputable company selling the Iraq Dinar? Many look dodgy.?</td>
<td>No, there are NO reputable companies selling the Iraqi dinar with the possible exception of a few coin dealers who are trading it as a collectors item and not as a currency. 

The Iraqi dinar has no value outside of Iraq, Jordan, or Kuwait. The price is essentially fixed at 1476 dinars to the US dollar. Since you are using the term 'dodgy' I suspect you may not be American. In the case of other currencies the value fluctuates according the exchange differences between the US dollar and that currency. Presently the pound is 2575 dinars to the pound. 

Why would you want to buy a currency that is likely to end up with a fixed value relative to the US dollar? The value so far has never changed more than 1%. 
If the dinar ends up tied to the dollar, as many currencies are, then you might as well invest in US dollars, and at least have something that is liquid outside of Baghdad.

It is unlikely the dinar will be allowed to trade on the free market anytime soon, if ever. I suspect that if it were floated it would drop precipitously similar to the Turkish lira that reached millions of lira to the dollar until recently revalued.

Are you prepared to take a vacation to Baghdad to spend your dinars?

<td>I'm a professional trader and please don't use "invest" and trading" in the same sentence! They have totally different goals - investment is for those who want a passive outlook - hold for the long term is their motto. Traders participate in intraday trading.

Don't trade with money you can't afford to lose.

Have an exit plan before you put in a trade.

Intra day is a deadly business - you need to be at least 51% correct to be able to make a profit - don't expect every trade to go your way.

In forex trading you've got 24 hours to trade the markets - in stock markets you only have 6 to 8 hours a day to trade and some stocks don't offer the volatility that would allow you to exit a trade profitably within the day.

The ultimate tip is to trade with the trend - there are certainly profits to be made by a higher risk is involved.</td>

<td>what is private equity ? how is it different from venture capital business?</td>
<td>Jeremy J has the right answer. I would only add that Private Equity investors typically play a larger role in managing the company. Because of the large dollars at stake, they take more control of day-day operations in a downturn scenario. Also, the exit options for a Private Equity investment are different from a traditional VC. Since most PE deals are already public companies, PE investors may not have an IPO option to exit the investment. Having said that, it is common for a PE investor to sell (unload) its stake in a company to another PE investor with no additional capital infusion into the company. Another exit option for PE is to split the company and sell the parts for more than the value of the entire company. In some cases, PE firms only invest for this possible outcome. VC's typically don't have this option since the assets of smaller company or a startup is generally not worth more than the value of the entire company.</td>

I would never risk more than 1% of my entire portfolio on an option position.

<td>what is the definition of p/e ratio?</td>
<td>In finance, the P/E ratio of a stock (also called its "earnings multiple", or simply "multiple" or "PE") is used to measure how cheap or expensive share prices are. It is probably the single most consistent red flag to excessive optimism and over-investment. It also serves, regularly, as a marker of business problems and opportunities. By relating price and earnings per share for a company, one can analyze the market's valuation of a company's shares relative to the wealth the company is actually creating.

The PE is calculated primarily for common shares, not for preferred shares. The appropriate calculation for preferreds is the preferred dividend coverage ratio.

A related concept is the "PEG ratio". This is the PE ratio adjusted by a growth coefficient. It is sometimes used in high growth industries and new ventures. Its use is controversial.

Another practice, which is not mainstream, based on behavioral finance, is to take market behavior parameters, among which the stock image, as factors playing a part in the level and evolution of the PE.

The PE can be applied not only to shares, but to other assets also. Thus the PE, comparing Price to Rental Incoming for housing is an important measure in the analysis of the existence or not of Property_bubbles.</td>

<td>As an example, let's just say that you own 1% of the outstanding stock of a given company. What does this mean?

You theoretically own 1% of the company. Everything the company owns: money in the bank, buildings, computers, patents, inventory, mines, company cars, accounts receivable - everything. This also means that you own 1% of their liabilities: loans, bonds, accounts payable, royalties.

It goes beyond that of course, otherwise stocks would just trade for the value of the company divided by the number of shares (known as book value per share). You also own 1% of their future profits. Now, they don't simply write you a check as they make these profits - the company's management has an obligation to use this money to **your** best benefit as a shareholder. If they believe that this money would be best used in expanding the business, or buying up a competitor, or increasing advertising, that is what they should do. If they think paying down debt is in your best interests, that is what they should do. If the company is mature, big and without much in the way of growth prospects, the money is returned to shareholders in the form of dividends. All of these things are risky to a certain extent, and it is difficult to determine how it is going to change the value of the company in the future. That
is why you get so many different opinions of a given stock's value.

This, in a nutshell, is what you are buying. I hope that it clears things up.

Jetblue and Southwest were the only airlines making money while oil prices were rising.  But with recent quarterly reports indicates that even Jetblue is in the red.  Southwest will continue to make money for another three to four years.  They had the forsight to prepay for their fuel in advance of the prices increase.  Southwest and its CEO is known for thinking "outside the box".  This time, they make a bundle on this thinking.

The recent bankruptcy of major airlines has made the situation worse.  It protected airlines from failing and maintained capacity.  The excess capacity is keeping prices low and with the increases in fuel cost is not a good combination for the industry.

Jetblue is a very good airline.  They will have to last long enough until capacity starts to fall and be able to increase prices.</td>

<td>Does anyone have any good stock purchase ideas - somewhere in the $10-20 or so range?</td>
<td>A few companies that I would recommend you look into are BRNC, INSP, and YHOO.  While these don't quite fall in the $10-$20 range that you specified, this shouldn't matter, a 10% gain is a 10% gain no matter how many shares you own.  

BRNC operates in the oilfield drilling industry, and are expected to see growth rates of over 35% annually for the next few years.  From their current levels, I see a 80% upside within the next year.

INSP operates in the search and mobile phone service industries.  While their growth rates in their mobile initiatives may be enough to warrant a buy, I am attracted to this stock by their cash position.  They have over half of their market cap in cash, and no debt on hand.  They are a growth company currently trading at value stock type levels.  Should result in  nice gain if you invest at these levels.

Last but not least in YHOO.  You are using one of their newer offerings at the moment, just one of the many facets that will contribute to their future growth.  Forget Google, Yahoo! is the king of the internet sector.  While I see Google's shares falling over the next 12 months, I see Yahoo gaining nicely.  I'm not going to talk in terms of 12 months for Yahoo though, as they are a company that I view as a leftime investment.  Their is absolutely no reason that Yahoo should not remain the leading internet presence 20 years from today.

<td>Is it better to invest in a condo or home in Myrtle Beach, SC?</td>
<td>Depends on the condo project. Not all condo projects are created equal.

First, do a cash flow analysis on each using comps in the area.

Second, evaluate the condo project itself. Consider the % of investors in the project, health of the condo assoc, age of the development (needing repairs in common areas etc.), and condo developers role (if any) still in the project. It's good to have the homeowners in complete control - especially when some work is left to do.

Once you get comfortable on the condo project, pick the one with the better cash flow.</td>

<td>The Market?</td>
<td>In general, bad news effects the market adversely. If Wall Street thinks Hamas taking over the Palestinian Authority will lead to increased terror attacks, the market will take a general downturn. How big or how little a downturn is almost unpredictable, though.

If you are one who thinks that the market will take a downturn, don't get out of it, however. Look into companies that provide security or develop weapons to invest in. Money can be made in EVERY market - if you interpret world events correctly and make wise investment choices.

My own personal opinion: I definitely don't think Wall Street will like it at all especially with the Iranians now taking the helm at fundraising for Hamas. The last thing any security conscious person want is Iran handing over tens of millions of dollars - each one with a string attached - over to a known terrorist organization.</td>

1. Save up $1000 and make one good trade at a time. Don't worry about being left behind. Check out how William O'Neil trades, how Gary Kaltbaum trades, how Warren Buffett trades.

2. Put it in mutual funds.

3. Buy a single call option on awesome companies. Read William J. O'Neil's How to Make Money in Stocks. This is the most risky proposition of the three. Highest possible pay off too. You seem to like risk though! :-) Just keep in mind, if they're out of the money when they expire, they go to zero!

<td>should i get a lawyer before settling my work comp lump sum settlement?</td>
<td>Yes, if you were offered a settlement already the lawyer is only entitled to 20 percent of anything extra they offer you.  Also he is only entitled to 20 percent of disputed medical charges.  For instance lets say you were offered 20,000.  If you get a lawyer and he gets your settlement to 30,000 you would only owe him 30,000 minus 20,000 times 20 percent or 2,000.  If he can't get them to pay more than 20,000 then you would owe him nothing.

Get the settlement offer in writing and then go to an attorney.  He will not take your case unless he thinks he can get more than the  settlement offer.

Also remember that work comp money is tax free.  Also, they owe you any back TTD, and any future lost wages (there is a cap on that amount).</td>

You will pay the tax on these when you file your 2005 tax returns by April 17.  For federal tax, there is a special rate for dividends and for long term (held more than 1 year) capital gains.  It is 10 or 15 % depending on your tax bracket.  You should complete schedule D of the 1040 tax form.  There is no special treatment for capital gains in Minnesota, so the gains will be taxed as normal income (typically 7.05%, but up to 7.85% if your income is over $100,000).  You will get a 1099-B and/or 1099-Div statement from your broker.  In the unlikely event that they withheld tax (which they would only do if the IRS has notified you that you are subject to backup withholding) it will show on the 1099-B.</td>

don't know where you are located, but i would proceed with caution. the buildings across the street could overshadow your intended purchase and make your property worth less to a potential buyer down the road. i would never buy across the street from unknown construction. what happens if they don't finish the project and leave a shell across the street that scares people away. what if they build something that is ugly, or creates traffic problems. 

did you check out how many town house units are owner occupied or rented to others? that is a major factor. renters don't treat the property the way an owner does.

Some good places online to share info with others and learn are;

investorshub.com (my favorite)
siliconinvestor.com
ragingbull.com

many boards are devoted to trading at the above sites. you can sign up for free memberships at all 3. Ask the traders on the trading boards what software they use.

I have been a trader, investor, broker, etc. and it is rare to see anyone who is not a professional trade for a living. If you got it, then you will know pretty soon. You have to be able to set your stops, take your losses if needed.

<td>Everything depends on your goals &amp; your current asset allocation (or anticpated asset allocation). Typical discount brokers (Schwab, Scottrade, Fidelity, Ameritrade, etc are available from $7.00 a trade to $12.95 a trade.

Your question leads me to believe that you're new to buying shares.

Scottrade is a "deep" discount brooker. I have an account with them &amp; I'm very happy. BUT DON'T USE A "DEEP DISCOUNT" BROOKER IF YOU'RE NEW TO BUYING STOCKS (the money you lose may far out weigh the savings).

You should have a good understanding of Stocks, DRIP's, Stock Funds &amp; ETF's before you trade. You should have a good understanding of "asset allocation" before you start to buy.

<td>what is the value of the Iraqi dinar? who decides this value?</td>
<td>It has no value outside of Iraq, Jordan or Kuwait. 

The current exchange rate is 1476 dinars to the dollar in daily auctions held by the Bank of Iraq. This value has remained essentially unchanged since the Coalition began exchanging currency to enable large contractors to pay Iraqi subcontractors. The value is officially decided by the Bank of Iraq, but since there has been no change over the last couple of years, it appears the US government may be the ultimate influence on that value. 

Recently the Bank of Iraq  began exchanging dinars for banks in Jordan and Kuwait, again because there are so many contractors in these areas that are working in Iraq it was necessary for business. 

It will not surprise me if the Iraqi dinar is eventually tied to the US dollar and not allowed to float. My own assessment of the dinar is that if allowed to float, it would sink precipitously. I believe it would likely follow the path of the Turkish lira, which reached millions of lira to the dollar before it was recently revalued. 

To answer some of your other questions, no I would not buy it. You will probably have to take a vacation to Baghdad to redeem your dinars. I do not see potential recovery of the Iraqi economy or oil production in less than a decade and maybe much longer. Currently Iraq is barely able to produce more oil than is consumed inside the country and has not reached it prewar production levels. It will take many years before Iraq is able to realize the potential of its oil reserves, and if the dinar is tied to the dollar, there is no chance that you will make any money (assuming you hope to exchange for dollars). You would be better off buying Euros or Swiss Francs, as those are more likely to be the haven of Iraqi wealth in the future.

<td>what is study of portfolio management on optimization shrpe's index?</td>
<td>Portfolio Management is about getting the set of assets with the maximum reward (return) with the lowest uncertainty (volatily). It's obvious that, since portfolio management has to do with the future, no one is going to get it 100% right all the time.
This opens the question: can I have  some assurance that a manager is better than others? 
It can be easily shown (See Sharpe, Investments ISBN: 0130101303 or  Fama, Foundations of Finance: Portfolio Decisions and Securities Prices ISBN: 0465024998 ) that riskier assets yield larger returns. Then a manager can outperform over time just by incurring into more risk. But that is not the manager's merit. It's just that he is taking more risk (That also means that he/she can have sharper downturns).
So, the Sharpe Ratio is a measure of how much a manager is really over/under performing wiht respect to the risk he is incurring:

S=Excess Return / Excess Vol.
Where Excess Return is the difference between the return obtained and the risk-free rate, and the excess volatility is the standard deviation of the excess return.
Then , A Sharpe Ratio of 1 means that the manager is obtaining the return predicted bye the risk incurred, while a Sharpe Ratio larger (smaller) than 1 means that the manager is over(under)performing.

However, risk-prone investors (like young proffesionals) might be willing to accept lower sharpe ratios on exchange for higher absolute returns (That is, more returns, no matter that they are more volatile), while risk-averse investors most probably feel more confortable with higher Sharpe Ratios only when that means less volatility ON SPITE of lower returns.
Then, for choosing a manager, one should aproach the manager whose WEALTH UTILITY FUNCTION (or RISK PREFERENCE) is closer to one's.</td>

February 09, 2006 14:10 IST

The last quarter of the financial year is devoted to an activity, which perhaps is as important as any annual ritual. Yes, we are talking about tax planning; an activity on which most investors spend very little time. Most of us simply invest in line with what we have been doing over the past.

But this year, things are going to be different. A lot more time will have to be dedicated to the tax-planning exercise. And rightly so, because there is a lot more at stake! To put it another way, there is a lot more for you to gain this year!

Until the previous year, tax benefits related to investments in select instruments were defined under Section 88 of the Income Tax Act. Under Section 88, individuals could benefit from a 'rebate' on an investment amount that could not exceed Rs 100,000.</td>

<td>what do you know about the iraqi new dinar,can you name a bank or safe place to buy the new dinars?</td>
<td>Why would you buy a currency that has no value outside of Iraq?

At present the value of the dinar appears to be fixed by the Coalition government and the Central Bank of Iraq. Its value of 1477 dinars to 1 US dollar has not changed more than 1% since the exchange was opened by the Coalition government a couple of years ago. It is not a freely traded currency and is unlikely to become one anytime soon. There is a significant need for foreign contractors to exchange US dollars for Iraqi dinars in order to pay Iraqi subcontractors and the stable exchange rate is needed to protect that. I understand that both Jordanian and Kuwiati banks are participating in the exchange in Iraq, but this again is only to service those contractors that need  to convert currency. The dinar essentially has no value outside of Iraq. If you want to buy dinars on the internet, keep in mind that you may have to take a vacation to Baghdad in order to redeem for anything of value. 

There is no 'safe' place to buy Iraqi dinars if you consider the safety of your investment to be important. Buying dinars is pure speculation and most of the vendors I have seen selling them are making several hundred percent profits fleecing uninformed buyers.

It is unlikely that the value of the dinar will be allowed to float on the foreign exchange markets anytime soon. It will probably continue to be a fixed exchange rate for as long as the US government is the major beneficiary of the Iraqi government, and when that no longer takes place Iraqi currency is just as likely to fall dramatically in value as it is to rise. Oil production in Iraq has not reached pre-war levels and current production barely offsets domestic consumption. Current exports are being offset by imports of refined oil products. It will be ten or more years before oil production in Iraq is a significant support for the Iraqi economy because that is how long it will take oil companies to develop the Iraqi oil fields, and repair the damage caused by the war.

<td>what investment can you do withn1 MILLION THAT GUANRANTY RETURN OF n50,000 A MONTH?</td>
<td>There are many investments that you can make with $1,000,000.00 USD that return at least 60% anually. Howevever, most businesses take some time to become profitable. For example if you start a small restaurant chain in 10 cities with $100,000.00 for each location. You start selling from the very first day you open the restaurant (Hopefully) and asuming you make 50% on every meal served (Unlikely) and asuming you sell on average $20 per customer to 10 customers each day it would take 1000 days just to get your initial investment back. After that, you will get at least a 60% anual return on your investment asuming you increase your customer sales to over $20 per customer and your daily customers to over 10 each day. You should take into account that at least 1 location may go out of business. This is equivalent to over $50,000.00 a month. However, like any business there will be months with low sales and months with high sales. Eventually your place will be known and asuming you have a good marketing campaign and an excellent manager running your business you could easily get over $50,000 every month. But that would take time. Of course there is not way to know if your restaurnat will be successfull or if you go out of business. The same goes for every kind of business. It may work or it may fail. Another approach would be to invest in the stock market but unless you have an excellent portfolio manager (I mean world class and very expensive Portfolio Manager) is is unlikely you get returns higher than 60% per year. There are many portfolio managers out there that can easily manage your money and get you over 60% per year but your ammount is so small that even if you pay them $300,000 a year of salary you won't make the amounts you want. A $150,000 a year portfolio manager may not get you a 60% return on your investment. And of course there is always the more popular brands that can manage your wealth for a very small fee (Less than 5% of your assets) but they will not give you the returns you want.
Keep in mind, you may have to pay taxes on your business too.
In the end, if you want to make a 60% return on your investment you need to TAKE VERY HIGH RISKS and you could lose money. On the other hand you can get safe 10% return on your investment buying Bonds with VERY LITTLE RISK but that is a long way from $50,000 a month. 
There is no such thing as HIGH RETURN LOW RISK

<td>what value does a stock have, after the company goes bankrupt (united airlines)?</td>
<td>With UAL, the stock was deleted, but that is not always the case.  It depends on the balance sheet of the company and how many creditors they have.  Keep in mind that the common stock is the lowest rung on the ladder.  When a company files for chapter 11 (reorganization), they have to negotiate with all of their creditors (the higher rungs on the ladder).  Once the bankruptcy court approves the plan, if there are any assets left they will go to the common stock holder.  In a lot of these situations, the common stock holder is then issued new shares in the new reorganized company.  Usually they do not recieve 1 to 1 for their shares.  It's usually a fractional amount like 1 share for every 50 that you previously owned.  This is why it is a bad idea to try to speculate on stocks of companies in bankruptcy.</td>

<td>The opportunity that you will do worse than the expected return?</td>
<td>for question 1 is the return 8.242% per year? I would guess yes, so you would multiply 1.08242 to the 30th power times 10000. 

What you are doing here is to multiply 10,000 times 1.08242, (add the one to keep the 10000 plus interest, if you dont add the one you are only calculating the interest and have to add back in the 10000) to get how much at the end of year one, then multiply that result by 1.08242 to get what you have at end of year 2. Then keep doing that until at the end of year 30.

The second question is a bit more difficult. Take that spreadsheet and fill in the values at the top. make your begining value 10000 and the annual payment 0. Not sure what value to use for confidence (I am sure you know what to use here) and the other two were given return = 8%, deviation=10%. After 30 years you will have a lower and an upper limit. 

You then take answer from #1 and find out how far into the range it is to find the percent liklihood. For example if the lower limit was 100 and the upper limit was 300 and your number calculate in #1 was 150, then you can see that 150 is greater than 25% of the possibilities and less than 75%. So you would do worse 25% of the time.

The actual calulation would be:
U = Upper limit
L = lower limit
R = range = U - L
C = compared value = answer from #1

percent worse = (C-L)/R

in the example percent worse = (150-100)/(300-100)</td>

<td>is it a bad idea to invest alot of money in us saveings bonds to retire?</td>
<td>As stated, it depends on your age and your tolerance for risk. Savings bonds are guaranteed by the US Government, but only return about 4-6% per year, depending on the bond type. There are very safe mutual funds that allow you to invest over time (like bonds), but that will return a better percentage than savings bonds, which are the most conservative. Even mature people should not be investing "large" amounts of money in savings bonds, because there is a holding period. If you take the money out too soon, you pay a penalty (lose interest). Plus the returns are not that great.

Lastly, expecting that savings bonds will create the money you WILL need in retirement is unrealistic. You need to fund a 401(k) where you work, buy some stocks and mutual funds, then you can add some bonds. Diversification is the secret.</td>

If substantial, you will want to ladder a bond portfolio ( to mitigate the effects of rising rates while providing income), use municipals if the account is non-qualified. If your assets are not that large, bond funds will do.

Supplement the bond holdings with some core equity mutual funds like Capital Income Builder, or even select ETF's.

Depending on your age and risk tolerance, an immediate annuity is another option.

<td>You say you've been trading for five years? I assume you've been trading full capital/fully funded positions?

You can be creative about raising and borrowing more capital by using leveraged financial instruments.

Some of these instruments expose you to the security proce movements while only having to put only 1% or 10% collateral down. Of course, increased leverage means increased risk and increased profits or losses.

Depending on where you are in the world, some of these are not legal: say CFDs are not legal in USA but legal in Australia and UK. Options are an alternative for this instrument in the USA. There are also warrants and forex - foreign exchange (forex). Forex allows you to put  only 1% down collateral.

<td>In Excel, what is the function or formula for calculating annualized return for an investment?</td>
<td>Calculate a compound annual growth rate (CAGR)   

A compound annual growth rate (CAGR) measures the rate of return for an investment — such as a mutual fund or bond — over an investment period, such as 5 or 10 years. The CAGR is also called a "smoothed" rate of return because it measures the growth of an investment as if it had grown at a steady rate on an annually compounded basis. To calculate a CAGR, use the XIRR function.


If the XIRR function is not available and returns the #NAME? error, install and load the Analysis ToolPak add-in.

How?

On the Tools menu, click Add-Ins. 
In the Add-Ins available list, select the Analysis ToolPak check box, and then click OK. 
If necessary, follow the instructions in the setup program.

<td>Futures are standardized contracts trading on exchanges betweem two parties known as counterparties. They specify a price and quanitiy of an underlying asset for delivery on the expiry date.

Options are contracts specifying the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell an underlying asset at a set price (the strike price) until a specified date, the expiry date.

Both types of contracts are generally not suitable for individual investors.

In other words there isnt a physical place, a building like the New York Stock Exchange.  The number you see quoted is a composite of around 5,000 stocks traded on the computerized system.

The S&amp;P 500 is an index of 500 stocks. It is 500 of the most widely held U.S.-based common stocks, chosen by the S&amp;P Index Committee for market size, liquidity, and sector representation.  The only reason a company is deleted from the index is if it goes bankrupt or it merges with another company.  The S&amp;P 500 accounts for 70 percent of all capitalization of the US equity markets

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a price-weighted average of 30  stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.  The average consists of 30 of the largest and most widely held public companies in the United States. The Dow Jones averages are computed by summing the prices of the stocks in the average and then dividing by a constant called the divisor. The divisor for the Dow Jones Industrial Average is adjusted periodically to reflect splits in the stocks making up the average.  Since it is price weighted a $1 increase in a lower-priced stock can be negated by a $1 decrease in a  higher-priced stock, even though the lower priced stock had a larger percentage change</td>

Last, areas like Faubourg Marigny and Bywater had little to no flooding but may still have good deals available.

<td>I'm a single mom....whats the best way to save money when you don't make that much to begin with?</td>
<td>Saving is not about Big Numbers. It isn't even about Little Numbers Across A Long Time. It is about Consistent Numbers Across Any Time.

Saving money certainly involves "not buying stuff." But this view is far too narrow. So long as saving is equated with sacrifice it will be an uphill battle to save. Having day-to-day life that is as stress-free as possible is very important. Continual sacrifice and stress-free living clash harshly for many people. Some people focus on changing lifestyle-related choices, sometimes called the "latte factor," as a method for realizing day-to-day savings. I agree that this is good advice for some people, but as a first step it isn't necessarily the most effective. There are other things that can be done, too.

1. Reduce monthly fees. Stop paying banking fees for services you don't use or don't need. Many banks charge monthly "service fees" or "maintenance fees" for checking accounts. If your bank offers "free checking" or "free checking with Direct Deposit" (and you have Direct Deposit) switch your account, or find a bank that does offer "free checking." Even the smallest leak in any plumbing system will eventually collect enough water to fill a bathtub, so to will even the smallest recurring monthly service fee eventually steal one month's rent.

2. Detemine a reasonable monthly budget. It is important to know "where it all goes." Rent, utilities, cell phone, car payment, insurance, groceries. There is no doubt these numbers exist, but most importantly nearly all of them can be known in advance. Some of them can't be known exactly, but they can be estimated. My advice is to estimate unknown amounts not for the sake of accuracy ("The cell phone bill is usually $40.00 per month."), but for the sake of certainty ("The cell phone bill has never been more than $80.00 in any month."). In the beginning of making and using budgets, they work best when costs are overestimated rather than underestimated. It is far less uncomfortable to have "too much" money left at the end of the month than it is to have "too little" left over and bills still to be paid at the end of the month.

3. Begin saving automatically. If your employer offers Direct Deposit, and you can open a "free checking" account (with or without Direct Deposit), use this financial automation to the maximum. Open a second checking account. Then contact your HR department to request that your paychecks be split across your two checking accounts.

4. Separate paying bills from saving and investing. Use your primary account for all monthly expenses: rent, utilities, food, car payments and pet food. This is your "Cash" account. The second checking account is dedicated for saving and investment purposes. You won't draw funds from this "Investment" account to pay bills. That isn't what saving is about. Saving is about having money available to fund medium-term and long-term goals. Things like retirement, paying college tuition or buying a home. The "Investment" account will drive all of your automatic saving and investment mechanisms. Similar to Direct Deposit, schedule Automatic Withdrawals to transfer funds from your "Investment" account into high-yield savings accounts (4.50% or better) and retirement accounts (Traditional and Roth IRAs).

Here is how to implement the above steps.

Look at the ING Direct website. ING has savings accounts with excellent interest rates, with no minimum required balance. In addition look at the Vanguard website. If you don't have an IRA, 401k or any other kind of retirement account Vanguard has the lowest custodial costs ($10.00 per year) and lowest minimum required balances (usually $3,000.00) of any financial services company today.

If so I would highly recommend DRIPS, Dividend Reinvestment Plans (DRPs), if only because of the small amount of cash you have available, you cannot afford to be paying ANY commissions, they will eat through your $200 like a hot knife through butter at room temperature. With DRPS you are buying the stocks directly from the company itself without paying those commissions. I would also suggest that you add a set amount of dollars every month to your holdings. Only pick stocks that you have checked out and believe in, especially those that make products you buy and use and like. Look at this for the long term, gradually your account should increase in value. Then you are able to take some of those profits and trade riskier stocks through a regular trading account.

<td>Are their ANY  RISKS of loss in U.S. Tresury bills?If so what?</td>
<td>It depends on what you mean by loss. You may be considering holding the bill for a period shorter than maturity. In that case, you may suffer losses due to an increase of yield rates. As another answerer pointed out, T-bills have short maturities / durations and this will mitigate your exposure to yield increase.
You might consider the loss of opportuniy risk (although that´s kind of pushing it).
But I guess your real concern is with credit (or default) risks. The default risk of any currency issuing government on securities denominated on its own currency are not considered realistic. Lets say that at the time of maturity, the US Treasury did not have sufficient fund to repay and could not raise it by emitting new debt (e.g. new T-bills), it can simply issue more currency.
Each country has different rules as to who decides when to issue currency, but that is something that would certainly be done to avoid a default. In this case, the sudden surplus of money would cause inflationary pressure, causing the dollar amount redeamed to be worth less than expected (it will still be the same amount of dollars though). But, unless your a foreing investor or are considering investing in non dollar denominated securities (e.g. a bond issued by the UK to be payed in BP), the loss of worth is irrelevant, as it affects all financial instruments as well as cash.
In all fairness though, some governments (e.g. Brazil) have chosen to stall payments of debts in their own currency to avoid more currency issuance as an attempt to bring down inflations at very high levels (plus of 40% per month). But having T-bills such short maturities, it would seem very unlikely such scenario would present itself during that period.</td>

<td>What are the criterias in evaluating investment opportunies?How is IRR on equity calculated?</td>
<td>I'm guessing that IRR means interest rate. With equities you incur capital gains or losses. The formula for calculating your gain or loss is:

(Sale Price - Purchase Price)*100 / Purchase Price

Sometimes people new to the stock market think that stocks pay guaranteed rates of return. Stocks move in unpredictable ways, there is never any certainty of profits. In fact successful investors take losses regularly. You must have a plan to manage risk in the stock market.

Different people invest in different ways. Here are some successful people to learn about: William O'Neil, Warren Buffett, Gary Kaltbaum, Tim Truebenbach, Bernard Baruch, George Soros.</td>

Derivatives evolved from a need to negotiate a price for a future delivery date on farmers crops. The earliest commodity producers: corn, wheat, tulips, etc, used forwards to strike deals for their crops before they had been harvested.

Today, there is a wide spectrum of participants in derivatives markets. Speculators, Hedgers, Investors, Producers, Consumers.

Unless you are a corn farmer, or drill oil in your backyard, I would stick with stocks, bonds and mutual funds for at least ten years before even considering derivatives. They carry significant risks.

A person could make many millions of dollars and never trade a derivative.

(Technically, a purchase agreement on a house is a forward contract. This might be the one big derivative trade for most people.)</td>

2.  If, upon periodic evaluation, I can show that a better opportunity in terms of likely long term return exists with less risk.
3.  If the portfolio undergoes a singularity, I check to determine if the portfolio is still holding the best priced low risk stocks.  The measure of which tends to exceed my patience with writing a post.  That would actually be a technical measure since it has to do with price curves rather than fundamentals.  They occur very infrequently but tend to last quite a while.

<td>Companies have differnet interest to consider when they emit stock or bonds. There are company interests and investors interests.
First of all they consider the price of the transaction, that is determined on the primary market when new issues are first offered, generally at a fixed price. In the secondary market the price is determined by demand and supply. 
Sometimes in the secondary market the price is very different from the primary, in this cases the emitting company understands that its estimation of the stock price was wrong.
For example, if a company emits stoks at a fixed price and in the secondary market the price goes dramataclly down, the financial manager will obviously be "happy" because he managed to find founds at a  lower cost. General management on the other hand will be quite less "happy" because investors insatisfaction is a very unplesant thing to deal with.</td>

A treasury bond is issued by a federal government and is the origin of our nation debt.

Price paid vs earnings for the last year.

The lower the P/E is, the better.  
To rate a stock only by P/E, you would want to compare it for all stocks in the field the company is in.  Of course P/E is only one of the many measurements to take into consideration when deciding to purchase a stock.</td>

Assuming they can get at least 51% of the shares to vote in favor of such a merger (if they obtain more than 90% they don't even have to submit it to a vote but can squeeze you out), your only option will be to accept the merger consideration per shares (which will need to be outlined to you) or to exercise your dissenter's rights.

<td>If you are simply going to rely on your income to get a loan then you will not be able to do it. There is going to be too much money to borrow and you will need to have experience with what you are doing if you are relying on future income to qualify for what you planning.

That being said, everyone has been told no that ever did something great, so if you get a business plan together and can convince a banker to go to bat for you then you might be able to pull it off. 

The key to the whole thing is that you will be able to bring in more money than goes out by something that makes it worth going into business. If your returns are beat by a riskless investment rate (govt bonds) then you should not go into business. The only way you will know this is if you put together a business plan that show what you think will happen, what will be the best case, and what will be the worst case. You may want to have different levels of worst case scenario and leave out some of the really bad ones but do work them up and look at them to make sure you know what you are getting into.

Anything you can do to make things more certain will help. Finding tenants ahead of time for example will be hard but will help immensely. 

Good luck if you decide to go ahead, you simply need to perservere. You can always find another like-minded investor to work with you if all else fails(one with money). If not I highly recommend getting into another smaller apartment or single family house to continue your real estate investing. You will be able to qualify much more easily if you build it a little at a time.</td>

<td>Being a Financial Planner, it always makes me uneasy when someone says they want to be a day trader. I have a client that caught that bug back in 1998. He had a little early success so he quit his engineering job and traded full time. Two years latter (when I met him) he had lost a boatload of money, to the extent that he had also rung up $30,000 in credit card debt using cash advances to refuel his account.

It is now 2006, he has most of his debt paid, has been back to work for 6 years, and has settled with the IRS. He had a pretty good understanding of the stock markets when he started.

Why do I say this? You had better take the next 3 to 6 months educating yourself before investing a dollar. For every one person making mad money on stocks, there are a hundred making nothing or even losing most of it.</td>

<td>The best way to get yourself out of a hole is to stop digging.

Don't take on any new debts under any circumstances whatsoever. If you are able to consolidate your debts into a lower interest rate loan, it would be a good idea. Cut up your credit cards.

It is bad form to default on your debts - you took them on, you should pay them off. It will hurt, but it *should* hurt. It is the best way to ensure that you never go into debt again.

You can live on far less money than you think. Be creative. Take every last cent that you can to pay down your debt starting with the highest interest rates. If you want to treat yourself while you are doing this, try some treats that don't cost anything - sign out some DVD's from the library and be a couch potato for the entire weekend if you would like it.

The *single* best investment that you can make is to pay off your debts. Your credit card debt is racking up at almost 30% before taxes. You would have to get a rate of return on an investment that is about 50% per year to get the same return.

Sorry, no pain, no gain.

p.s. Been there, done that, will never be there again. I honestly wish you the best of luck.</td>

<td>What is the nominal rate of interest if the real interest rate is 4% and expected inflation is 3%?</td>
<td>7% ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

Inflation makes everything go down in value compared to the money you have today. My $100 today buys me 100 shmounces (I made up a new unit to make the math easy) of gold. In one year with 3% inflation it will take $103 to buy those same 100 schmounces of gold.

If you are borrowing the money then the cost is 4% and you get the benefit of not losing the 3% that you would have lost if you waited, so 4%-3%= 1% nominal. You pay the 4% in interest rates and the 3% in the amount it didn't go down in value because you got to enjoy the fruits right now.

If you are saving the money then it is 4%-3%=1%. You are paid the 4% interest rate which buys you 3% less when you do spend it.

As you can see inflation helps you in one case and hurts you in the other but the nominal rate is still the same. Weird huh?

<td>Fundamental Analysis vs. Technical Analysis

One of the dominant debates in financial market analysis is the relative validity of the two major tiers of analysis: Fundamental and technical. In Forex, several studies concluded that fundamental analysis was more effective in predicting trends for the long-term (longer than one year), while technical analysis was more appropriate for shorter time horizons (0-90 days). Combining both approaches was suggested to be best suited for periods between 3 months and one year.

Nonetheless, further empirical evidence reveals that technical analysis of long-term trends helps identify longer-term technical “waves”, and that fundamental factors do trigger short-term developments.

You need to supply a salvage value at the end of year 6, or an income stream that goes on forever.

Also you need to supply the interest rate if you want to know when it breaks even. The other option is to just ask for the IRR, internal rate of return. (this is what the bank would be paying if you opened an account and deposited and took out money as you described)

The internal rate of return for the project you listed is 0.61% assuming the sixth year payment is the return value and there is then nothing left. If thats the case you should NOT embark on the project as the riskless rate of return (govt bond) is much higher.

If alternatively you still have the $1,000,000 at the end then the return is 16.55%. Now I would say it has potential as long as the numbers described are not the best case scenarios. If the thing appreciates then even better. It drops to 10% IRR if the end salvage value is about $448,000 just to show where you might consider the cuttoff to be if 10% was a good return for you.</td>

If you go through a bank, they charge a fee and keep some of the interest as payment to themselves. The T-Bill will also be kept in the bank's name, so in the unlikely event of the bank's bankruptcy, you will only become a creditor to the bank and only get some of your money back.

If you go directly through Treasury Direct, you deal directly with the government. There are no fees (except a once per year fee of approximately $35 only if you have more than $100,000 with them), and you get to keep all of the interest. The T-Bills will be registered in your name, so there is no risk of failure of a middleman.

The entire process is done on the Internet, so you don't even need to leave home to do it.

<td>They don't exist (not in the US at this time).  Interest rates on savings accounts reflect market interest rates.  If the fed funds rate is 3.75%, then the savings account rates will have to reflect this relatively low interest rate.
Higher returns are associated with taking on higher risk.  To earn 10%-12% interest rates, you will need to invest in something riskier, like the S&amp;P 500, which has, over the long term, generated a rate of return between 10% and 12%.
And, don't think that if a savings account in England (as an example) is paying 10%, you can just convert your dollars to pounds and invest in the English savings account.  The differential rate of return is already built in to the exchange rates (spot rate and forward rate) between the two currencies, courtesy of the world markets and something called arbitrage.  Arbitrage will instantly wipe out that differential rate of return by a compensating change in exchange rates.</td>

<td>Explain one way in which equity can be thought of as less costly than debt?</td>
<td>The cost of debt, and the cost of equity, should be calculated seperately to see which one is less costly.  The after tax cost of debt is calculated by:

After-tax cost of debt  =  Interest rate x  (1 -  tax rate)

The cost of equity can be calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model:

 Kc   =   Rf   +   beta x ( Km - Rf )

 where

    Kc is the risk-adjusted discount rate (also known as the Cost of Capital);
    Rf is the rate of a "risk-free" investment, i.e. yield on the 10 year treasury bond
    Km is the return rate of a market benchmark, like the S&amp;P 500.</td>

<td>how to buy land in Canada? if I buy a land Do I need pay property tax for unused land?</td>
<td>"From a residency point of view, if you plan to stay in Canada for 6 months or less each year, the government considers you a non-resident, which means that you can still open a bank account and buy property, etc. If you plan to live in Canada for more than 6 months per year, you must apply for immigrant status.
It is important to note, however, that while the majority of Provinces (British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, New Brunswick) have no restrictions on foreign ownership of real estate in Canada, some do limit the amount of property/land that a non-resident can purchase. On Prince Edward Island, non-resident buyers must apply to the Island Regulatory and Appeals Commission for land over 5 acres in size, or land with a shore frontage greater than 165 feet. In Manitoba, non-residents are prevented from owning farmland unless they actually plan to move there within 2 years. Non-residents may not own land over 10 acres in size in Saskatchewan, whilst in Alberta they may only own up to 2 plots of land not exceeding 20 acres in total."
http://www.assignmentscanada.ca/buyingincanada.html

Property tax is levied on all property and rates vary according to market value and usage. However, this is a considered to be a provincial matter, and the rules, rates and regulations vary significantly by Province. 
Further information is available from the Canadian Property Tax Association: http://www.cpta.org/
Links to Provincial Governement websites are listed here: http://canada.gc.ca/othergov/prov_e.html

To find residential properties that are for sale, the official source is the MLS website: http://www.mls.ca/
To find commercial property use: http://www.icx.ca/map.aspx

You will also need a realtor and a lawyer in order to complete a purchase.

For a realtor, choose one that is dealing with a lot of similar properties in the area that you are looking for and make sure that you get some referrals from previous clients.

There are a number of lists of lawyers available online, here is just one example.

If you are a member of a business networking organisation (such as http://www.bni.com/ ), contact your group and see if they have any links with Canadian groups in the area.

<td>What investments that are tax favored &amp; will earn me a conservative 6% exist?--i only have 240$ per month?</td>
<td>Depending on how soon you want to access the invested money, a possible choice would be a non-qualified variable annuity. The pros are your money will grow tax-deferred, you can build in guarantees that your account will do no worse than 6% or even 7%, and when you annuitize you will have a guaranteed stream of income for life.

The cons are there is added cost for having the guarantees (nothing is free), you may have surrender charges if withdrawing mney in the early years (typically 5-7 years, but can be longer or shorter depending on the contract) and withdrawals prior to age 59.5 are taxable and penalized 10%.

I have to say I would be a little worried about your ARM strategy. It isn't a terrible strategy when rates are flat or falling, but rates are rising. The interest rate difference between 3/1, 5/1 and 7/1 ARM's is not very great and easily rivaled by 15 year fixed. Remember, your ARM will adjust at some point and you will either have to refinance or accept the rising rate, and you don't know where fixed rates will be then. 

If you are still committed to this strategy, find a financial planner in your area.</td>

<td>The best home business that you can be sure is not a scam is one that you start yourself. It will depend on what you want, how you define to be interesting. A person may consider a pet sitting business to be the most exciting work in the world, while another person would rather watch TV than take care of dogs. 

The key is to determine what your interests are, what you want to do, what is suitable for your lifestyle and your overall goals, and what can fit with your resources.

Dan Ramsey in his book "101 Best Home Businesses" has a chapter on how to find YOUR best home business. He suggests these 10 steps:

1. List 5 things you do best
2. List how others would benefit from what you do best
3. Find out how to give people what they want
4. Learn the value of your services to others
5. Find out who else offers similar services
6. Learn from the successes of others
7. Learn from the failures of others
8. Plan your own success
9. Make low cost mistakes
10. Enjoy what you do and how you do it

He then made suggestions on the best home businesses according to type. Here are a few of them:

Best Businesses Using Craft or Physical Skills
- antique restoration
- auto detail service
- carpet cleaning business
- errand/delivery service
- housecleaning business

Best Service Businesses 
- bed and breakfast operator
- caregiver
- catering service
- senior day care center
- tutoring service

Best Professional Businesses
- desktop publisher
- magazine writer
- import/export service
- income tax preparation service
- event planner

<td>It's not a easy question to answer it depends on how old you are? What kind of returns you are expecting? How close you are to retirement? How much risks you are willing to take? If you explain i am willing to answer
Based on your answer
Since you are only 29, I suggest that you invest about 40% in stocks (more risky ) about 30% in bonds and funds (less risk) and use the rest to pay off any higher interest credit card/vehicle or loans. If none exist then adjust your investment portfolio accordingly. Bottomline, you are young enough to take the risks to reap the benefits. Seek the advice of a good broker and look at the fundamentals prior to investing and actively manage the portfolio of riskier investments.</td>

When it finally goes out of business, the bankruptcy court takes the airline's sale-able assets and either gives them to the creditors or sells them off and gives the proceeds to the creditors.  Often, this only pays a small fraction of what is owed to the creditors, and then there's nothing left of the airline.  Unfortunately, that means the stock is worthless.  Although, if you hang on to your certificates long enough, they could become collectors items, especially if another airline comes in later and uses the same name (like Braniff, National, or Ozark)</td>

<td>It says to ask anything so, How do I get Government or private Business grants.?</td>
<td>It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.

Nonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.

Even if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.

Even SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... 

"The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."

Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program 

Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs 

For private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for "students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices." Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.</td>

<td>Stocks are a form of gambling, really.  Research the companies and only invest in solid ones with a good plan, you want them to grow and if you see no growth potential they will be a bad investment.  Then you don't know what outside effects will cause your stock to rise or lower.

Real Estate is always good because it's always going to be needed.  There are definitely bad investments in Real Estate but common sense ought to help out there.  If you are able to buy a bad property in a good neigborhood, or in a neigborhood that is going into an upgrade you will do good with it.  The opposite, of course, is bad.  No matter what real estate you have, the property value will not increase rapidly if its in an undesireable area.

Real Estate is a very solid and very controllable investment.  Buy right and try to sell right and you can guarantee a profit.  Stocks aren't guaranteed, ever.  However, if you have money to play with and can survive through the dips in the stock market you can make a lot of money very quickly.</td>

<td>Low risk investment for a 20 year old?</td>
<td>Generally speaking cash equvalents such as money markets, CDs and the like are least risky. Goverment bonds occupy the next rung up on the risk/reutrn ladder, followed by corporate bonds then high yeild or junk bonds. Stepping up one more rung puts you into stocks with the size of the company roughly equating to risk; the smaller the company, the more risk and potential long term return exists.

I agree with Trade Info. You are young and (depending on what you want to invest this money for) you have a long time to remain invested. You can afford to be aggressive. Remeber, risk and return is a trade off. The more you avoid taking risk, the lower the return you will get.

I would recommend speaking to a financial planner in your area. He/she can help you determine what this pool of money means to you, how long you have to stay invested and explore your attitudes towards risk. Once this is done, your planner can recommend an appropriate mix of assets for your investment.

Ask you friends and family who they use. Also, check out the PlannerSearch feature on the Financial Planners Association website, www/fpanet.org</td>

<td>What is matual fund?</td>
<td>You mean a mutual fund?  It is a fund containing many securities (stocks and bonds) from many different companies, so as to spread the risk around.  If some go down, others will go up, and you do not take as large a risk overall.  The value of the fund is generally very dependent on who is choosing the stocks/bonds.  So your care must be taken in choosing the broker or fund developer, rather than learning about individual stocks.  Also, investment companies generally recommend you put your money into several different funds, as they tend to specialize.  Some will be all high-tech firms, some health care companies, etc.  

You need to decide which areas of the economy seem to be going up or down.  One of today's big questions is how the Baby Boomers and their approaching retirement will affect the marketplace.  Health care, most likely, and leisure activities generally: but you have to make your own analysis and choose your mutual funds carefully.  

Putting your money in a pool does not relieve you of the obligation to use your own good judgment.  It just means now you are choosing the pool, not the individual stock.

<td>can u plz explain me what is mutual fund?</td>
<td>A mutual fund is an investment portfolio made up of financial instruments, cash, etc.  It is usually managed by a person, company and might be part of a "family of funds."  A mutual fund might be made up of common stock, bonds, T-bills, or a mixture of all of the above, plus usually a little cash.  

You can buy shares of a mutual fund from the fund itself or through a broker.  For each share you will pay a per/share price, which give you one share of the fund, which contains a fraction of shares of the investment instrument that comprise the fund.

The advantage to mutual funds is that they are a means of automatic diversification, being a safer bet than putting the same amount of money on one stock or in one bond.  They generally are less profitable than putting the same money on a great stock, however are more safe than betting your money on a horrible stock, because the fund is made up of so many components...if one fails, the value of the fund falls, but it doesn't take the whole fund down.

Another advantage is that you can pick afund that is right for your point in your life.  For example, you can pick an "aggressive fund" that is, comprised of common stock, if you are young and not risk adverse.  You can then later sell it and put the money in a more stable fund made up of a mix of stocks and bonds.  When you are retired, you can put the money in an "income fund" that is almost completely safe and made up of interest producing investments.</td>

Simply read as much as you can on the economy, get a feel for the cycle (ie. when things are good versus when things are bad) and get a sense for when it makes sense to take some money out of your investments. I personally suggest watching employment figures. When unemployment ticks up, it's a bad sign. The consumer is a key component to the strength of the economy as a whole. When jobs fail to be created - or worse - when jobs are net-net disappearing, this is a worry. A  very simple tenet, but one to focus on. Good luck.</td>

I think the migration to VOIP that we've seen so far is just the tip of the iceberg. One reason is that I think prices (at least those set by the cable companies) are soft. Time Warner has signed up a million, apparently most of them at $40 a month. These apparently are customers who don't know about or are not comfortable with companies like Vonage who offer the service for $25. This means that if the supply of new potential customers starts to dry up for the cable company, all they will need to do is cut prices by 20-30% to unlock a whole new tier of customers.</td>

<td>Investment: how do I invest $50,000 using Dollar Cost Averaging?</td>
<td>At the end of the day it's your money and you are the one responsible for it's performance. Are you investing in stocks or mutual funds? 

The wisdom of averaging into stocks is debatable. If you want to dollar cost average into mutual funds a decent strategy would be to buy a fund comparable to the Russell 2000, Nasdaq or S&amp;P500 when it is well below it's 200 day moving average. Maybe try buying in fifths. It has been a while since this last happened, you never know what the future will bring.

There are no guarantees in investing.

Follow Up: Learn what a 200 day moving average is. Leave your money in a Money Market Fund until what you want to buy is well below it's 200 day moving average. 

This only happens once and a while, five times would probably be better than ten times, depends on how many years you're going to hold it for, and in the end it's your decision.

Don't do it on a set schedule. Buy when the market is down.

Once you would find it you will have to understand how much you are willing to risk? Let's assume that you could loose much of it... I would suggest reading the SEC reporting done by Asset Managers such as Capital and Brandes Investment Partners which are value managers and do a lot of research. With some ideas from this list bring them to your financial advisor for double check. Good Luck, Milan</td>

You will, however, be loosing out on the returns that you might be getting if you invested in a wider array of securities, such as stocks and stock mutual funds.</td>

<td>Is the dollar going to fall in 2006?</td>
<td>whilst it is impossible to be sure when forecasting any economic occurences, there are some distinct factors which suggest the dollar will fall sometime in the near future.

the main one is the US current accounts deficit (which is about $800 billion). at some point overseas lenders will become tired of dollar-denominated assets, and decide they no longer are interested in America's ever increasing rate of debt. this will result in a fall of the dollar as American exports are encouraged in order to pay off those creditors.

some speculators suggest that the dollar is already grossly overvalued for two main reasons, both to do with China. one is that the Chinese yuan has been kept artificially low by the Chinese goverment in order to encourage Chinese exports. because the US conducts so much "dollar" business with China then an undervalued Yuan has resulted in an overly powerful dollar. the other is that that the Chinese federal reserve has bought significant amounts of dollar-denomintated assets (such as US bonds) in order to encourage the scarcity of the US currency. when these two factors shift (as is inevitable) then the dollar will experience significant devaluation. 

this will play out as follows - the Yuan will become more powerful as the Chinese standard of living increases and Chinese people show more interest in importing overseas products. the Dollar will diminish in scarcity when the Chinese government sells its US assets.

domestically the rate of household debt both to overseas creditors and also owed to the overpriced equity and housing bubbles are enough to speculate that the US may be headed for some level of recession. if investor confidence in the United States is jeopardized then this will also result in "capital flight" (ie investors taking their money to other countries). if this were to happen then the US dollar would become less prized, and thus decrease in foreign exchange value.

nevertheless, it is worth bearing in mind that many of the world's greatest investment and economic minds (like Warren Buffett) have speculated or even bet against the dollar, but it has continued to remain strong. obviously these things are impossible to predict, but the factors I have cited may suggest that at some point in the next few years the dollar will diminish in value.</td>

Each ADR is issued by U.S. depositary banks and represents one or more shares of a foreign stock or a fraction of a share. If investors own an ADR they have the right to obtain the foreign stock it represents, but U.S. investors usually find it more convenient to own the ADR. The price of an ADR is often close to the price of the foreign stock in its home market, adjusted for the ratio of ADRs to foreign company shares.

Individual shares of a foreign corporation represented by an ADR are called American Depositary Shares (ADS).</td>

<td>An investment company that pools money from shareholders and invests in a variety of securities, such as stocks, bonds and money market instruments. Most open-end mutual funds stand ready to buy back (redeem) its shares at their current net asset value, which depends on the total market value of the fund's investment portfolio at the time of redemption. Most open-end mutual funds continuously offer new shares to investors.

Mutual Fund is  near perfect way to diversify. A mutual fund is a collection of stocks, from different companies, combined (or co-mingled) together to provide one single investment. An example might be a mutual fund that invests 10% in bank stock, 25% in retail outlet stock, 25% in medical technology stock, 25% in high tech stock and the remaining % in government securities. The mutual fund attracts money from many investors and manages the "mix" of stocks, often for a fee.</td>

Under the following assumptions, the S&amp;P is fairly valued at 1265: 1) the current dividend yield is 3%, which includes roughly 1% in buybacks. 2) earnings will grow at 9% over the next 5 years. 3) the long-term growth rate of stock market earnings is 6%.

The second and third assumptions are the hardest to predict, but they are fair at the levels given above. A dramativ slowdown in earnings growth, or actual earnings declines associated with a recession would hit the index hard. Essentasilly the message is that the index is roughly fairly valued at this time.</td>

It sounds like you want to retain a high degree of liquidity for this investment. If this is the case, consider the money market. Seek an institution that consistently offers great rates. Watch out for smaller banks that come out of nowhere with a sepcial or introductory rate. I use ING Direct, but I have heard good things about HSBC direct also.

Try not to go for a secured loan, if you have no choice then try to offer the assets and business as collateral.

<td>Credit is the lifeblood of American business, especially for the smaller firm. It helps an entrepreneur get started, purchase equipment, build inventory, develop new lines of merchandise or expand. Credit helps businesses grow.

Surveys have found that, aside from personal savings, banks are the major source of capital for starting new firms. According to a report by the National Federation of Independent Business, 85% of loans to operating small businesses come from banks.

If your small business needs financing, you need to begin preparing long before you enter the bank. By knowing what lenders are looking for, you can speed lender consideration of your application.

By presenting your case in the best possible light, you enhance your chances of getting the financing you need. Remembering this basic rule may save you time and effort when seeking bank financing for your business. Here are basic guidelines

The first thing you need to know is narrow down your request by answering the following questions:

1. How much do you need?

2. What are you going to use the proceeds of the loan for, and for how long?

3. How are you going to repay the loan, and under what terms?

4. Who is going to borrow the money? Is it going to be you personally or other legal entity such as a corporation or a partnership?

5. What assets can you pledge to secure your loan, which would make your loan officer sleep soundly at night, if he decides to approve your loan?

The Groundwork

In seeking a loan for your firm, you essentially ask the bank to become your business partner. Before entering the market for a loan, make sure you've done all necessary groundwork.

What shape is your business in? Remember, loans are the products that banks sell. Look for the best combination of price, quality and reputation of supplier. In the end, getting a loan depends upon your credit-worthiness. Ask your banker for assistance.</td>

<td>Find a local stock broking firm that can trade in that market or stock exchange (it may cost you more in transaction fee to invest in a foreign market).
Just tell them you want to invest the stocks in that exchange and ask them if they can do this for you.

Otherwise, find a local broking firm in that country and open a foreign account with them. Depending on certain countries, they may not accept foreign investor without any prove or some supporting information because of tax issues.

Another way is to buy existing investment funds related to that market.</td>

<td>There is a computer program that you can buy, I don't know what its called.  But if you haven't finished school. And you can't find a good stock program..then go into construction or lawn care. Welders make like $20 dollars a hour min.  As far as the stock market, basically you've got to be able to predict popular trends and learn to read the trade arrow up good, arrow down bad, also how much did it go up/down from before? Also, will pple really need it?
Maybe you should try a software stock, those tax softwares are bound to be very popular. 
It can be done, I made like $500 dollars in one day, not real money, I was doing it for a class. But I made more fake cash than anyone else. There are 2 types of stock...im fuzzy on this, one is like groceries and stuff..ppl will always buy and it is a lower risk and you make less money. Then there is technology, higher risk, they may not sell, but if they do you make lots of cash.
Either way its really risky. I recommend construction work.</td>

Today you can buy 1,000,000 Iraq dinar for $800-$1200. That is about  0.0008 to 0.0012 cents per dinar, if it moves two decimal places that is a profit of 1,000% NICE</td>

You need to know your fundamentals but as a trader, charting and technical indicators are much more important.

Investment banks differ from commercial banks, which take deposits and make commercial and retail loans. In recent years, however, the lines between the two types of structures have blurred, especially as commercial banks have offered more investment banking services. In the US, the Glass-Steagall Act, initially created in the wake of the Stock Market Crash of 1929, prohibited banks from both accepting deposits and underwriting securities; Glass-Steagall was repealed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1998. Investment banks may also differ from brokerages, which in general assist in the purchase and sale of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. However some firms operate as both brokerages and investment banks; this includes some of the best known financial services firms in the world.</td>

<td>are energy mutual funds still a good investment?</td>
<td>The responder before me gave you some good advice.  I would like to add a few things.  Energy today is similar to gold 30 years ago.  It is your hedge against inflaction, uncertainty, and political upheaval.  In that context I believe it should be part of any investment portfolio.  Now oil may drop back to $20 a barrel and you may loose a bundle on your energy mutual fund. But if energy does drop back, it will be a boom to the rest of the economy and the rest of your porfolio will more than take care of the loss.  But lets suppose that oil goes to $70 a barrel or $80.  What do you think will be the best investment in that case? 

Let's look at the politcal climate around the world. What has happened in Venezuela? What is going to happen in Mexico? What happened in Venezuela is getting ready to happen in Mexico. Do you know how much oil is supplied to the US by these two countries? A lot. 

Now let's ask ourselves about GWB. He invaded Iraq and told us Iraq oil would pay for the war. Well, has it?  What has happened to Iraq oil production? For that matter, what is happening to the country?  What is going to happen with Iran? 

To tell you the truth I had rather hold oil stocks now than about any other stock I can think of. When everybody else whines about the price of gas and gasoline, I just look at my porfolio and smile. 

So my recommendation, for what it might be worth, if anything. At least 15% in energy to maybe 30%.</td>

<td>What makes more sense for a lower-middle class income a traditional IRA or a ROTH IRA?</td>
<td>I agree, A ROTH IRA makes more sense in a lower-middle class income situation.  You don't really need an income tax deduction right now.

There IS a reason to open a traditional ira, however.  If you were in a high tax bracket, you would be able to lower your reported income by $4,000 this year (or $5,000 if you are over 50 years), thus potentially lowering your tax bracket.

If you have a 401k at work, ask about the brand new ROTH 401k, which puts after tax money into a 401k for you.  Again, this would be perfect in your situation, since you could put away more than $4,000 (up to $15,000 this year) and the money would come out tax free at retirement, when you could potentially be in a higher tax bracket.</td>

BIG has 500 shares trading at 10 dollars per share.  BIG has a market value of 5000.

SMALL has 200 shares trading at 5 dollars per share.  SMALL has a market value of 1000.

After the merger it can be deducted that the NEW BIG company will be worth 6000.  If you own stock in BIG company your amount of shares and value will remain unchanged (only for example purpose, normally stock in BIG company would go up because investors realize BIG wouldn't merge unless it was a profitable tranaction).  If you own shares in SMAll you would recieve 1 Share of BIG for every 2 shares of SMAll you own.  What is left is 600 shares of BIG at 10 per share or 6000 dollars.

In the case of a demerger, BIG will give a dividend of 1.67 dollars per share to its stock holders equaling 1000 dollars.  1.67 x 600 = 1000.  SMALL will offer 200 shares of its stock for 5 dollars each. 200 x 5 = 1000.</td>

<td>What is the process of buying stock? How do you do it and how does it work? Explain how you would get money?</td>
<td>Good question. Stock or shares represent ownership of a company. The bylaws of each company set out the rights of each individual company's stock. Sometimes shares have voting rights or pay dividends.

The prices quoted in the stock market represent what investors will pay for a company's equity. A PE ratio represents the value based on how much the market is willing to pay for $1 of a company's earnings.

Shares are bought and sold in the stock market. For each stock there is either a physical (NYSE) or electronic (NASDAQ) place where people and instituions meet to buy and sell shares. For each stock there is a bid and ask. You pay a little more to buy stock than when you sell it. The beauty of developed markets is their liquidity. The bid and ask prices are usually pretty close together. This could change at any time though.

Stock prices change based on supply and demand for the shares. If there are more buyers than sellers the price goes up. If there are more sellers than buyers the price goes down. Investors base their buying and selling decisions on many different things.

Examples of successful people involved in the stock market are William J. O'Neil, Gary Kaltbaum, Warren Buffett, Rob Hanna, Alan Farley, James Cramer, Ben Stein and Suze Orman.</td>

To achieve an appropriate investing 'mindset' for long-term investing in U.S. stocks, it may help to look at a chart of the dow jones average over the years 1928 through 2005. You'll see a graph with a line that increases with time (i.e., average returns of roughly 10% per year).

A good way to use P/E to discover value in selecting stocks is to first start with a sector.  Find a sector that is in favor.  Look up the average P/E for that sector.  Different sectors will have different P/E ratios.  You have to compare apples to apples.  Look up which companies are growing the fastest and that have the most promise in that sector and then compare their P/E ratios to the sectors P/E ratio.  All other things being equal the company that is growing faster than the sector with a P/E less than the sector would be considered undervalued and you might considering buying it.</td>

Don't "bottom feed" stocks that appear to be cheap or "chase" what other investors are buying.  Be disciplined and follow your own program.  When you get nutty is when you start losing.

Use the "PE" ratio as a guide.  Anything with a PE of 20 or so is fairly priced but might be a long term buy and hold.  Anything with a PE over 60 or so isn't priced (stock) fairly in comparison to the earnings (per share) it generates.  That doesn't mean "don't buy" but it translates into more risk.

Globally, I am among the best investors in the world, statistically speaking.  If you have to ask the question you are not qualified to start.

The State of Georgia did a study on daytrading several years ago.  It required brokerages to turn over the records of all Georgia customers, names and particulars excluded of course.  They found that 90% of Georgia daytraders lost 100% of their investment, while only 1% were profitable.

Daytrading only works if you hold a seat on an exchange or are a member of the NASDAQ.  When you daytrade, what you are really doing is building up an inventory of stocks OR setting money aside to be a buyer of last resort.  Most people don't think of it that way, but that is really what you are doing.  What this permits is that the traditional role played by the specialist on an exchange, or market maker on the NASDAQ is being played by you.  The only problem is that you have to pay them to participate.  You are taking all of the risk, but they are the ones collecting off of it.  In fact, you reduce their risk doing this because you are stepping into their role, without the reward.  You set yourself in a position where you are competing against people with real power, and they are going to charge you to compete as well.

<td>how to invest in stock market and further details?</td>
<td>OK.

Best investment that you can make is education. Not necessarily formal education, but education nonetheless. Any bookstore or your local library will have racks and racks of investment books.

The biggest thing that you have to keep telling yourself is this - "my broker is a salesman and nothing else". Every "hot tip" you act on from him gives him a commission whether you make money or lose money - it makes no difference to him.

Nobody cares more about your money than you. So learn everything you can about it.

Start by building up a 3 month cash reserve in a savings account. This is money that is not to be spent, but is there "for a rainy day". And it will rain lots of days.

After that, consider some liquid investments such as GIC's or T-Bills. You can purchase T-Bills online at http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/indiv.htm. It is easy to do, and you cut out the middleman by dealing directly with the Treasury. Treasury bills are exempt from state taxes, making them a better bet than many others - and there are no safer term deposits.

Learn how to do your own taxes. Learn the different rates for income, dividends, capital gains. It's not how much you make, it's how much you *keep* that's important. DO NOT CHEAT ON YOUR TAXES. You will lose far too much this way.

After that, consider some mutual funds. You will get diversification at relatively low fees. Watch the fees though.

After that, consider investing on your own. At that point, you will not need anybody else's advice.</td>

<td>Based on the P/E of the broader stock market index, how do u determine whether the market is overvalued?</td>

However. 
1) What is "the" interest rate to be taken into account? First, it should a real interest rate. Second, it should be an interest rate for assets with THE SAME uncertainty as the stock market (or see 3 below)
2) The P/E can be larger if you expect profits to grow a lot and/or for a long period.
3) The P/E can be larger if the uncertainty (volatilty) tends to diminish.

Currently, volatility has been coming down for several years; the markets expect economic growth (hence expect profit growth) and this two factors "justify" high P/E ratios. Question: when high is high enough? When one stops being rational and starts finding "wild" explanations?</td>

<td>what are the risks for investing in iraq dinar?</td>
<td>Mostly that you will be throwing your money away on worthless currency.

I believe the dinar will lose value if it is ever allowed to float. The value has been stable near 1476 dinar to the dollar since the Coalition began trading the new Iraqi dinar. There is a need to keep the value stable so that international contractors can pay Iraqi subcontractors with a predictable exchange rate. The Bank of Iraq has shown little tendency to allow the exchange rate to change. At present only banks in Jordan and Kuwait will accept dinars outside of Iraq. These banks are doing this to accommodate their own large business with contractors in Iraq. There is no true international exchange for Iraqi dinars. 

Here is the Bank of Iraq currency auction:
http://www.cbiraq.org/cbs6.htm

The only thing that will save the Iraqi economy will be oil, and right now that looks to be many years, if not decades away from recovering. Iraq is presently not producing as much oil as it was before the war. Many oil wells have been permanently damaged by being shut-in and not allowed to produce. Infrastructure has been damaged and will be hard to repair while there are hostile forces present. An oil rig makes a really big, well-lighted, extremely explosive target that cannot move to escape snipers or other weapons. No oil company is going to drill for oil under those circumstances and risk losing the entire drill rig as well as many lives. Even when Iraq becomes stable enough for exploration and drilling to resume, it will take years to find and produce any new discoveries. Current fields may have production increased by development drilling, but may be more limited in potential. 

Iraq may contain significant oil reserves, but has always been a minor exporter of oil, and presently barely manages to produce more oil than is consumed within the country. Much of the export of Iraqi oil is offset by imports from Kuwait and other countries in the form of refined products. 

My own opinion of the Iraqi dinar is that if it were allowed to float it would drop precipitously. It might reach millions of dinar to the dollar as the Turkish lira did before it was revalued recently. I think there is likely to be a rush to buy foreign currencies with dinars when the holders of dinars are allowed to trade them freely. Until the Iraqi economy is self-supporting again, which may be decades, I doubt that the dinar will be freely traded, so it has very little potential to appreciate anytime soon. 

I also would not be surprised if the Bank of Iraq eventually chose to tie the dinar to the dollar, as many other currencies have done. This means as long as you are hoping to exchange your dinars for dollars, you will never realize any gain on your dinars. 

You may have to take a vacation to Baghdad to use Iraqi dinars. Is that your plan?

<td>Hi!

I'm a professional trader in forex as well as stocks. I make a living out of it... The main strategy is to follow the long term trend. That is the simplest strategy to follow. If that trend starts going against you - take profits or limit your losses. Simple. The hard thing is to overcome your emotions of excitement to take profits too early or emotion of greed of loss when you want to cut your loss.

Some other people may reel off a whole list of strategies here but I'm a true believer in Keeping it Simple. Trade with a plan, an exit plan that takes into consideration your risk management.

Start with the basic MA's and MACD's etc... if you can't make a profit using a very simple system I don't see why a complicated system would make you any money.

The long-term annual gain of the the US Market is about 12%/year. This is much better than the 2.5% annual gain of a bank account. However, you have to be patient with the stock market as it goes up and down.

<td>I know nothing is guaranteed, but what can I do to ensure between 8-10% return on my porfolio?</td>
<td>I had the same goal as you a few years ago. If you're looking for a certain return, you need to anchor your portfolio. Look for high-rated, consistent funds on Morningstar. Look through their past returns to see how volatile the fund has been (for example, a fund might have ended the year with a 10% return, but if it lost 25% in the second quarter, you may not want it in your portfolio), and look to see how long the fund manager has been there (if the manager has been at the helm for 30 years and has been making money consistently, they've probably got no plans to change course).

The two funds I started out with as my anchors were hybrid moderate allocation funds (about 60/30/10 in stock/bonds/cash), DODBX and OAKBX. Their 5-year annualized returns are 9.93% and 10.63%, respectively, and they've only been down for 5 out of 24 quarters over the past three years. I've moved a lot of money out of these funds as I've gotten more aggressive, but I highly recommend OAKBX. DODBX is now closed to new investors; but PRWCX is quite similar.

A good way to look for funds like this is to use Morningstar's Fund Screener (see below) and set similar benchmarks for the 1, 3, and 5-year returns. This will allow you to find year-over-year consistency.</td>

* exchange rate movements, especially the change in the value of the yen, and

* commodity price movements.

These factors come through quite clearly and strongly.... Speculators may well have been active while the $A has been fluctuating wildly. However, there is nothing ...to indicate that the $A has been out of line with the factors that ultimately determine its value. It would be safe to conclude that if there has been speculation against the $A it has not been destabilising. That conclusion would not necessarily follow in the case of the Malaysian ringgit and some of the other Asian currencies. The discussion above pointed to major overshooting of some of those exchange rates.

The future could be interesting if the commodity prices and the yen move in different directions. ...analysis suggest the $A follows both the yen and commodity prices quite closely. The yen relationship is recent and might be expected to break under pressure with the result that commodity prices would be restored to their historic role as a regulator of the $A's value.

<td>depends on how active a trader you will be. if you are just buying and holding without keeping a large cash balance then Scottrade is a good choice. Low Commissions.

Fidelity.com has very good rates for active traders and has great mutual funds and high paying money market funds for idle cash balances.

Schwab.com commissions are slightly higher, but if you are a very active trader they will compete with other brokers to get your commission rates down.

Brown &amp; Co is now part of Etrade, since I don't care for Etrades service or market making I cannot recommend them at all. Brown is only $5.00 per trade.

Ameritrade... I know many people who use them. It seems as if the website for trading is down to often for me. Schwabs Streetsmart Pro is rarely out of service.</td>

Those able to profit from their operations consistently are among the highest level businesspeople in the world. Many people do gamble on stocks. It doesn't have to be like a casino, but many people treat it that way.

On a basic blackjack hand, when you lose, you lose 100%. In the stock market, you (usually) get to decide how much you lose. My absolute limit is 7%, but usually less. With time you can learn to hold stocks until they go up at least 21%. In this way you have built a 1:3 risk reward / ratio. Try getting that in any casino.

<td>what does the alpha/beta value of a stock mean?</td>
<td>The alpha and the beta are used to measure the risk of a stock (they are more commony used with mutual funds and money managers).  The beta of a stock measures the volatility of the stock compared to the overall market, sector, or other index.  The beta for the market (S&amp;P 500) = 1.00.  If a stock has a beta of .85, it means that the stock is 15% less volatile than the market.  If the stock has a beta of 1.5, it means that the stock is 50% more volatile than the market.

The Alpha is used to measure the risk adjusted return of a stock.  In other words, if a stock has a beta of 1.5, it should give you 1 1/2 times the return of the underlying index.  If it doesn't, then why take the extra risk if it is not going to provide you with the same amount of extra return.  Obviously you want to find investments with the most amount of return with the least amount of risk.

 I hate to be the bearer of BAD news, but here I am the Grim Reaper of Toasted Stocks. First forget about Sirius, there a also ran. If you HAVE to play SATRADIO, then XM is your only play, and long term at that, even with their cash burn. I don't like the whole concept of satellite radio, personally. Even with subscriptions increasing (thanks to Howard) Sirius stock is still dropping, there burning through cash faster than Cheney &amp; Crew, OK, maybe not quite as fast, eventually, the banks and investors will throw in the towel or merge with XM, and even that would still be a problem, and XM had one of their departing directors bad mouth them the other day. http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1927832,00.asp
Sony got there own problem. They slept through the 90's and ALLOWED Samsung to beat them at there own game, Hollywood beat them to a pulp. They need a KILLER product and PS is not it. LCD "was/is" there best bet. Cut prices on the high end LCD and work on volume and they may have a shot. At least until they come up with another Walkman,Trinitron or Betamax. Ouch, that last one gotta hurt. Hopefully Blu-Ray http://www.blu-ray.com/ won't be a repeat.
  As for Mr.Softee, I see no major upside movement. Though a good steady long term appreciation is not out of the question. They may be too big to fail, but at the same time too big to steer. Sorry Billy Boy. 
I would stay with oil service, raw commodities, and storage device companies. You do your homework and pick'em. As Jim Cramer would say, "stick with best of breed".

NEWS ALERT: This article came out today, 02/21/06 a day AFTER my original musings here. So I thought I would add it here to bolster my position on SONY.

One Canadian producer is Cameco. Shares trade on the NYSE $73.37 per share.

Another is Areva, a French company. Their stock is traded on the pink sheet as ARVCF.PK

<td>It will depend upon the facilities you currently have, and their output.  If your facility produced 10 million units 150,000 would only be a small amount and may not cause much increase in your costs.  If your manufacturing equipment runs on oil or some kind of support requirements that are increased by the number of units this could increase with 150,000 additional units.  Now if you are currently producing 10,000 units and your facilities have a capacity of 50,000 you will need to purchase new manufacturing equipment to support the additional demand, but if your costs for your equipment are independent of the number of units you produce and the quantity you wish to produce can be supported by your current equipment your fixed costs would not increase, and your fixed costs per unit would decrease. 

Variable costs which are not included in your fixed manufacturing overhead cost will also more than likely increase based on your production since you will need more staff to box or ship your new items.</td>

<td>Better for whom, Microsoft or investors?

From an investmant point of view - you probably know what you will get from a microsoft bond. There would obviously be very low risk of default - probably not much rate of return either. 

As for stock, Microsoft releasing $250 Million more in stock shares can't do much for the price of the stock already out there. Make your own value judgement based on theeir financials.

from microsoft perspective, they probably would be better off not diluting stock shares. With their rock solid financials I would probably just releases a bond issue, though I can't guess why they would ahve to raise money.</td>

<td>seems like you are making this more complex than it is. a company can pay 100% of its earnings out as a dividend plus any available cash and assets that are liquidated. obviously at that rate eventually it would be fully liquidated. most companies need to put some of the net income into growth, r&amp;d, etc.

if a company at 10.00 per share pays out 1.00 in dividends, then its yield is 10%. if the price goes to 20.00 then its yield is 5%.</td>

<td>Options trading vs. Stock trading - which provides least risk?</td>
<td>most online brokers have some minimums. they vary. in order to day trade, as i recall you need $25,000 minimum. there is a formula that they used to determine if you are a "pattern day trader". you must follow the rules and have the cash in the account to pay for the trades you make. you get a few strikes and then they will prohibit you from trading your account if you don't have funds available. do a search on the site of the broker you choose for day trading rules.

Learn before you burn yourself out. Most (and i really mean most) people lose money day trading. You need a discipline that is hard to master. You need to know how and when to take a loss as this is what saves you to trade again in search of the winners. Stop loss orders are very important. And you need to realize that you are trading against professionals who get better executions of orders, have better information and faster access to it. You are also trading against computer programs.

Options are for the most part a highly speculative venture unless you are writing covered calls to try and boost your return on your long positions.

<td>what is meant by pivot calculator in day trading ?Give ananswer with a good and relevent example THANK YOU?</td>
<td>A pivot point is a price that someone thinks is important, usually based on price history like the highest high of the past x days or yeterday's close.  A lot of gay people throw this word around without defining what they are talking about and it is annoying.  Like Bill O'neil does this in his famous and lame book, "How to Invest in Stocks"  He just goes on and on about pivot this and pivot that without actually defining it.  So don't get thrown off by all the douchebags who do this.
Just about any point that jumps out at you from the chart could be a pivot point for someone, the more obvious, the more powerful the action can be around that point.  So all time highs or lows definitely qualify.
Also a lot of people look at the moving averages so, for instance if price bounces off of the 20 exponential moving avearge, the high of that price bar could be a pivot.
For intraday trading, any highest high or lowest low over the past one or more days is a pivot, as well as the intraday high and low.  Pivots that are also major pivot levels from the daily chart like the all time price high or low of bars around the 20, 50, and 200 day moving averages are all the more powerful intrady.
Traders either look to fade the price at a pivot (sell when the price comes to a pivot from underneath or buy when price reaches the pivot from above)and make profits when it turns back away or they bet on the breakout of a level - when price keeps going past the pivot.
Those who "fade" the pivot believe price will reverse - that a price trend is turning or that prices will be stable on the higher time frame and thus will gravitate back to more typical prices.  Those who take breakouts believe the price reaching the pivot point is evidence of stronger forces at work that will push prices even further in that direction.
As an example of an intraday pivot that has the added power of being at an important daily level, consider the recent prices of GOOG.  When you chart the daily chart with the 200 day exponential moving average (exponential seem to be followed by more people and in faster stocks), you see the "test" of that level 3 days ago.  Note that GOOG has never traded long under this level.
For intraday traders yesterday, the high of that "test bar" on the daily chart, 346.00 was a pivot point that had explosive "breakout" potential since longer-term buyers come in at these levels and push up prices so often.  Obviously, this bore out yesterday as you can see from the 5-minute chart.
PS -- All kinds of levels might work AND what works can change over time.  In Jesse Livermoore's book, he says that for a while it was his bread and butter to buy for a quick pop every time a price multiple of 100  was passed by a stock (a pivot not even based on the price history of the stock).  Nowadays, this seems like more of a resistance level.</td>

<td>Is an indexed annuity a good way to save?</td>
<td>OK, alot of the info coming here is right, alot is wrong.

An EIA is a deferred annuity (allowing you to invest money now and defer the taxes on the growth until withdrawal) whose performance will be tied to some market index. There are three main benefits to an EIA.

1) Growth on invested money is not taxed. Whenever a mutual fund or ETF makes any portfolio changes (to mark changes in an index, for example) any capital gains tax burden is passed through to shareholders resulting in that 1099 you get each year. Same goes for any dividends paid by the underlying investments.

2) Downside protection - In very simple terms, an EIA tracking the S&amp;P 500 would work like this. Typically the EIA will have a cap on returns at, say 10%. In a year where the index returns over the cap, your account is credited with 10%. If the index return falls between 0% and the cap, your account is credited with that rate of return. If the index suffers a loss, your account stays flat. Your account value is protected from the loss. Essentially, you give up the top end for a guarantee of not losing money in a down year.

3) Annuitization options - When you get to retirement you can annuitize the contract. This is essentially trading in the account value for a guaranteed stream of income guaranteed to last at least as long as you are alive. Taxation on non-qualified (Not an IRA) annuities is ordinary income, but only on the gain in the contract.

The downside of EIA's(and annuities in general) is the extra layer of cost. You don't get anything for free, the guarantees associated with annuities have to be paid for.

Depending on your age, tax situation and attitudes towards risk, an annuity might be the right investment for a portion of your money. I would consider a good Variable Annuity before an EIA. You can get better downside risk while retaining the chance to participate in above average market returns when they occur.</td>

<td>"Beta is the slope of the best fit line obtained when excess return on the portfolio (or asset) over the risk-free rate is regressed against the excess of return of the market over the risk-free rate."
If the risk-free for a given period is 5% and an asset has a return of 12%, it has an excess of return of that asset over the risk-free rate is 12%-5% = 7%.
So a beta = 1 value would indicate that the stock "tends" to folow the market. A beta = 2 value would indicate that the stock "tends" to folow the market´s direction, but with movements twice as large. Negative betas indicate tendencies to move in the inverse direction of the market: when the market goes up the asset goes down and vice-versa. Beta does not measure the correlation though, meaning that this relation may be very tight or loose.
Beta = 0 does not mean that the asset has low volatility, it simply means there is no linear relation between the asset and the market.</td>

<td>what is split the stock?</td>
<td>Stock Splits
When a company declares a stock split, the price of the stock will decrease, but the number of shares will increase proportionately. For example, if you own 100 shares of a company that trades at $100 a share and it declares a two for one stock split, you will own a total of 200 shares at $50 a share after the split. A stock split has no effect on the value of what shareholders own. If the company pays a dividend, your dividends paid per share will also fall proportionately.

Companies often split their stock when they believe the price of their stock exceeds the amount smaller individual investors would be willing to pay for the stock. By reducing the price of the stock, companies try to make their stock more affordable to these investors.

Although many stock splits are two for one, companies can split their stock in any number of ways, including three for one, three for two, and so forth. A stock that has split in the last 52 weeks will be identified in newspaper stock columns with an "S" next to the company's name.</td>

<td>When will the Iraqi Dinar begin to curculate?</td>

If you are asking when it will be allowed to be exchanged on currency markets, then the answer is uncertain. Right now the Bank of Iraq has allowed banks in Jordan and Kuwait to exchange dinars in order to accommodate the many contractors in those countries that are doing business in Iraq. There is no requirement that the Iraqi dinar ever be allowed to openly trade. Some countries do not exchange their money outside of their own borders in order to keep wealth from fleeing the country, although this seldom works because money will move in the form of goods. It will depend entirely on the business needs of the Iraqi government. Since the price of the dinar relative to the dollar has remained essentially unchanged since the new dinar was introduced by the Coalition, it appears that there are no plans to allow it to openly trade anytime soon.  As long as the government of Iraq has the ability to bring in hard currency from oil exports, they have no need to exchange their internal currency, other than to encourage small business. 

Here is the Bank of Iraq daily currency auction:
http://www.cbiraq.org/cbs6.htm

These rules, which are applied equally to urban and suburban housing despite key differences, effectively force many American families to move to distant locations to own homes.

For many prospective homebuyers, the key roadblock to home ownership is "the mortgage qualification".

Mortgage qualification is determined by screening the applicant by the use of two ratios. The first ratio computes principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI) and compares monthly payments to gross monthly income. An upper limit, typically 28% but occasionally "stretched" a few percentage points, is used as a primary screen. The secondary ratio looks at total recurring monthly payments, including both PITI and other debt, such as automobile loans, long term credit card debt, personal loans, and student loans. A typical limit for all debt payments is 36% of gross income.

Revised formulas for location efficient mortgages 

Primary Ratio :     PITI - TS £ .28 x income

Secondary ratio : PITI + other long term debt - net transportation savings £ .36 x income

That is if you paper trade.

Honestly, if you want to own actual shares, the minimum recommended amount is around $2000 to make any decent returns.

If you live in UK or Australia you can use an instrument called CFDs which allow you to open $100,000 positions with only $1000 - basically 100:1 leverage. Using CFD's the minimum depends on which provider you choose. I heard you could even put in $10 if you wish on a CFD trade. CFD's are a share derivative that derive their value from the underlying share.</td>

<td>Has Anyone Ever Heard Of Arbitrage Trading??</td>
<td>By definition, arbitrageours take advantage of discrepancies in the market to profit.  For example: ABC stock trades at the NYSE and at the Phily exchanges.  Well, some arbitrageours will look for real time price discrepancies between the two exchanges, and capitalize on those discrepancies.  If the ask for ABC at the NYSE is say $50.00 a share, and the ask price at the Phily Exchange is say $50.05 per share, then the trade will be in such maner as to take advantage of that price discrepancy.  Other way to participate in arbitrage would be to say: well...I think that Maytag is an expensive stock based on multiple, and I think that whirlpool is cheap based on multiple. So my arbitrage strategy will be to short sell Maytag, and long whirlpool.  Arbitrage because i am betting that the market will realize and fully value whirlpool, while realizing that maytag is over priced thus trimming its appreciation.  Key here is that I am engaging in arbitrage because i am tradidng virtually equivalent securities.  Hope this helps.</td>

To present you with sound advice, I would need to know your acceptance to risk, what per cent of your total assests does $25,000 represent, how old you are, what your annual income is and whether you have dependent children.  

Assuming that you wish to assume average risk and that $25,000 represents 80% of your total liquid assests and that you earn over $50,000 a year and that you are under 30 years old and that you have no children:

I do not recomment REIT's.  Real estate is way overvalued in my oppinion and very subject to interest rates. 

Give some thought to these potential investments:

Home Depot-HD.  A solid company trading at a very reasonable price with a execellent track record. 

China Mobile-CHL. There is more growth in China than any where else in the world today. CHL is a "relatively" conservative way to play the Chinese market.

Canon-CAJ.  An outstanding Japanese company with solid growth prospects and Japan appears to be turning around.  

Conoco-Philips-COP.  An oil stock, only one of many.  However, if the price of oil drops below $50 a barrel within the next 3 years, you will loose money. That might occur in the event of a financial collapse due to a snowball of mortgage defaults.  A good possiblity. 

If that does occur, your only safe bet is T-bills which currently pay 4.7% for 6 mo.</td>

<td>what are trade unions?</td>
<td>A group of workers that organize to form a powerful barganing tool against upper and middle mangement.  Basically, workers at a company who do all of one type of work, lets say fixing planes, will all join a union of plane fixers.  They will then go to their bosses and make demands (More money, safer work, better benifits ...)  If the managers refuse to negociate, lets say ABC Airlines, all the plane fixers will go on strike.  In most cases the unions stick together, so if the plane fixers go on strike, the baggage handlers will go on strike, and the piolits will go on strike and so on.  Basically shutting down the Airline.  Management will have a risk return choice.  Meet the demands or stop offering service to customers.  Most times management and Union reps will sign contracts that last 2 - 5 years.  These contracts say we will do this and pay that if you agree to this and that.  Unions have to be careful because if they make irrational demands (like a million dollars a person a day) management will simply reject the propasal and hire non union people.

I feel Unions are good and bad.  It makes sure big business doesn't screw its workers, but it also limits free trade.  Most Union contracts say every person gets paid the same and hireing or firing a Union guy must be approved by Union leaders.  This makes it difficalt for a company to expand or contract their labor force in times of economic boom or recessions.  Today the United Auto Workers are in talks with Ford and GM over laying off several thousand workers.  From the point of the workers, the UAW is making sure they don't get screwed (Bob worked for Ford for 20 years and now 3 years before retirement they are laying him off).  The UAW will make sure Bob gets a decent severance package and pention that he earned.  From the point of Ford, they are loosing tons of money, that is why the need to lay people off.  By forcing Ford to pay severance and pention and alomost twice as much per worker per hour than Toyota, Ford will probably have to go into bankruptcy.  This will not only hurt the UAW worker at Ford, but also the janators and office workers and welders and so on who are not going to get the big severance package and will probably be the first to loose their petions.</td>

I don't think you should worry about percentages at this point.  Just get into good habits and commit to gradually increasing the amount you save as you earn more.  With time on your side, every extra dollar will have a huge impact, so use that as a motivator.

I'd also suggest you invest as aggressively as you can stand.

1) You want to take possession. If you have a few bucks that you want to put into gold, check out a site like
http://www.tulving.com/goldbull.html
(note - I am not connected with the company at all other than being a satisfied customer). Buy any of their pure bullion pieces, I believe that Maple Leafs and Pandas are both 0.9999 pure. Prices quoted include insured shipping. The downside here is that you have to buy over $10,000 at a time.

If you are looking for smaller quantities, try a coin store. Look for one that has been there for quite a while (more than 15 years), and talk to them about buying gold. If you get a good feeling, then try buying some.

2) If you don't need to take physical possession, try Perth Mint Certificates:
https://online.kitco.com/pmcp/
You will get a piece of paper stating your ownership of the gold, which will be held by the Perth Mint in Australia. $10,000 US is the minimum initial purchase price. The gold is fully guaranteed by the government of Australia.

<td>Is it safe to invest in money market?</td>
<td>Money markets a simply bonds with short maturity, meaning (usually)government  bonds that will expire in (usually) less than one year.
Not like regular bonds they are almost independently connected to the expected rate return of the period that the security will expire. In "regular" bonds there is also the risk factor (the "default" risk) where higher risk leads to higher yield but in money markets this is almost not a factor because these bonds are usually with very small risk (because of their short period to execution and because they are usually government bonds).
In money markets there are no "coupons". The price you pay is a beet less than 100 and the money you receive in the end of the period is 100. The difference is the return rate (in rough calculation)
The bottom line: YES, IT IS VERY SAFE</td>

<td>Wind energy is actually growing at a double digit rate, albeit from a very small percentage of the energy total.  Like solar and geothermal it's about as green as energy can get, so it is very responsible in that sense.   It will take strong government committment to spur it's use because it's still rarely competitive with fossil-based energy.   The Wall Street Journal had an article last week about the difficulty of the boldest experiment yet - a Danish island that has tried with limited success to get off shore wind energy as the primary source (it was going OK until the government withdrew subsidies).</td>

<td>what is a bankers draft?</td>
<td>A document similar to a cheque but drawn on the bank (or building society ) itself against a cash deposit. 

A bankers draft is thought of as being a secure way of receiving money where the payer's own cheque might not be honoured and where it's not convenient or desirable to receive cash.  

Commonly used for large purchases such as homes and cars.

It is similar to a cheque except the money has already been debited from your account - giving the payee the satisfaction that payment is guaranteed.

You must give notice to the bank that you require a banker's draft (usually 24 hours) so that they can prepare the draft and check that you have enough money in your account. There may also be a small fee to pay for issuing a banker's draft. 

On picking up the bankers draft from your bank, the amount is immediately debited from your account.

When the creditor deposits the banker's draft in their account, they will be credited the stated amount (which has already been debited from your bank account).

1 You contact the bank (with 24 hours notice) to request a banker's draft for the required amount
2 On agreement, the bank processes your request and produces the banker's draft
3 You visit the bank and collect the banker's draft in addition to paying a small administration fee
4 The amount is debited from your bank account
5 You give the banker's draft to the payee
6 They deposit the banker's draft into their account which is credited with the stated amount</td>

<td>the best hyip program that can be trusted?</td>
<td>I personally invest in HYIPs

There are NO safe HYIPs long term, so you can't expect to put money in a HYIP that is safe and secure and then collect in 20 years from now.

Most reliable HYIPs crash within 3-5 years after being started, it's just the nature of the investment.

Making money in HYIPs has almost noting to do with selecting the best HYIP. What you need to do is go to HYIP rating sites (example listed below) - these let you know basic info about a HYIP.

I suggest you start with $100 - $500 in trading capital. Then find HYIPs that seem reliable. Split that investment in multiple HYIPs so maybe you put $50 in each HYIP. If a few crash but some of them survive, you will still make a lot of money.

Your first goal is to get your initial investment out. I suggest that you let your HYIP grow for 30-60 days. Then begain slowly removing money from your HYIPs.  Take that money and put it back into your bank account with 10% interest. Now you have no risk.  Any additional money that you earn from your HYIP, take some money out for yourself as positive cashflow and take some of the money and invest it in other HYIPs.

You must have a business plan for investing in HYIPs. The key is not getting angry if 3 out of your 20 HYIPs go under, but your first goal should be to get your initial money back so that you have an asset that will produce money without any risk.

Diversification works great with HYIPs.

One last tip - don't invest in HYIPs that give more than 1-5% daily.  The 250% a day/week hyips are ALL scams. Don't be greedy, use your head.

I am using http://www.solidinvestment.com and http://www.vascoinvestment.com I can see both of these HYIPs being around for atleast the next 3-5 months.

Good Luck</td>

<td>how can i get emigration to canada?</td>
<td>Don't. Most emigrants to Canada are miserable. You will not find a job in Canada. I will refer you to a website made by immigrants to Canada. Aim for America.You'll earn more. Canadians only want immigrants to pay for their free healthcare.

In fact, I will copy some of things they say after I write this sentence.


 (FROM THE LINK BELOW)


 8. Discriminatory and Dishonest Immigration System.
      Immigration to Canada is based on a point system, obtained with your education, qualifications and job experience. Points are good enough for immigration, but in Canada, they are not good enough to get a job in your field. Amazing, how the credentials that qualify you to come to Canada are the same credentials that don't qualify you for your profession in Canada. The reason is, Canada only wants immigrants to do the labor jobs - pizza delivery, driving taxis, factory work etc.

 7. Out Of Control Cost Of Living.
      From rent, to utility bills, to shopping, to phone, internet and cable bills, to gas, to car insurance, to eating out, to basically anything you have to pay for or buy, the cost of living in Canada has become astronomical. Recent immigrants are astonished as to how expensive everything is. It is estimated that compared to most countries around the world, the cost of living in Canada is on average five times greater.

6. Health Care Crisis.
      Practicing physicians in Canada are in a shortage, 1 in 4 Canadians cannot get a family doctor. Canadian doctors are leaving to move permanently to the United States. Statistics Canada and the Canadian Medical Association both have identified that for every 1 American doctor that moves to Canada, 19 (nineteen) Canadian doctors move to the United States! Doctors in Canada are overworked and underpaid, and there is a cap on their salaries.

5. Very High Taxes.
      Yes, you have the GST, the PST, totaling 15%, on practically everything you purchase and many other taxes taken out of our weekly paycheck. You have to pay a whopping amount to the government, out of your hard earned salary, so that the government can turn around and give it to beer drinking, hockey watching welfare bums. Fair? It does not matter, it's Canada.

4. Money Hungry Government.
      Canadian Embassies around the world lie to foreigners, painting this picture that Canada is Utopia, because they want them to come to Canada. Why? Because foreigners bring money! So after being deceived, these foreigners come. They must bring with them at least $10,000. Canada has an immigration quota of 250,000 per year. So please do the math, 250,000 multiplied by $10,000 each equals a whopping 2.5 Billion dollars that Canada gains from immigrants every year.

3. No Culture.
      Unlike almost every other country in the world, Canada has no culture. Actually American culture is what dominates Canada. When was the last time you had some 'Canadian' food? There are no Canadian traditions and there is no national identity. What does it even mean to call yourself a 'Canadian'. . .nothing really. People living in Canada, still identify themselves with the country they 'originally' came from.

 2. Worst Weather.
      Yes, Canada has the worst weather conditions of any country in the world. Freezing cold temperatures, snow, ice, hail, winds, storms etc. From the Prairie provinces to the Maritimes, from the Territories to southern Ontario, the weather is so horrific and disgusting that many Canadians leave Canada simply because of this reason alone.

 1. No Jobs.
      Yes, coast to coast, there are no jobs. Immigrants are highly qualified (MD's, PhD's, Lawyers, Engineers etc.) but they are driving taxi cabs, delivering pizza's or working in factories. Even people with bachelors degrees from Canadian Universities cannot find jobs after graduation. This is the tragedy associated with immigration to Canada. I feel sorry for those immigrants who are stuck</td>

<td>Does anyone know a good Forex MA crossover technique with exit strategy that avoids whipsaw?</td>
<td>Avoiding whipsaw really is dependent on the time period you are trading. Several hundred pip moves preceeded by a head fake are common in short periods on the Forex after large news events. These are hard to predict and often correct themselves within a day or even in the next trading session.

MACD (and moving average)  is a good signal in Forex trading, but is not really a leading indicator, which is why some black box software packages that rely on it are so unprofitable for most of the users (if that software was so good, why would they be selling it instead of trading). MACD is only useful when combined with other technical indicators, such as many chart patterns, and candlesticks as well. Often in Forex, by the time the MACD changes trend, the trade is already in a loss. Again, this is very much dependent on your time frame, and with most trading interfaces you can adjust the settings on your MACD to better fit your trade.

http://www.fxstreet.com/education/a34.asp

As for recommendations on learning more about MACD, I would suggest Peter Bain's course. His website looks a little hokey to me, but I have seen his materials and taken courses from some of his instructors and found them to be both honest and worthwile. 
http://www.forexmentor.com/

You might also want to pose this question on some of the Yahoo user groups related to Forex. There are large numbers of active traders that will be willing to give you their two cents on MACD and moving averages.</td>

Volume can help determine the health of an existing trend. A healthy up-trend should have higher volume on the upward legs of the trend, and lower volume on the downward (corrective) legs. A healthy downtrend usually has higher volume on the downward legs of the trend and lower volume on the upward (corrective) legs.</td>

<td>Hi - I'm a trader...Highest Return?

Stocks won't because they require you to put forward the full amount of capital. Hedge Funds - you have little control over what they invest in - and i doubt they can match any professional trader's returns! 

You're left with futures/forex and options. I don't have experience with futures so I can't comment but forex dealers give you a leverage of 100:1. You only need to put in 1% of capital in your trading. What does that mean?? well percentage wise your returns will be phenonemal. You can achieve the same leveraged affect with options as well as this instrument called CFDs.</td>

<td>Is Google's valuation more inflated than Yahoo's?</td>
<td>According to Yahoo finance: GOOG's PE is 50 with a PEG (PE to earnings growth ratio) of 2.25.  The same statistics for YHOO are 48 and 2.4, making the two stocks fairly comparable in these respects.  In addition, GOOG has less short interest than YHOO at present.  One major difference is that YHOO is more mature than GOOG and provides earnings guidance, making their stock movements likely less volatile.  Alternatively, the general expectation for GOOG is faster growth and penetration into new market segments for growth.  So, is GOOG overpriced now?  Probably not based on growth metrics, but clearly GOOG has higher expectations (at least prior to yesterday) and is more expensive than YHOO on fundamental valuation.  Both have good prospects in the long-term.</td>

<td>Low Price Stock Trading - massive activity - question?</td>
<td>&gt;&gt;How, with only 10 billion shares outstanding, can XXX be so actively traded at this volume and why would XXX sit at the same price and trade billions of shares, when all press and reports about the company are positive?

The market is at a price consensus or is in a consolidation phase. The bulls and bears are in consensus; no one is more powerful than the other.

You will also find that penny stocks are usually less volatile than bigger value stocks.

&gt;&gt;My take is that someone is deliberately swapping shares, huge chunks at a time, at ridiculously low prices to keep the stock price down? Why go to the expense?

No I doubt anyone would be doing that deliberately. There is no point to such exercise - waste of time and money.

Maybe people who bought earlier at a cheaper price are taking profits and people who are hearing the news are buying in.

<td>what is leverage in stock trading?</td>
<td>I concur with the first 2 responders.  There is however a way you can use leverage without borrowing money. I am reporting this only to complete the answer.  I am not recommending it.  That is to buy calls or puts, especially out of the money calls and puts. It is best illustrated by an example.

Devon Oil trades at say about $62 a share. I am guessing.
You can purchase an April call at $65 for $5. Another guess.
If Devon goes to $75 before the April expiration your call will be worth $10. You will have doubled your money whereas if you had purchased the stock you would have only increased your money by 21%. That is leverage.  You, however, will have noticed that if Devon does not rise to $70 by the expiration date, you loose money. However, the price swings of options, especially options of volitile stocks such as the oil stocks can be dramatic.  Also the price drop of an option in relation to the price drop of the underlying stock is generally less on options with long expiration dates, but the price rise is generally greater. 

Lets say you bought the option for $5.00 tomarrow.  During the next five day Devon rises $5.00 a share to $67. That price swing has probably happened a dozen times during the last year. Your option will probably trade at $7.50, a 50% increase in a week. But the stock rose only 8%.</td>

<td>How does stock compound? I understand if it pays a dividend. How does a stock compound if it doesn't pay one?</td>
<td>Stock-price appreciation is not to be confused with compounding.  Compounding occurs when payouts are reinvested, such as in the case of dividend reinvestment.  The basics are that well established companies pay a dividend, and new companies do not because they would rather reinvest their earnings into the company to fund future growth. That is what the street wants...Growth! The price of a stock today is based on its future earnings (or at least what investors hope will be future earnings).  In the end, if you as an investor think that a company will 
never pay a dividend, then Modern Portfolio Theory will tell you that that is a stock not worth owning.  So for a stock to compound, you need that dividend reinvested into the same stock, and again, that is not to be confused with price appreciation.</td>

<td>What is the difference between investing after-tax dollars in my 401K versus investing the money in a Roth IRA</td>
<td>The difference is going to be when you take distributions.  The following assumes that you don't take withdrawals until you are 59 1/2. In the 401k, the after tax contributions will not be taxed when they are withdrawn.  When you withdraw the gains on the after tax dollars, they will be taxed as ordinary income.  Also, when you turn 70 1/2 you will have to take out required minimum distributions.

In the Roth IRA all distributions (contributions + gains) are withdrawn tax free.  At 70 1/2 there are no required minimum distributons.

If you qualify, the Roth is obviously the better vehicle.  Keep in mind that the Roth 401k has now been approved by the government and companies will start rolling them out soon.</td>

If a revaluation results in an increase in value, it should be credited to equity under the heading "revaluation surplus" unless it represents the reversal of a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised as an expense, in which case it should be recognised as income.

<td>What is a segregated fund?</td>
<td>Segregated Funds combine the growth potential of mutual funds with the security of insurance. When you invest in a segregated fund, you are actually buying an insurance contract. The money from each contract is then invested in an underlying mutual fund. While you don’t own units of the mutual fund, the returns of your segregated fund will closely track those of the underlying mutual fund. 

Segregated funds come with guarantees designed to protect your money from market volatility. Depending on your chosen level of protection, you are guaranteed that you will get back up to 75-100% of your investment, regardless of how markets perform. Following your 10-year term to maturity or upon your death, you or your beneficiaries will receive either the guaranteed amount or the market value of your investment, whichever is greater.

Like mutual funds, you can buy and sell segregated funds at any time. However, if you sell prior to the maturity date, you will receive the market value, which may be less than your original investment.

Some segregated funds include a “reset” feature, which allows the investor to lock in investment gains and reset the minimum guaranteed amount at a higher level.</td>

<td>Has anyone ever invested in Tax Liens?</td>
<td>YOU CAN INVEST IN THEM. Because the lien is placed on the propery it overrides a mortgage. So if a person is paying their mortgage but not paying their property taxes, their propery can be taken from them for little money. Depending on the type of property they have up to 2 1/2 years to pay the taxes owed.(Check for differences in your state) It depends how you want to invest. Im not sure about the laws in your state. But i usually look for properties that are either abandoned or close to the redemption period. If the property is too good to lose then purchase it at the beginning of a sale. There should be a listing in the papers or if you see a property you have interest you can look up its info at your city hall treasurer's recorders office. There are usually lots of steps to take but for the little amount that you probably invest and how much the property is worth its a good deal. 

If the property is close to the end of the redemption period and not vacant, and you dont want to do a hostile take over you can still do a quit claim deed and retrieve and try to work something out with the occupants. This way you dont have to kick them out clean up or possibly fix up if the property needs too much of TLC. They can continue to pay you for living there either rent to own or rent. There are sooo many things that you can do. Mostly popular in larger cities and some bad neighborhoods. But if you have the will you can make easy money.</td>

These plans are offered as an employment incentive, giving you an opportunity to share in the growth potential of your company's stock (and, by implication, work hard to keep the stock price soaring).

Usually, you make contributions to a stock purchase fund for a certain period of time through payroll deductions. At designated points in the year, your employer then uses the accumulated money in the fund to purchase stock for you.

In many plans, the price that you pay for the stock is the stock price at the time you started contributing to the fund, or the stock price at the time you purchased the shares (whichever is lower) with a discount of up to 15 percent. Either way, you get to buy the stock at a price that's lower than the market price. Your discounted price is known as the offer or grant price, because your employer has offered it to you, or granted it to you."

<td>How do you put knowledge on the balance sheet?</td>
<td>Yes, you don't.  It is an expense and for a good reason.  If you have one employee who has a useful skill, then the imputed value of that knowledge really belongs to that one person.  If they die or leave, it goes with them.  If it is widespread knowledge, then it likely has no value.  If it is widespread knowledge, then it really only has value if you can put a moat around it so no one can take it, such as through a patent.  Accounting wasn't designed to impute value to non-permanent assets.  The firm doesn't really own the know-how of its workers.  It continues to exist only as long as you can maintain continuity within staffing knowledge.  It is an expense, the managerial challenge is to turn that expense into value.  Training has been shown, if properly done, to have around a 600% ROI.

I used to do a lot of training of IT Teams in project management technique.  It is a tough group because it has to be practical and useful without them needing to make the leap.  It is worth it.  Don't play games with your balance sheet.  Mark training as a specific expense so investors can value it as an asset.</td>

<td>XYZ corporation is considering a proposal to tool up for productionof a new product.the intial outlay will be?</td>
<td>Your question is worded in a way that indicates that XYZ corp.  will not have any cash flows for the last(7th) year but only a salvage value for year 7.  So I'll perform the problem with cash flows only comming from years 1-6.

To determine if this investment should be pursued, we must determing the investments Net Present Value.  That is the present value of inflows minus present value of outflows.
NPV=PV of inflows - PV of outflows

•At the end of year 1, XYZ will receive 240K.  Discount this back 1 year at the cost of capital, 15%, and the present value is $208,695.65.
•At the end of year 2, XYZ will receive 240K.  Discount this back 2 years at the cost of capital, 15%, and the present value is $181,474.48
•At the end of year 3, XYZ will receive 240K.  Discount this back 3 years at the cost of capital, 15%, and the present value is $157,803.90
•At the end of year 4, XYZ will receive 240K.  Discount this back 4 years at the cost of capital, 15%, and the present value is $137,220.78
•At the end of year 5, XYZ will receive 240K.  Discount this back 5 years at the cost of capital, 15%, and the present value is $119,322.42
•At the end of year 6, XYZ will receive 240K.  Discount this back 6 years at the cost of capital, 15%, and the present value is $103,758.62
•At the end of year 7, XYZ will only receive 100K for the salvage.  Discount this back 7 years at the cost of capital, 15%, and the present value is $37,593.70

Sum these present values to find the PV of inflows
Sum = $945,869.55

The present value of outflows is your initial outlay of $850,000.

PV of inflows - PV of outflows = NPV
  $945,869.55 - $850,000  =  $95,869.55   

This investment should be undertaken.  Inflows are greater than your outflow.  If NPV was a negative number, the investment would not be profitable and XYZ would not only never recoup their initial investment amount, but it end up costing the amount the NPV was negative.</td>

He advises looking for undervalued property that will bring in rent that is more than the cost of the mortgage, property tax, insurance, and maintenance costs (i.e. "positive cash flow"). Such properties have become increasingly difficult to find during the real estate mania of the past few years. Don't buy property that is cash-flow negative in hopes of appreciation - that is gambling, not investing.

<td>how to do a financial analysis on intel and amd?</td>
<td>You are smart to consider each company's future rather than their past.

Here is a down and dirty analysis from a growth oriented trader:

INTC / AMD
Cur Qtr EPS GRWTH  -22.9% / 825%
Nxt Qtr EPS GRWTH -18.2% / 833%
Debt/Equity 0.067 / 0.41
Return on Equity  23.18 / 5.2%
Fwrd PE Dec '07 14.54 / 22.10        
Profit Margin 22.32% / 2.83%

Intel and AMD are very different companies. Notice Intel's profit margin is far higher than AMD. Also notice it's debt and return on equity are much stronger than AMD.

In the most recently reported earnings from Intel, they missed EPS guidance that they had provided only weeks prior. This disappointed investors and has forced Intel shares down near 52 weeks lows.

At the same time AMD reported excellent earnings. This has led to a number of upward EPS revisions for AMD and a number of downward EPS revisions for INTC.

There are a number of other stocks in the semiconductor space who are younger with more robust earnings and higher margin products. Some companies include: Intersil, Marvel, Broadcom, Sandisk. These stocks have all made good moves in the past few months, so be very careful, as with all investment decisions.</td>

<td>Start small. Set aside a portion of cash/savings you are willing to risk. It is highly unlikely you will much or all of its value, especially if you invest in a large corporation like Coca Cola or Anheuser Busch. Buy a book or books (or research on the Web) 'How to Invest in the Stock Market" so you become familiar w/ investing terms. 
  Open an account w/ a broker such as E-Trade or Ameritrade, its easier than you think, and transfer the money into the account. Its free and I am pretty sure that uninvested money earns interest (not much 2-3%). Now where these brokers make their money is when you buy and sell stocks. E-Trade charges 14.99 for each trade regardless if its 1 stock or 100, so be careful, especially if your nor investing a whole lot of money, you don't lose your 'profit' to commissioning fees. If you buy stock you should carefully research the company you are buying into and be prepared to hold on to that stock for the long term. Short term fluctuations in the stock (especially losses) can make you nervous and may make you want to 'cut your losses'. Stick with your choice. 
  I was like you about the Stock Market. The majority of my investments are in mutual funds and bonds. I invest in the market as a 'hobby', its fun to track your stocks and try to beat out the big guys. I have made money over the last few years (still gotta keep the day job though) and have learned a few lessons the hard way.
  1) Don't 'risk' more than your comfortable with to start. If you can't sleep because your worried about your Yahoo stock, your in too deep.
  2) Open a brokerage account. If you are really nervous use an established brokerage house like TD Waterhouse or Merrill Lynch, though they want a large opening stake, usually around $5G, to open an account. They will offer advice on stocks but the brokers don't always have YOUR best interest in mind. I use E-Trade and read the Wall Street Journal (because I'm cheap and think I know it all).
  3) Have fun and Good Luck!

If you are maxing your 401k, the Roth IRA is a good idea, assuming you fall within income limits. Also, if your employer will listen, as of January 1st employers can add the Roth 401k to their exisiting plans. Ask them about adding it.

If you cannot qualify for the Roth, or max it out and still want to put money away for retirement, consider a non-qualified variable annuity.

If you also need life insurance, you might consider over-funding a variable universal life insurance policy.

<td>what is margin trading in stocks?</td>
<td>Margin trading is buying stock with someone else's money. Typically, it works like this.

You put $1000 in a broker's margin account. You can buy up to $1500 in stocks. The extra $500 (50% of your amount) is being loaned to you by the broker. And yes, you will pay interest on that loan.

The trick is picking stocks that will outperform the interest rate. If the stock goes up, you can greatly increase your income. If it goes down, you lose more also. Plus, if you lose too much, you will have to sell off some of the stock (at a loss) in order to keep yourself with only a certain amount of debt (typically 50%). This is known as a margin call.

Having tried this, it is tricky. You can make a lot and you can lose a lot. I traded on margin for about a year and did both.</td>

<td>Highest Potential Returns?  Trading Futures, Options, Forex, or CFD's?  Why?</td>
<td>Hi - I'm a trader...Highest Return?

Stocks won't because they require you to put forward the full amount of capital. Hedge Funds - you have little control over what they invest in - and i doubt they can match any professional trader's returns!

You're left with futures/forex and options. I don't have experience with futures so I can't comment but forex dealers give you a leverage of 100:1. You only need to put in 1% of capital in your trading. What does that mean?? well percentage wise your returns will be phenonemal. You can achieve the same leveraged affect with options as well as this instrument called CFDs.</td>

<td>How do I figure out how many shares of a stock can I buy for any given amount, w/o actually buying them?</td>
<td>The answer is by using simple mathematics.

First you need to decide how much of each stock you are going to buy - since not all stocks are priced equally some would be $20, other $400 and some 0.05 cents.

$100,000 over ten stocks... Decide what ratio you will hold of each stock. E.g. 6:3:4:1:9:4:3:7:9:2

So totalling the ratio is 48. Now you can use a combination of the ratios and fractions to find out how much stock you can hold with your $100,000.

I may have left you out on a limb there - but this calculation is uneccessary. Why don't you just buy your stock one by one until you run out of money? :P

OK Lets try the example with 2 stocks and $100K
you want the weighting to be 3:4
so you want 
3/7ths of your money to go to 1 stock
4/7ths of your money to go to 1 stock

3/7*100K=$42857.14
4/7*100K=$57142.85

Now say stock ZXC was $5 each and stock ABC was $67

Now you go:
$57142.85/$67=852.88 Stocks
$42857.14/$5=8571.43 Stocks

There you go. Now do the similar calculation with your ten stocks! Haha!

Good Luck!</td>

<td>how does stock market works?</td>
<td>It's easy.
You sell a part of your business to investors.

Let's say your chicken recipe tastes great and everybody likes it but you don't have $100,000.00 to open your own restaurant.
You talk to your neighbours, to your friends, to your mother and you sell 100 shares of your new restaurant for $1000.00 each.
Your mother buys 50 shares and you invest all your savings of $25,000.00 and 25 others invest for a total of 100 shares.
You now have 27 investors (Including yourself)

You open your new Restaurant it's called Kentucky Fried Chicken and everybody loves it.

After a while you realize you need to open another location and you now need another $100,000.00 but so far the profits are just $50,000.00 and not everybody wants to invest in your new location because it may not work like the first one. On the other hand, neighbours that did not wanted to invest in your first location now they want to make a lot of money too with your recipe and they want to invest in your Chain.
You decide to offer 200 shares this time but at $2,000 each.
This raises $400,000.00 (Enough for 4 new locations)
However, after your ad on the newspaper you get over 800 investors interested in your new Kentucky Fried Chicken Chain.
That's when the price of your shares starts to go up.
There is demand but not enough shares for everybody.
Some investors decide to BUY shares from the original investors for $4000.00 and your mother and yourself decide to keep all your shares.
If your business is making money everybody wants a piece of it and the price goes up. If nobody wants your business the price goes down.

That's pretty much how the stock market works. 
Some people are selling and some people are buying. If they buy the price goes up if they sell the price goes down.
Remember, the number of shares are always the same and limited. (Unless the company decides to sell more shares, which is very rare)
If the number of sellers were the same as the number of buyers the stock price would be the same.

Now Kentucky Fried Chicken has millions of shareholders.

I hope this helps.

<td>what are some risk management techniques for pension funds?</td>
<td>Risk Management is NOT about getting constant (i.e. low volatiliy) returns.
Risk Management is NOT about getting risk with complete certainty.

As Mark Twain said: predicting is difficult, but it is more difficult to predict the future.

Risk Management is about getting rich enough with as much uncertainty as you feel confortable with. 

The first step towards risk management for pension funds is knowing the explicit or implied fund's liabilities:
is it a defined benefit fund? then it's quite easy to determine the liabilities. 

Is it defined contribution? Then still the fund has, on behalf of the benefitial owners, liabilities to deal with, although they are not explicit and thus are more difficult to be sought after.

You should pursue two different (and at most times contrarian) objectives:
first, maximize the expected surplus of the fund, AFTER the liabilities have been paid.

Second, minimize the VARIANCE of the difference between the liabilities and the assets plus the future contributions to the plan.
That is, you should, on hand 
maximize e=(X-B)'E
where X is the Asset Portfolio, B is the portfolio representing the future flows for the fund (i.e. contributions and withdrawals), E is a vector of expected returns for each asset or flow;
and on the other hand
minimize V=VAR{(X-B)'E}
[Note: if X and B are deterministic and E is multinormal, then V= (X-B)'S(X-B) where S ithe covariance matrix for E]

It should be more than obvius that both function are ,generally speaking, not optimal in the same place. Thus, you need a PREFERENCE FUNCTION.
It's usual to have U=e-lV where l is the risk-aversion coefficient.
Depending on how you model your assets and your flows, the function can turn out to be analytically treatable, or you might end up using some kind of simulation

It rather depends upon the circumstances.  If a stock fails to meet listing a number of things happen.  First, it may no longer be possible to buy or sell the stock.  Second, if you can buy the stock, there no longer will be a ticker for the stock.  It has a symbol, but the trades are no longer tracked.

<td>What is better for the individual investors, stocks, bonds, or mutual funds?</td>
<td>Stocks, bonds and mutual funds all have different risk / reward profiles. Each is suited to being put to work achieving different goals as part of a financial plan.

Stocks are suitable for investors with at least 15 years before they will need the money. Short term losses are to be expected. Constant research and market watching is necessary if you are going to own individual stocks. 

Mutual funds, index funds, hedge funds and ETFs give investors with a long term time horizon opportunity to take part in the growth that stocks (bonds too) offer with professional management. There are timing systems for mutual funds and ETFs as well.

Bonds can be risky. The quality of the issuer is extremely important. It is entriely possible to have short term losses in a rising interest rate enviroment. Moody's and Standard and Poors offer bond rating services. Money market instruments are the "safest" investments available. Bonds and money market instruments are suitable tools for building plans achieving shorter term goals that do not have many years to ride out volatility.

<td>These are very difficult to answer without seeing the offering documents. Is the investment professionally managed? Do you have any documentation at all? Brazil is not the most corrupt country, in general, but even to in the US you can lose land if the title is flawed, hence title insurance. Additional risks include land quality and currency conversion. Often times, Brazilian farmland has a low nutrient base and little topsoil. Also, the investment may do well in local BRL terms but if the currency depreciated against the USD then you could end up losing money.</td>

China is growing a lot faster than the US, BUT its growth is very much dependent on the US. That is why they do not dump all the US paper they own, because they do not want the value of the dollar to collapse. 

Several Chinese companies are relatively good values, compared to Indian companies for example and compared to US companies. 

You can invest in many Chinese companies directly by purchasing their stocks on the NYSE and also through buying both open ended and closed end mutual funds.</td>

<td>What is the relation between the risk and the interest in money and banking?  thanks?</td>
<td>The main risk in backing is opportunity cost.  Example
If you put $1,000 in a saving account that is FDIC insured the risk would be 0, but the interest rate would be low as well. If you put $1,000 in a corporate bond or an uninsured CD, your risk would be higher, but so would the interest rate.  The higher the risk, the higher the return should be.

The opportunity cost associated with the lower risk is how much return you could have gotten had you choosen a riskier investment.

1,000 in savings = 2 % a year later risk free
1,000 in CD = 5 % a year later with relativly low risk
1,000 in Corrporate Bond= 7.5% a year later with medium risk
1,000 in Blue Chip Stock= 10% a year later with higher risk
1,000 in tech Stock = 14 % a year later with a chance you could loose all invested moneys.

<td>what happens when a stock splits?</td>
<td>Great question. First, let's clarify why they happen, then how they work, and finally I'll explain what that means to you.

A company will normally 'split their stock' when they believe that the price of that stock is higher than what smaller investors are willing to pay. In other words, they think their stock is just too expensive and isn't very attractive any more. A stock split is simply an attempt to make their stock more attractive to the smaller investor.

At that point the company decides to split their stock. Usually they split it in half, but occasionally there will be a 3 to 1 or 4 to 1 split, or even more. They drop the price of their stock by 1/2 (assuming in this case it is a 2 to 1 split) and then double the shares assigned to each current stockholder. For example, if you own 100 shares of 'Cafez Inc.' at one dollar each, and that company announces a split of 2 to 1, then suddenly you have 200 shares worth fifty cents each. 

What this means for you is nothing; initially. When you had 100 shares worth $1.00 each you had $100.00 worth of shares. Now that you have 200 shares worth $0.50 each you STILL have only $100.00.

The benefit (or loss) comes later, when the price of the stock changes. Let's assume two examples. The first one you don't see a stock split, but some months later the price of each share increases by $1.00. Your 100 shares are now worth $200.00! Great!

But in the second example let's assume the stock splits 2 to 1 today and you have 200 shares at $.050 each. That's still $100.00 total investment right now. But in a few months the price of each share increases by $1.00 again. Now each share is worth $1.50, making your total stock ownership worth $300.00. 

Of course the benefit is almost never that drastic, but in the long term is usually much better for the investor if the stock splits than if it doesn't. It also brings in more investors which brings in more money for the company, allowing them to invest that new money into new stores, factories, products, or ideas that can generate even more money for them. This, in turn, will likely increase the value of your stock.

I hope this answer helps you out! If you have any further questions please feel free to ask.</td>

<td>Is this US Dinar investing a fraud?</td>
<td>It may not be illegal but it is certainly high risk. Since the dinar is not traded freely but instead has an essentially fixed exchange rate, the chance of making any short term profit are very close to zero.  Further, for now you cannot exchange Iraqi dinars on the currency exchange market (outside of Iraq) so the money only has value inside Iraq. No bank outside of Iraq will exchange this currency for you so it is for all practical purposes worthless. Most of the dinar currency being sold in the US is being smuggled out or Iraq by entrepreneurial types that are taking advantage of uninformed speculators. 

Here's the link to the Central Bank of Iraq currency auction:
http://www.cbiraq.org/cbs6.htm

Today's price for the dinar is 1477 dinar to the US dollar. That is a change of 1 dinar, from 1476 from the rate the dinar was trading at in the Central Bank of Iraq about two years ago when the Coalition began exchanging dinars for dollars. The exchange has to exist because so much American money is being spent there that they had to find a way to convert it to dinars. However, since the US contractors in Iraq have a significant need to keep the price of the dinar stable, you can bet it is not going to change anytime soon. The exchange basically exists so American contractors and some other foreign contractors can pay Iraqi subcontractors in dinars. 

The future value of the dinar is probably tied to the oil production of Iraq, as well as many actions that the Central Bank may take in the future to create lending and deposit accounts. Because of the instability in Iraq it is impossible for oil companies to drill for or explore for oil An oil well is too easily targeted to risk setting up oil rigs in Iraq now. Iraq's oil production is barely covering their own consumption at present, and much of the exports they are making are offset by importing refined products. Iraq's productiion has not even reached the level of production that existed before the war, and it may take a decade for the oil production in Iraq to recover to a beneficial level for the country. Oil production has a long lead time; often several years of planning go into drilling an oil well, and it can take months or years before new discoveries are productive. The dinar may be profitable in about 20 years, or it may follow the path of the Turkish lira, which reached about 2 million lira to the dollar before they recently revalued to eliminate all those zeros. Dinar investments may have more potential as collector's items with curiousity value than as a currency investment. Dinars may become something  like those stock certificates people hang on the walls.

By the way, I believe the old Iraqi currency probably has more potential for profit than the new currency because currency and coin collectors are likely to find them more difficult to acquire in good condition than the new currency which is commonly being hoarded by speculators.</td>

<td>Is it better to pay 5% sales commission up front or pay a 1% portfolio value management fee?</td>
<td>What you are talking about is a wrap fee account. Yes, the annual fee (charged quarterly) is assessed on the full balance of the account, but Trade_Info had an important point, although it wasn't the one he was trying to make. Since the fee is on the entire account, your advisor has a vested interest in the performance of the account. His income will go down if your account value goes down. If he only made money on the growth of your account, he wouldn't lose anything if you had a down year.

Also, a competent and ethical financial planner would not put you in A shares with an upfront fee only to mve the assets to a different fund family down the road. Assets need to be rebalanced, but transfers within a fund family do not incur additional charges. Also, if you are investing $100k+ you shouldn't be paying the full front end load on A shares. Ask your advisor about breakpoints.

Personally, I would recommend the wrap fee account. I'm not sure about Ameriprise (big commanies are usually less responsive to clients) but the fee amount could be negotiable, especially if there is the likelihood that you will be investing additional assets into the account down the road.

P.S. There is no such thing as a wrap fee account that assesses the fee only on the growth of the account.</td>

<td>How can you safely earn 10%?</td>
<td>You invest getting 5% per year for 2 years. ;-)

Risk and rate of return are a tradeoff. NEVER forget this point.

You will rarely, if ever, find a guaranteed investment that pays twice the going rate. If it were real, its price would be quickly bid up (since it is so attractive), and the rate of return would fall so that it will be in line with the rest of the market.

Higer rates of return are onlly possible in:

1) high risk situations (not safe by definition)
2) scams - even less safe
3) areas where additional work is required (say buing a rental property that requires maintenance)
4) very short-term trades - the professionals usually latch onto these ones before you will ever get a chance.</td>

The 1099 shows interest paid into your account for which you owe taxes in the year it was paid.

<td>What are your chances of making money?</td>
<td>Chances are good if you don't sell too often.  This strategy will make money in most years and your gains will be lightly taxed:  Buy stock in one solid company per month, not heavily hyped rockets like Google or distressed companies on the verge of bankruptcy but a happy medium like Lowe's home improvement stores.  Sell each stock after 1 year and replace with another promising stock.  

Almost any strategy will make money over the long run if it's applied consistently so that you're buying even during dips and selling even when it looks like the market will go to the moon.

If your plan is to trade every day or every week, then the odds are terrible.  Be ready for years of losses before you master that game.  You can try paper-trading to get a little taste of what short-term trading is like without risking real money.

I'm not touting Lowe's stock by the way.  It's just an example of a dependable, growing company.</td>

<td>during a stock market crash do all stocks go down? If so is that not a perfect time to by market leaders?</td>
<td>there is an old adage. Buy low. Sell high. And yes you are correct. That is the very best time to buy market leaders. I dissagree with one of the comments that only 2 out of 3 stocks fall.  It has been my experience that they all fall with maybe a very few exceptions. There are certain companies that are considered blue chips. A few examples are Microsoft, Proctor and Gamble, Budwieser, Exxon-Mobile.
During a crash stock values tend to drop a lot--70% is not uncommon.  There is a trick to investing during a crash and that is determining when stocks have hit bottom.  This is very difficult to do.  The crash of 1929 did not hit bottom until 1933 and then did not actually recover to the previous high until 1955 or thereabouts. Then in the mid 1960's it hit another high to which it did not recover until the mid 1980's.  It then went on a tear until it peaked in 2000. It has been consolidating ever since. The consolidation may last a LONG time. During the crash of 1972-1974, if I remember correctly, the average PE dropped from about 25 to about 8. A drop of 2/3.  December of 1974 was an excellent time to buy IBM. Back then IBM was the premier blue chip. Kodak was not far behind. Now they are not considered blue chips any more. Technology left them in the dust. 

During the crash of 1929, there were a lot of investors that thought that 1930 was a good time to jump into the stock market. They were sadly mistaken.  Stocks fell another 70% from 1930 to 1933.</td>

I will describe two.
1.  Buy stock in a company that you believe will outperform the market in general and sell short stock in a broad market index. If the stock market falls, you will be protected against the fall if in fact the market in general falls faster than the stock that you have purchased. 

2. Buy stock in a company in which stock options are traded 
and a) sell an in the money call at a premium b) sell an out of the money call c) buy an in the money put d) buy an out of the money put
a) by selling an in the money call you are pocketing the premium price of the call.  If the stock falls below the call price at or before the expiration date, you have pocketed the amount of the call and you still own the stock and you have protected yourself down to the price of the in the money call. If the price of the stock goes up, you do not gain that increase, the call holder does
b) with an out of the money call you will gain the price increase upto the call price plus the premium price of the call. Beyond that the call holder will gain the increase.
c) with an in the money put you will be completely protected against a fall in the price of the stock but you will pay a premium for that protection. If the price of the stock rises you will gain all the increase minus the cost of the put.
d) the same as above but you will not be completely protected only partially, but it will not cost so much.</td>

Remember that life is not the destination, it is the journey.  Reaching your goals will not bring happiness.  It is the striving for the goals that will make your life fulfilling.  As long as you are growing as a person, you will feel fulfilled.  When you stop growing, that is when your life becomes meaningless and empty.</td>

<td>Is Gold a good investment? How do you invest in gold?</td>

I would suggest 2. You won't have a bunch of gold lying around your house and you won't have to figure out which gold miners are good and which aren't. That being said, you still need to figure out what kind of index or fund you will buy, and that may take some research. I would also wait a little on gold, I think we will see a bit of a pullback.</td>

<td>what are the differences and similarities between NASDAQ and AMEX?</td>
<td>NASDAQ (originally an acronym for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations ) is a U.S. electronic stock market. It was founded by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) who divested it in a series of sales in 2000 and 2001. It is owned and operated by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. NASDAQ: NDAQ which was listed on its own stock exchange in 2002. NASDAQ is the largest electronic screen-based equity securities market in the United States. With approximately 3,300 companies, it lists more companies and, on average, trades more shares per day than any other U.S. market. The current chief executive is Robert Greifeld.

The American Stock Exchange (AMEX) is a stock exchange operated by American Stock Exchange LLC, a subsidiary of the NASD, in the United States of America.

he Exchange traces its roots back to colonial times when stock brokers created outdoor markets to trade new government securities. The AMEX started out as such a market at the curbstone on Broad Street near Exchange Place. The curb brokers gathered around the lamp posts and mail boxes, resisting wind and weather, putting up lists of stocks for sale. As trading activity increased, the shouting reached such a high level that special hand signals had to be introduced so that the brokers could continue trading. In 1921 the market was moved indoors into the building where it still resides, and the hand signals remained in place for decades even after the move.

In 1998, the American Stock Exchange merged with the National Association of Securities Dealers (operators of NASDAQ) to create "The Nasdaq-Amex Market Group" where AMEX is an independent entity of the NASD parent company.

Out of the three major American stock exchanges, the AMEX is known to have the most liberal policies concerning company listing, as most of its companies are generally smaller compared to the NYSE and NASDAQ. Located next to the World Trade Center, it was tragically affected by the September 11, 2001 attacks, but has recovered well since then.</td>

<td>what is a treasury bond?</td>
<td>a treasury bond is issued by the government as a method of raising capital to service government debt. when you buy a treasury bond you effectively become a creditor to the government. the yield of this bond (or note) is the annual percentage of the lent amount you receive in interest payments as the creditor.

various factors affect the yield of this note, such as whether or not the country issuing it is prone to political and/or economic volatility, investor confidence in the local currency and speculation about future economic development. domestic interest rates also affect the yield of a treasury bond.

as a general rule (as with all investment) the higher the risk or level of speculation, the higher the yield. for example, a recently issued 30 year (this is the timeframe in which the bond will continue to compound or pay its annuity) US treasury bond has a projected yield of 4.5% per year. in contrast, a Brazilian treasury bond has a yield of 15.4% because of mentioned risks.

treasury bonds can be bought and sold on the bond market, so an investor does not have to hold on to them for the entire length of their maturity.

because they are generally "safe" investments (as they are backed by the federal bank of an individual sovereign state) bonds become popular when speculative investor confidence is low. that is to say, when equities (or stocks) are down, bonds are up. and vice versa.</td>

There are several reasons they might do this.
1. They think the stock is undervalued, that is, a better investment than investing the money to expand the business.

2. To reduce the number of outstanding shares so the the earnings per share will be higher.  This makes it appear as though the company is growing earnings when in fact they are not.

3. They issue a lot of stock options to their executives and when the executive exercise the options, it increases the number of shares outstanding and reduces the earnings per share, so they buy the stock back on the open market to attempt to keep the number of shares outstanding fairly constant. This is similar to 2 but not exactly the same. Cisco is a good example of using this type of buy back.</td>

Most stocks trade at a multiple of earnings consistent with the rate of return a rational investor would expect to receive given the risks.  Investors also look at future returns and discount to present value.  So a big decline either means the company's future suddenly seems less bright or that something happened which made the company's present look much worse than previously thought.  Of course, there could be psychological factors too.  Or the company could have been simply overvalued.

Google seems to be a good recent case in point.  Shares have dropped from way over 400 to about 340 recently rebounding to the 360s.  Several factors.  Priced too high relative to profits, change in outlook owing to US  Government interventions, change in psychology owing to company's cooperation with Chinese government with censorship.  Also market predictions that company could lose 1/2 its value.  So many investors sold.  So the company's stock declined a great deal in a short time.

<td>best place in florida to buy real estate?</td>
<td>I've done some reading on this subject, and I also have a younger brother in Miami who has bought land down there, by Naples.  We discuss real estate often.
I was reading an article that said a lot of the people who have been living in South Florida for a long time are all starting to buy places up north.  The reason is that so many people have flooded into South Florida, it has lost the "ruralness" it had 20 years ago.  So, a lot of the long timers are looking to escape the boom that has taken place in South Florida. If I were looking to invest in Florida, I'd probably look more towards the north eastern part of the state.</td>

To answer your question, having a thorough biz plan is terrific - but you don't have to have it to get VC funding.

HYIP basically High Risk Investment that promise high returns .
As with other investments, high gain means high risk. Many HYIP programs were proven to be scams. Most of the scam HYIPs use the ponzi scheme, and they do not invest your money elsewhere. People call them SCAMS or Ponzi.

Therefore when most people heard of the term HYIP, they usually refer it as scams. They fear HYIPs. They are afraid to lose money. They are afraid of risk. They are losers in life.

So many HYIPs are ponzi! Why must we invest? and how we win ?

Ponzi? So what. As long as ponzi and scammers are around, we can make money. If you are afraid to lose money, leave HYIP arena. Losing money is the key and the gear to build a better investment diversification plan.

the key is : open your eyes, diversify...diversify...diversify and don't forget HYIP rules and strategy</td>

A wrap fee account is a type of brokerage account that allows the investor to purchase equities, bonds and even load funds without paying a trade commission or even the load on the fund. (Referred to as buying the fund at NAV or net asset value.) Instead the account is charged a "wrap fee" stated as a annual percentage (usually .5 to 1.25% depending on account size) and assessed quarterly.

Wrap fee accounts can be worthwhile for individuals that demand alot of flexibility in investment choices and exchanges. They also make asset rebalancing among load funds easier for your advisor.</td>

Second, Let's talk business, and that business is stocks. 
I want you to diversify.  what do this guy mean by diversify?  Good question.  Split your asset into at least three to five different sectors.  For example, you can put some on Technolology, Pharmacuetical drug company, Financial, Retailer, and energy or oil refineries.

Finally, research each of those sectors, and try to find a leader in each or everyone of them.  You can do this.  One of the way to look for is to read newspaper.  Investors Business Daily is good source to start.  I find them very useful compared to other newspaper like Wall Street Journal.

Keep post your question if you need further help.

<td>why is a long term zero cupon bond more sensitive to interest rates than a short-term one?</td>
<td>Because the future cash flow (the repayment) for a long-term zero coupon bond is discounted over a longer period of time. This will result in a greater fluctuation in price market interest rates change.

For example, assume bond A is a $100,000 zero coupon bond that matures in one year. Assume the bond is sold when market rates are 5%. This would mean that the bond price is about $95,238 (100,000/1.05). If, a few minutes after it was sold interest rates jumped to 10%, the bond price would fall to to $90,909 (100,000/1.10).

Assume that bond B is a $100,000 zero coupon bond that matures in 10 years. Assuming the same rates above, the bond would have a selling price of $61,391 (100,000/(1.05)^10). However, when rates rise to 10%, the bond's price would plummet to $38,554 (100,000/(1.10)^10).

Notice how much more sensitive the long-term bond is to changes in interest rates. Its price changes dramatically.</td>

sell on good news and buy on bad news...

<td>Can someone tell me the procedure of buying Equity Shares ??...i am a student .?</td>
<td>If you have to ask this question, I would recommend that you not even pursue this course until you have studied the existing options for investing.  If you are referring to buying stock commonly traded on an exchange, you have several options, none of which is advisable for a beginner, nor for someone who does not have already, considerable savings on hand, especially if you are a student.

If you are referring to buying equity shares in a private company, then that is a different matter altogether.  Unfortunately, as terminology can vary from country to country, and as you haven't provided many details, it is impossible to reliably advise you.

I will assume you are talking about buying "stocks" on an exchange.  If you are in the United States, one normally opens an account with a broker.  There are online brokers you can use like Scottrade, Ameritrade, etc.  Normally one fills out some paperwork and sends it in with a check/draft/wire deposit.  You can then buy and sell stocks through this broker.  You place an order on a stock, like GE for example, which the broker fills.  

I would experiment with this on quote.yahoo.com before doing it for real.  There are also lots of places you can turn to for investment advice.

A safer thing to do with your money if you are a student (at university if you are out of the house) is to put the money in savings, certificate of deposit, money market fund, or other low risk option.   An option many investors use to buy stock at slightly lower risk is called a mutual fund.  Research these options thoroughly.

Good luck.</td>

<td>what is the best investment, roth ira,traditional ira or 401K that doesnt contribute anything?</td>
<td>In a traditional IRA, the money is set aside tax free, but you pay taxes on the funds when you use them once you reach the designated age.  Also, you cannot take any funds from that account before age 59.5 years, or you'll pay stiff penalties. Further, there are strict rules about when you must withdraw and how much you must withdraw when you reach the eligible age.

In a Roth IRA, the money you set aside is taxable today, but you won't pay taxes years from now, when you need to withdraw the funds.  You can withdraw the funds you contribute (but not the income those funds earn) if you need them, without penalties.  The rules for when you can withdraw and how much you must withdraw are much more flexible than a traditional IRA.

I believe that Roth IRA option is not available to households above a certain income level.</td>

<td>what are the mutual funds ?</td>
<td>A mutual fund is a collection of some kind of investment, usually stocks. They’re extremely popular. Your parents own at least one mutual fund if they’ve ever worked at a company. Mutual funds work like this: You pick a fund you like (e.g., growth, value, technology, international…), buy shares of the fund, and let a money manager pick the stocks he thinks will yield the best return. In exchange for this diversification and his expertise, you pay an annual fee. 

Advantages: Hands-off approach means an expert money manager makes investment decisions for you. Mutual fund (ostensibly) holds many varied stocks, so if one company tanks, your fund doesn’t go down with it (i.e., it’s “diversified”).

Disadvantages: Annual fees can equal tens of thousands of dollars or more (!) over the lifetime of an investment. If you invest in two mutual funds, they may overlap in investments, yielding a less-diversified portfolio than you really think. In other words, if both funds hold Microsoft and Microsoft tanks, you get hit twice. Although you’re paying an expert to manage your money, they rarely beat the market—the mutual fund industry’s dirty secret!

<td>As retirees we have been to a couple of seminars and are interested in an Equity Index Annuity. Opinion pleas?</td>
<td>As already said, you have not given enough information for someone to tell you if an EIA is appropriate for you or not.  Keep in mind that EIA's are fixed annuities and should be considered fixed income investments and not equity investments.  Most of the time, EIA's will not give you returns anywhere near the index returns.  The reason for this is that EIA's have a Cap rate (the most they can go up in 1 year) and a participation rate (the % of that gain that you will receive).  For example, lets say that your EIA is tied to the S&amp;P 500 and the Cap rate is 10% and the participation rate is 90%.  If the S&amp;P 500 goes up 20% in a year, your return will be 9% (90% of the cap rate 10%).  If the index has a negative return, you get 0%.  Make sure if you invest in an EIA that you know these rates ahead of time.

If you like the idea of tax deferred growth (an annuity) and you are looking for stock market participation, and you want a guarantee of your principal then take a look at a variable annuity with living benefits.

Keep in mind that most annuities have lengthy surrender periods.  They also have costs that are built in so the insurance company can give you the guarantees.

Under the right circumstances, there is definitely a place for annuities in a long term investment plan.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of unscrupulous, product pushing salesman out there that call themselves Financial Advisors that are only interested in trying to make a big commission.  Annuities are not an easy subject to learn about on your own. I would recommend that you seek out an experienced, trustworthy, Financial Advisor to help you.  Start by asking family members and close friends for a referral.

<td>can somebody provide formulae for different kinds of annuities, preferebly with examples.?</td>
<td>You typically cannot do the calculations yourself without knowing what crediting rate the particular insurance company uses when calculating your payout amount. This rate will vary from company to company. Remember that annuities have two phases, accumulation and distribution. The type of annuity (fixed, variable, equity index) typically doesn't have any relation to what annuitization options are available to the owner at annuitization.

During Accumulation:

Fixed annuities credit a specified interest rate, set annually with a minimum rate specified in the contract.

Variable annuities have several subaccounts (like mutual funds) that you can allocate among. The rate of return is determined by market forces. You can be as aggressive or as conservative with your allocation as you like. Many VA's also have optional guarantees that will provide a floor to the account value used to calculate your payout at annuitization. These typically range from 5-7% equivalent annual rate of return.

Equity index annuities tie the rate you earn to an index, with a cap on performance. If the index returns over the cap, your account gets the cap rate. If the index is below the cap but still positive, you get that rate. If the index has negative returns (loses money) you get 0%, but no loss.

AT ANNUITIZATION:

All contracts will typically have several options. The most prevalent are:

Straight Life - Payout based on owner's assumed mortality age only. Payouts stop only when owner dies. If you outlive the insurance company's assumption, you win. If you don't, the insurance company wins. This option results in the highest monthly payout amount

Joint and Survivor- Payout based on owner's and spouse's (or other named party) assumed mortality age. If annuitiant dies, survivor gets some percentage of payout for the rest of their life. This percentage is usually 50, 75 or 100%, The payout amounts are much lower in this option than in Straight Life option

Installment Refund - Payments based on owners mortality, but if owner dies before sum of payments at least equals the total amount annuitized the payments continue to a specified beneficiary until they total the full amount annuitized. If the owner lives beyond expected mortality, payments continue until owners death. This option usually yields a payout slightly less than the straight life option. In my experience, this is the most popular option.</td>

<td>Considering impending lawsuit;is money invested in an Express I.R.A. Account through H.&amp;R. Block safe?</td>

The lawsuit will not endanger any money that you have invested (or are planning to invest) into an Express IRA account. However, you should evaluate whether or not this is a good investment for you.

The issue that has brought about this lawsuit (other than Attorney General Spitzer's gubernatorial campaign) seems to be the fact that many of these accounts lose money after fees. If your account is (hypothetically) earning 3% per year, that may not offset the account fees, depending on how much is invested. A net loss on the account after fees is still likely to provide you with a tax benefit, but you should look for an alternative IRA investment, which will provide real investment gains in addition to the tax benefit.</td>

<td>How Google profited by Dutch Auction?</td>
<td>When a company decides to go public they hire an underwriter.  The underwriter tears apart the books and the business model of the company and figures out a valuation for the business.  Between the company and the underwriter, they then figure out how much money to raise.  That will determine how many shares are offered and at what price.  These days (most of the time) when a company does an IPO, the main underwriting company guarantees that the IPO will be succesful.  They do this by agreeing to purchase all of the shares of the IPO.  They then turn around and offer the shares to the public.  Because of the risk to the underwriter, financially as well as reputation, the underwriter usually prices the IPO a little low to ensure success of floating the shares.  They also want to show immediate gains for their institutional and bigger clients that purchase the shares.  This will build their reputation and will help them with future deals.  

When a company decides to do a Dutch Auction, the underwriter loses control of the deal and doesn't like the increased risk.  The benefit to the company is that they receive the true market value for their shares.  In the Google situation that was great because the company got a lot more money, but it can also go the other way.</td>

<td>How do I go about buying stock in a company in Canada? I have never done this before and have little $.?</td>
<td>I've never been to Canada but if the system is anything like it is here in the U.S., (and I assume it is) buying stock requires going through a stock broker.  The big exception to this is when someone purchases some stock from one company (usually a big, well-known company) through a broker initially because they not only like the company, but because that company has an arrangement set up where shareholders can buy additional shares of their company from the company directly with no added commission.  This is generally offered to shareholders each time the company pays dividends.  Many companies do this but most don't.  These arrangements are called dividend reinvestment plans (DRIP's) and often allow shareholders to buy a certain number of shares more than just what they've been paid in dividends each time (generally quarterly).

Since you only have a little bit of money, this might not be a bad idea to start off.  But these days, discounted fees are not that high. In fact they're pretty low.  So the fees really aren't that much of a concern, unless you're going to buy something like one share of a stock at $5.00 and it costs you $10.00 to buy it, the stock would have to go up five times before you could sell it at a profit ($10 to buy, $10 to sell, $5 original cost = $25.  Therefore, the stock would have to get to $26 before you profited by $1... not likely, at lease in our lifetime).  It's much easier to make money the more stock you buy at one time.  For instance if you bought 1000 shares at $5 each, the total would be $5000 plus commission.  If in this case the commission was $15, you would make $95 just by the stock going to 5 1/8 in price.  Big difference.

There are many different levels of brokers, from the expensive kind that hold your hand and help you pick the investments that they feel are best for you (or maybe where they get the most commission on the transaction) or discount brokers where you do your own research and make your own choices.  Some discounters help you a bit with research and advice, but you do the lion's share of the work.

Most brokers don't like to deal with transactions that are in other than "round lots" which are shares in amounts that are in increments of 100 shares (100, 200, 500, 1000, etc), so you may have to shop around a bit to find one interested in helping you if you want to purchase stock in "odd lots" (1, 33, 121, etc).

By the way, I haven't traded in stocks in quite a few years, so things could have changed since then.  Whatever I say should be checked out with someone (like a trusted broker) who is maybe a bit more current than I.

<td>i need to invest 5000 in stock. anybody recommend any good stock for long term?</td>
<td>The answer to this question is not an easy one because it depends so much on 2 things:  risk tolerance and diversification.

Based on your question, I am assuming that you are a young individual who considers $5,000 to be a significant amount of money.  In addition, I have made the assumption that you are new to the markets and do not have much if any other holdings.  Since you are looking for a long-term investment I am assuming that you have a moderate level of risk tolerance.

So, if you are new to the markets and young and $5,000 is a very significant amount of money to you then I would invest in an index fund...for example, the S&amp;P 500.  The reason for this is because most people (including Jim Cramer.  lol) cannot outperform the market by picking individual stocks.  Furthermore an index fund gives you diversification into many different companies.  Statistics have shown that in order to have a properly diversified stock portfolio you must own approximately 30 stocks.  With $5,000 you simply cannot own that amount.  Since you are looking for a long-term recommendation, an index fund really fits the bill.

With that said, if you insistent upon a stock selection for the long-run and do not care about diversification then you should choose a well established company such as Microsoft.  However, it is important to remember that every company (GM, Ford, MSFT, AT&amp;T,etc) that was once considered stable faces competition and changes today that are very different from years past and the future is very uncertain. 

Think about it like this, if somebody really knew which stock or stocks were going to outperform the market over the long term, I think that person would be on the beach somewhere trading away!  So, when you ask people on Yahoo Answers for a stock recommendation maybe you should ask them why they are here giving you that recommendation rather than enjoying the fruits of their stock picking ability!

I am not saying it is impossible to pick winners...people do and some people (Warren Buffet) are actually very good at it.  But the sad truth is most are not and most money managers under-perform the market anyway.

So if you want to gamble your money in stocks then go ahead and pick some biotech names, etc.  But my recommendation first would be to build a solid core portfolio base through an index fund before venturing off into one-off names.  Once you have an established base, then you can look for individual names to help you generate alpha (excess return) and trade those over a short-medium term.

When you are ready for the short-medium term trades you should consider the markets at that point.  For now I would focus on certain types of energy stocks (esp. some high tech energy stocks) and most certainly in the healthcare/biotech field.  

Good luck!</td>

<td>all types exlcuding financial servies, and how many US firms received qualified audit reports?</td>
<td>Good luck finding an answer to that question.  It is not required for any audit to notify any agency whether or not a qualified or unqualified or disclaimed opinion was issued.  Nor is there any agency that collects this information.  There are so many companies, government, SEC and non-SEC, that have to have an audit every year - that would be way too much information to accumulate.

The only way for you to get that information would be to read every audit opinion for every company that had an audit.  And much of this information is not available since a large number of audits are for small businesses since they have to have audits for banking agreements/loans.</td>

<td>how can i become a millionaire?My capital is 50000 us$.?</td>
<td>There is not enough information to answer your question.

I suggest you to ask:
how can i become a millionaire?My capital is 50000 us$. and my age is 18 and I want to become a millionaire at 55?

If you start to invest young it is very easy to become a millionaire.

There are three ways you can become a millionaire.
1) You work for somebody else.
2) You start your own company.
3) You invest your $50,000.00 (Savings Account, Bonds, Mutual Funds, Stock Markets, Gold and so on)

1) You get a college degree at Harvard at start right out of graduation with a $100,000.00 Salary. (If you get accepted at Harvard, they will loan you the money if you are poor, other schools have similar loan programs)
This is your initial salary, most students get $200,000.00 or $300,000 after a few years.
Asuming you don't get fired and you save half your income you become a millionaire in under a decade.
If you don't get accepted at Harvard (Or any other high profile school) and instead you go to a "common" school or to a community college you will get a $40,000 salary at the very least.
The same principle applies and you become a millionaire in under a quarter of a century.

2) You start your own business and you become a millionaire in 8 years or less if your business success. However, there is a very high possibility that your business fails and you end up with $0 of the $50,000 you invested.
Another more safe approach would be to invest just $25,000 in your FIRST BUSINESS and in case it fails you still have another $25,000 to TRY AGAIN.
This will make you a millionaire in a over a decade instead of 8 years but you will have 2 chances to fail.

3) Asuming the profits are reinvested you only need a return on your investment of 11% a year to become a millionaire in 29 Years.

If you want to become a millionaire faster, the answer is more complicated. Drop me a line if you want more detailed information.</td>

Another stock I really like is TRFX--they are a stable company and bounce around 5 and 5.50, so see if you can get them at five and then hope they end your 5 weeks near 5.50
One word of advise--buy things that aren't 10,000 dollars a share and all that because with only 30k you can't get very many shares of big companies. Try to stick with stuff under 40 bucks a share.
Now if you wanna' be really safe and not make or lose money, then listen to the other peeps suggestions like hotels, nike, etc. 
If you wanna win on the other hand, try goin with stuff that is unexpected. Every dork in your class is gonna take Wal*Mart, adidas, etc.  So try something new and origional!</td>

Sometimes by the time you have to go to the bank to get it out or even if you call to transfer it to your checking account, you have time to not make an impulse buy and sometimes that saves you from spending it. As for the doing business with it, what do you exactly mean? invest in the market? Hate to tell you but the returns are not so good right now and haven't been for many long years. You are more likely to lose it in the market. As for investing it in a business, that is risky too. Any business can go belly up at any time.

The money from private placements will come from accredited investors defined by the SEC Rule 501 under Regulation D as:


an individual earning 200k per year.

<td>What is considered a "good" return on an investment such as a mutual fund?</td>
<td>There are all different types of mutual funds, so a "good return" depends on what the fund is invested in.  Every fund is classified by the sector that it is in and then the returns are judged against a benchmark.  So for example, if a growth fund consistently beats the return of the S&amp;P 500 with a 13% average annual return than it would be considered a good return.  Conversely, if a government bond fund had an average annual return of 7% per year that would also be considered a good return.

To do some research on "good returns", you can use tools like Yahoo Finance or go straight to the third party, mutual fund reporting companies like Morningstar and Lipper.

<td>Do you think most multilevel marketing opportunities are legitimate business opportunities or scams?</td>
<td>Before you 'invest' check out http://www.mlmwatch.org/ - they have a list of resources regarding MLM schemes, what to watch out for, consumer complaints, and recent government action against MLM companies.

Also check out the Federal Trade Commission warning/alert on MLMs http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/invest/mlm.htm

Here are the main points from the FTC:

The Federal Trade Commission cannot tell you whether a particular multilevel marketing plan is legal. Nor can it give you advice about whether to join such a plan. You must make that decision yourself. However, the FTC suggests that you use common sense, and consider these seven tips when you make your decision: 

Avoid any plan that includes commissions for recruiting additional distributors. It may be an illegal pyramid. 

Beware of plans that ask new distributors to purchase expensive inventory. These plans can collapse quickly -- and also may be thinly-disguised pyramids. 

Be cautious of plans that claim you will make money through continued growth of your "downline" -- the commissions on sales made by new distributors you recruit -- rather than through sales of products you make yourself. 

Beware of plans that claim to sell miracle products or promise enormous earnings. Just because a promoter of a plan makes a claim doesn't mean it's true! Ask the promoter of the plan to substantiate claims with hard evidence. 

Beware of shills -- "decoy" references paid by a plan's promoter to describe their fictional success in earning money through the plan. 

Don't pay or sign any contracts in an "opportunity meeting" or any other high-pressure situation. Insist on taking your time to think over a decision to join. Talk it over with your spouse, a knowledgeable friend, an accountant or lawyer. 

Do your homework! Check with your local Better Business Bureau and state Attorney General about any plan you're considering -- especially when the claims about the product or your potential earnings seem too good to be true.</td>

It is in essence, no different than a farmers market in the sense that there are buyers and sellers of "things".  The stock market is a highly organized medium for making these trades happen.  Underneath the surface, the stock market is a place where people, IE: investors, express their opinions about many different issues such as politics, the economy, globalization, wars, corruption, and just about everything you can imagine.  Those views are reflected in the price that market instruments trade for. I really could keep writing here infinitely, but I'll wrap it up by saying that, once again, the stock market is a place where trades allow investors to express their opinion about the equities that underlie those trades.

Yes it is 1.4B

TEST#3 : Is volume greater than 200,000

I'm fairly certain that political conflict will spread beyond what it is now. The growth of new states (and the dissolution of old ones) seems to be increasing over the past few decades. War over new borders is inevitable, just look at the Balkans. Whenever there's political volatility, it seems to follow that there is economic stagnation through politically-motivated tariffs, so yes, I would agree that there is likely to be major economic problems in the middle-near future.

For the past half century, we were in the midst of a sort of mini-golden age. All such ages eventually come to an end, and remember that right before the collapse every golden age in history almost nobody saw it coming. Of course, that so many seem to be of your opinion might serve to actually scare the economy straight and make us "doomsayers" look like cranks, but I kind of doubt that anything could motivate so fractious a society as we currently find ourselves in.</td>

The quality of data on the web and even the quality available to brokerages is TERRIBLE. The primary problem is NOT the daily pricing, but rather the handling of dividends, splits, mergers, and other corporate actions that impact total return (what you actually make on a share).

I personally make a living taking the standard data provided by the exchanges and then fixing and cleaning it for use by people like yourself.

Nevertheless, my services also come with a standard disclaimer which I deeply regret having to use because of potential liability.

<td>Option trading in Scottrade - difference between "buy to open, buy to close, sell to close, and sell to open"</td>
<td>I'm not sure what you are asking for, but I'll tell you the meaning of the options.
Let's use as an option example Yahoo Strike 30 March and say trading at $.65 an option and you are going to buy/sell one contract

Buy to open- Buy to open is to buy this option and for 1 contract you would pay $65 and $8 transaction fee. 

Sell To Close- You can not do this first, you need to own and option first. So, if you bought the yahoo option and it is now worth $.9 You would sell it and make $90 $-8 transaction fee.

Now what I think you are interested in is the opposite

Sell to open- means that you sell this option and you will recieve $65 in your account - transaction fee and you could do whatever you want with your money.

Buy to close is simply to buy back your option. If you think the option will expire worthless and do not want to buyback, then you may not need to do this action. 

Hope I was some help.

ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. If you have sold more than one option contract and it is likely to be exercised, buy back the option. Because buy back is only $7 +1.25(per contract) per transaction, but getting exercised is $8 per contract.</td>

<td>I just want to clarify that there are MANY licenses/requirements, even if you have less than $25 Million in assets.  The $25 Million threshold only applies to registration under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Regardless of assets, you wuld still have to structure your company to be exempt from the Investment Company Act of 1940, and you would have to apply for a Regulation D exemption from the Securities Act of 1933.  If you want to raise more than $1Million under Reg D, you will also need an audit.  Additionally, you must register at with the state securities commission in every state where you offer securities (shares of your fund).  If you have less than $25 Million and therefore are exempt from federal Investment Adviser registration, you probably have to register as an Investment Adviser in each state where you sell shares of your fund.

Definition

An account in which the named holder holds the assets in it on behalf of another (the beneficiary).

The shares are registered in the name of the broker, but the client has beneficial ownership of them. The advantage of nominee accounts is that they make settlement quicker and more streamlined. In theory, dealing costs should be lower. There are some disadvantages: because the individual isn't the registered owner of the shares, he doesn't get sent company reports and accounts, and can't take advantage of shareholder perks, unless his brokers provides a special forwarding service.</td>

<td>How do you research a stock?</td>
<td>Depends which investing strategy:
Day trading (buying and selling short run): You don't need to research much more than the what sector the company is.  More importantly you need to research economic trends (such as impact on high oil prices, shortages of textiles, etc.) and how they impact that stocks sector. Buy low, sell high when the economic trends change.

For true investment (long term): Look at how long a company has been in business.  Look at earning growth by quarter, check stock price history to see if it is on an up turn or down turn.  Also check out the competition (best is when there is a merger and you get stock from the competitor during the buy out).  Remember stock portfolios are really meant for 20 yrs to be of real value, make sure the company has progressed better than the stockmarket average.  Or just buy mutual funds which take advantage of many stocks' trends.</td>

<td>Safely earn 10%. How?</td>
<td>If your idea of being safe equals taking no risk at all, you are asking the impossible. The "zero risk" return rate is sometimes defined as the one of government bonds from US or large EU countries, presently in the range of 2% to 3%. If somebody tells you that there is a zero risk investment with performance better than this, you can safely discard such an advice.
But if you are ready to assume some reasonable risk, and have a mid-term time horizon (say, 5 years) you can go a little closer to your target by building a diversified portfolio of indexed funds or ETFs. Of course you can do it in many ways, the optimal balance between risk and performance is a very personal issue. A classic balance, perhaps a bit old-fashioned but still valid, is 50% stocks and 50% bonds, each portion properly diversified.</td>

If you are new to trading, then you should definitely take a look at trading systems.

Here's why:

Every minute more than 150 Million Dollars change hands in the electronic index futures markets like the e-mini S&amp;P and e-mini NQ. You can win or lose thousands of dollars in a few minutes; the futures markets can make you rich in a few weeks or months or wipe out your account with no mercy.

If you want to compete in the “game of games” and play against the best traders in the world, then you need to get ready. Too many gamblers are entering the arena without any plan or strategy, completely unprepared, and that's why they lose.

Trading a system will dramatically increase your chances to succeed in trading, because it eliminates five of the top six reasons why unprepared traders fail.

Here are the top six reasons why traders fail,
and how a trading system eliminates them

Let's take a look at the reasons why traders lose money:

    1. Lack of a Trading Plan
    2. Lack of Discipline to Follow the Plan
    3. Failure to Control Emotions
    4. Failure to Accept and Limit Losses
    5. Lack of Commitment
    6. Over-Trading

By all means you have to avoid these mistakes if you want to win.

Here's how a trading system eliminates 5 of the 6 top reasons why traders fail:

Solution #1: Having a trading plan

Having a trading system means having a pre-defined set of rules you have developed to guide your trading. Therefore you HAVE a trading plan, eliminating the No.1 cause for failure.

Solution #2: Following the trading plan

The easiest way to follow a trading plan is to automate it. Almost every trading system can be automated, and you could let the computer trade for you. You won't have to worry about your discipline any longer, as the computer mechanically trades every setup for you.

Solution #3: Controlling emotions

Trading with a system removes emotions from trading. If you don't have a strategy and you try to make decisions when the market is moving, you are liable to become emotionally attached to positions. You may experience panic and indecision when the market does not move in your favor, as you do not have a prepared response. That's when most traders lose their money. If you follow a system you will know what to do no matter what the market does.

Solution #4: Controlling your losses

You probably have heard the saying “Let your profits run”. Unfortunately most traders let their losses run. A trading system will get you out of a position when the predefined stop is hit. Unless you override the system to “give the trade a little bit more room” it will stop the loss and therefore limit your losses.

Solution #5: Commitment

You won't believe how many traders show a lack of commitment and therefore lose money. Lack of commitment means that they stop trading after the first loss, and don't give their system a chance to make back the money they lost. Trading is not a one-way street, and losses are part of our business. If you can't accept the fact that there will be losses, you shouldn't trade. Fortunately a trading system can help you to overcome this problem; an automated trading system continues trading according to the rules, and therefore adds much more consistency to your trading.

As you can see, five of the six top reasons why traders lose money in the markets are simply eliminated when you start trading with a system.

Without any guarantee, your chances of making money rise incredibly when starting with a profitable trading system.

Hope that helps.</td>

<td>what is industry exposure ratio?</td>
<td>In order to estimate COVARIANCE MATRICES, most analysts contruct stock prices as a linear combination of factors.
Obe way to do that is factor Analysis, in which you find orthogonal factors that explain the stock prices.
Then, you can calculate the covariance between two stocks as the covariance between to factor portfolios. Since portfolios, by definition, are less volatile than individual factors, then the covariance estimation is more stable.
The drawback for that technique is that factors, except for the first ones, do not have an easy explanation.
Some companies, most notably BARRA have devised methods for constructing stock returns as linear combinations of non-orthogonal but easily identifiable factors.
One kind of such factors is INDUSTRY EXPOSURE:
How much of a stock return is explained by an industry index?
For further information, I recommend you reading on FACTOR ANALYSIS AND PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS for the statistical part,
For the financial theory that support the use of these techniques, read on ARBITRAGE PRICING THEORY, which is about explaining return as a function of a set of factors</td>

<td>How do people who own shares make money from them by just owning shares?</td>
<td>There are several ways to make money by buying shares. Any shares bought are obviously owned by you. You can keep the shares if they are good and profitable company, and wait for dividents usually paid quarterly, haLf yearly or sometimes annually, meaning once a year. But usually, if you want to make better money, buy the shares at a lower price, during a poor market, wait for the price of that share to go up. Draw a margin how much you want to make and sell at that price when it reaches that amount of your choice. Sometimes, your broker may advise you to hold on because he may know the price is going up further and you may be able to make more.When market is good, it is more advisable to sell on profit rather than wait for the dividends which are usually very much lower than the market gains. Having advised all that, please do not be too greddy or obssessed by the share market, otherwise you may burn your fingers and lose all that you have earned or more.</td>

<td>Can somebody explain to me and provide an example regarding zero cost collar?</td>
<td>Zero Cost Color:
This is a good strategy for a bullish investor who believes that the underlying stock will continue to rise in value. These collars involve the purchase of a put and sale of a call, with the strike price of the call set to generate exactly enough cash to pay for the put. The strategy allows the investor to costless hedge while still maintaining potential for profit in the position. 

Benefits: 
The important benefits of a zero cost collar (ZCC) are 

# It provides for taking position with no initial outlay. 

# It helps investors holding stock to protect against adverse price movement while capping the upward movement 

# It helps investor to receive all corporate benefits like dividends etc. from their position in the stock but with the relevant protection. 

Suitability: 
ZCC will suit the following types of investors 

# Shareholders, whose holdings have appreciated in value significantly, but wish to protect their holdings around the current price levels. 

# Investors who hold most of their assets in securities but would like to release some cash from their holdings without actually selling them and also protect against downside movement can go for collars for credits. 

# Employees with vested stock options who want to protect the downside or when they want to fund part of their acquisition. 

When a ZCC is used as a method of share protection, the investor can set the floor level and the cap can be calculated leading to a zero outlay. The higher the floor, the lower will be the cap required to achieve zero outlay. Conversely, if a lower floor is set, a relatively higher cap can be achieved.</td>

The 6.5 bp under swaps would indicate the pricing of the bond (or other instrument) relative to the swap market.  In other words the  "bond" would be priced to yield 6.5 basis points (.065% or .00065) under swaps that have a maturity in 2008.</td>

<td>what is a ponzi schame?</td>
<td>Here is the whole story.

Carlo (or Charles) Ponzi was an Italian immigrant who bilked millions of dollars out of thousands of hopeful investors in the 1920s, in what has since become known as a Ponzi Scheme. Ponzi arrived in the U.S. in 1903, then made his way to Canada by 1908. After a jail term for forgery, Ponzi was arrested for smuggling aliens into the U.S. and ended up in a federal prison in Atlanta, Georgia. He settled in Boston and worked as a dishwasher for years before coming up with a plan to get rich. In 1919 he formed the Securities Exchange Company (SEC), promising financial success by converting foreign postage coupons into U.S. currency. Ponzi promised returns too good to be true. And they were: early investors were paid off with money from new investors; there was no real investment going on, just cash distribution. (The approach is also known as a "pyramid scheme.") Beginning in late 1919 and early 1920, Ponzi moved as much as $15 million from thousands of investors, eventually using 35 branch offices. The scheme fell apart eight months later and Ponzi was convicted of embezzlement. His legal troubles dragged on for more than a decade and he was in and out of jail in the U.S. until 1934, when he was deported to Italy. He worked briefly for Benito Mussolini and then landed a job running an airline in Brazil, where he died destitute in 1949.</td>

<td>why should I buy home in california?</td>
<td>I wouldn't suggest it unless you are buying a home that you intend to live in for a long time, not for an investment. California is beautiful, but it's so overinflated. I believe that people will continue to buy in California, even if the "bubble" burts because it's such a great place to live, but I don't think the houses are going to increase at the pace they have in the past few years. It will have to correct itself.

If you are just looking for an investment, consider Phoenix, Tucson or Las Vegas. They are the ones that are increasing so fast now. 

I would recommend that anyone check out Rancho Sahuarita. It's south of Tucson, a planned community that is like a resort area. Houses are very well priced, especially compared to California, and they expect the area to quadruple in size over the next 15 years. The community is really, really nice, all new homes in several different price ranges. It's extremely family oriented, only 19 minutes from Tucson but not at all like Tucson (this is a small community of about 17,000 people right now). It has it's own water park, lake, rec center and community activities that are private...just for people who live in Rancho Sahuarita. There is a commercial center (small) built like a town sqauare and condusive to walking. Their are hiking trails and wide sidewalks an one or two active adult designated areas. It's close to shopping, a 6 screen theater, bowling, plus the culture of Tucson, the University of Arizona, Madera Canyon and more. 

Although I don't live there (I live in nearby Green Valley, an active adult community), I'm thinking of going in with my daughter to purchase a home as an investment for me and to privide a chance for her to live in her own home. She lives in California and can't buy a house there. She's a single mom and could never afford to buy in California. She's planning to move in July.

I went to Forman Mills' website and there is no "investor information" section. It says they have only 17 stores, so based on this, they are a relatively small company and I am guessing that they are not publicly traded. If that is the case, they are not required to make public any of their financial information and will probably not disclose it to you even if you called and asked. 

However, it is a possibility that the company is owned by a larger publicly traded company. However, Forman Mills' website does not indicate this. If they are owned by a publicly traded company, you would be able to find the 10-K for that company, but it would likely provide consolidated information and would not give you information about Forman Mills on a stand-alone basis.</td>

<td>what is CFDs?</td>
<td>contract for difference, also commonly known as a CFD, is an equity derivative that allows users to speculate on share price movements, without the need for ownership of the underlying shares. CFDs are traded over-the-counter (OTC).

Contracts for differences allow investors to take long or short positions and unlike futures contracts they have no fixed expiry date or contract size. Trades are conducted on a margined basis with margins typically starting at ten percent for CFDs on leading equities.

The contracts are subject to a daily financing charge, usually applied at a previously agreed rate above or below LIBOR or other interest rate benchmark. Users pay to finance long positions and receive funding on short positions in lieu of deferring sale proceeds. The contracts are settled for the cash differential between the price of the opening and closing trades.

The product was originally devised by the derivative desk of Smith New Court - an independent but hugely successful London based trading house - in the early 1990s. The advantage of CFDs was that they allowed the firm's large hedge-fund clients to be able to easily short the market whilst being able to benefit from effective leverage as well as the same stamp duty exemptions enjoyed by members of the London Stock Exchange.

Towards the end of the 1990s as the dotcom boom started to take hold, the product was adopted for the private client market by GNI touch, the newly developed online trading arm of London based GNI (Gerrard &amp; National Intercommodities). GNI offered the CFD product alongside an innovative trading system which in addition provided clients with the ability to trade via the internet directly into the London Stock Exchange order-driven trading systems.

For the first time, individuals trading their own accounts, as well as small institutions and investment funds who did not have the resources available to allow them direct connectivity to the London Stock Exchange, could trade the UK equity market on a level footing with the largest institutions.

They have now become widespread with some commentators suggesting that up to 25 percent of UK stock market turnover is attributable to CFDs. Similar products were introduced in Australasia in 2002, and have now spread to Canada and some Far East markets.</td>

If you daytrade in the United States of America by Law you will get a Credit Line of at least $100,000.00 (This is called a margin account) 

However, if you don't have assets of at least $75,000.00 (For example, a $25,000 car and a $50,000 property) that you can sell in case things go wrong I strongly suggest you NOT TO DAYTRADE ON MARGIN WITHOUT LIMITING YOUR LOSSES TO A MAXIMUM OF 25% (This means you will only lose your original $25,000)

If you want I can email the Daytrading Laws.

Do not listen to cgimwei. 
You need at least $500 to open a brokerage account in Scottrade.com

Example 1:
You cannot invest all your money in just one company. Therefore we are going to invest $225 in each company.
You buy 10 shares for $225 in Wal-Mart 
You buy 10 shares for $225 in Target

Let's say you got lucky and both stocks actually went up 5% that day.

Your stocks are now worth $236.25 ($11.25 Profit)

However, you already paid $7 when you bought them and you need to pay another $7 when you sell them

Therefore in this example you actualy lose money.

You also need to consider you have to pay taxes on your capital gains. (Consult your Accountant before you start daytrading)

<td>Investors  is YHOO currently undervalued?  it seems like a good time to buy to me?</td>
<td>Initially I also thought about this question whether yhoo is really undervalued or not. What surprized me the most is that it offers a lot of services that are still not noticed and not given the "publicity" they deserve.

But when it comes to looking at the stock prize, its not how good yhoo is at present, its all about how good yhoo will be in future. In growth stocks people dont care if the stock is right now on a high or low but only care about its future prospects.
Yahoo's history reveals very well that whatever yahoo has in competition with its rivals is not its own products. It has reached this status with fast and numerous acquisitions. This implies that its own technology is not one of its strengths and so undermines investors' confidence in its future prospects of being able to come up with anything new on its own.
Besides this, even though it has made so many acquisitions and is a very stable company, it does not have any revenue generating stream other than online advertising which is clearly dominated by its rivals.

My point is that yahoo is neither known for its "techonology" nor for being the main player in its revenue generating business.
Unless, it creates something on its own or opens another revenue generating stream, its hard to see its price going up.

When you say it is good for "long" investment, its hard to comment because the definition of "long term" is relative.

If you want to look for undervalued stocks, I'd suggest look at value stocks and not growth stocks. The whole concept of buying an undervalued stock and holding it till people recognize it applies to value stocks.

<td>What are Class A, B, and C mutual funds ?</td>
<td>Share class
Class A shares typically impose a front-end sales load. They also tend to have a lower 12b-1 fee and lower annual expenses than other mutual fund share classes. Be aware that some mutual funds reduce the front-end load as the size of your investment increases. If you're considering Class A shares, be sure to inquire about breakpoints.[5] 

Class B shares typically do not have a front-end sales load. Instead, they may impose a contingent deferred sales load and a 12b-1 fee (along with other annual expenses). Class B shares also might convert automatically to a class with a lower 12b-1 fee if the investor holds the shares long enough.[6] 

Class C shares might have a 12b-1 fee, other annual expenses, and either a front- or back-end sales load. But the front- or back-end load for Class C shares tends to be lower than for Class A or Class B shares, respectively. Unlike Class B shares, Class C shares generally do not convert to another class. Class C shares tend to have higher annual expenses than either Class A or Class B shares.[7]</td>

companies typically sell shares of stock to raise money.

so when you buy stock, you are buying a fractional ownership in that company.

at times the company will return some of its earnings back to shareholders in the form of dividends.  the yield would be the amount of the dividend divided by the cost of the share.  Much like the interest you receive on your savings account at the bank, the dividend yield represents your return on your investment.</td>

If So, You can use Newell Recycling in Atlanta,
They don't list there prices that they pay out for copper, but its a big company with several locations in Atlanta, and  other smaller recycling companies use them. The SE office is located not far from Alanta Airport in Eastpoint (I-85 Exit Number 75).
The Website: http://www.newellrecycling.com/industrial/
Phone: 404.669.5015

If you want to sell it local, (in Columbus GA)
Then the best place to check is your local recycling center there in Columbus, GA. I couldn't find any websites for the few recycling centers there in your city.

Hope that helps.

You will have to ask general questions, like what type of equipment they use, where they get it from. Then you can do the last step easily by calling the companies that sell the stuff.

Maybe I am wrong and someone will just spit out the answer. If so I will be impressed.

The best strategy for a beginner is to systematically, dollar cost average into a low cost mutual fund.  Find yourself a good no load, index or growth fund and set up an account to automatically take a fixed amount from your bank account every month.  When the market is low, you are buying more shares and when the market is high, you are buying less shares.  You will find that you won't miss the money and in a short period of time you will discover the power of dollar cost averaging combined with the compounding of money.  Good luck!!</td>

    * In linguistics and etymology, a derivative is a word that is formed from a more basic word.
    * Derivative in chemistry, see derivative (chemistry)
    * In finance, a derivative contract is one whose value is derived from that of one or more underlying securities, commodities or other quantities such as the weather.
    * A derivative work is a modification of an original work, such as a book, a play, a movie a musical composition, etc. For example, movie based on a novel is a derivative work.



In finance, a derivative is a financial contract from which payoffs over time are derived from the performance of assets (such as commodities, shares or bonds), interest rates, exchange rates, or indices (such as a stock market index, consumer price index (CPI) or an index of weather conditions). This performance can determine both the amount and the timing of the payoffs, and these payoffs can be in cash, as well as be the delivery of the underlying asset. This flexibility in underlying and payoff leads to a huge range of different derivatives contracts that are traded in the market. The main types of derivatives are futures, forwards, options and swaps.</td>

<td>I WANT TO KNOW WHERE I CAN GO TO FINd OUT INFORMATON ABOUT BUSINESS AQUISITIONS, AND HOW I CAN GET GRANTs?</td>
<td>It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.

Nonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.

Even if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.

Even SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... 

"The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."

Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program 

Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs 

For private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for "students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices." Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.</td>

I'm not sure what you mean by "probability method." And how do you "price" a stock market? Do you mean "is it "overpriced"?" Yes, it is overpriced by Dividend Ratios, momentum, historical price, and every and any other measure you can use. But it can also stay overpriced for months or even years at a time.

You don't say what you are trying to do. Are you looking for indicators to time the market, e.g., when it might be a good time to get out, or in?

Download the historical quotes on the DJIA all the way back to the 1929 Crash and load them into Excel or some other spreadsheet. Look at the Trend. The Trend is your friend. When the Trend is broken, that's the time to act. 

Sounds like you've really got a ways to go friend. Are you sure you want to do this yourself? There are hundreds of books on the subject available throught the library for free, but I will recommend two.

One is called "Which Is Better, Buy-and-Hold or Market Timing?" The other is "Do You Have What It Takes to Be a Market Timer?" They will give you plenty to think about.</td>

I suspect you are holding actual shares - bad idea.  If you loose them they are as negotiable as cash and there are NO guarantees against loss or theft.  

When you want to sell your shares you will have to notarize your signature on the stock certificate and send them via registered mail to the company's agent for redemption - a long process that gives you no assurance of your sell price.</td>

<td>what are equity vertical swap and equity horizontal swap?</td>
<td>Equity in economics is related to the idea of fairness, particularly in terms of taxation and welfare economics. It has been studied in experimental economics as inequity aversion.

Horizontal equity is the idea that people with a similar ability to pay taxes should pay the same or similar amounts. It is related to the concept of tax neutrality or the idea that the tax system should not discriminate between similar things or people, or unduly distort behavior.

Vertical equity is the idea that people with a greater ability to pay taxes should pay more. If they pay more strictly in proportion to their income, this is known as a proportional tax or flat tax; if they pay disproportionately more then this is a progressive tax, more associated with redistribution.</td>

<td>How do I determine my cost of capeital as an investor.?</td>

  A lot of equity traders use the idea of "cost of capital" as if they were borrowing money to invest in operations-like using margin in a brokerage account.
  
Think about the term.  "Cost of capital" means how much are you paying to use this money.  So, if you borrow at 10%, and are gaining 11%...your cost of capital would be 10%.
And if you are gaining 2%, your cost of capital is..........still 10%.

<td>Invest in Mutual Fund, the way to make a fortune in mutual funds are through compounding.  Compounding happens when your earnings themselves generate more earnings, allowing you put ever-greater sums to work.  The more time that goes by, the more powerful compounding becomes.

In order to get the most benefit from compounding, you'll need a carefully selected growth-stock fund, and you'll need to stick with over time.  For example, if you purchased $10,000 of a diversified domestick growth-stock fund that average about 15% a year over a period of 35 years, you will have $1.28 million!

Suppose you also added $2,000 each year and let it compound as well. your total would then come to more than $3 million!  Now, how much more do you think you'sd have if you also bought a little extra during every bear market while the fund was temporarily down 30% or more from its peak?

<td>Are performance of stock derivatives affected if stocks do not perform as expected?</td>
<td>I would use derivatives as an insurance policy to have a good night sleep, because derivatives can limit your potential loss, although it does not come without a price (like insurance premium). For example, you invest in Google shares, but you're afraid that the stock price might suddenly go down. To hedge this risk, you buy a put option, which will give you the right to sell the stock at a predetermined price (so called strike price). So, you will limit the loss to a fixed %. The price you have to pay for it is the price of the put option. So, even if you buy "at the money" (strike=current stock price ) or "in the money" (strike &gt; current price) put, you still can suffer a potential loss on your total investment, because you paid for the put. But you will know for sure the minimum return you will get. A combination of a put and a call, or shorting some of the derivatives will allow you to limit both upside and downside. A guaranteed no-loss investment will a have very limited upside potential. Why not to buy Government securities instead?

In your example you are asking for 45% annual return. Portfolio with such expected return will carry a lot of risk.</td>

<td>what exactly is a lemur? (not the small fuzzy primate)?</td>
<td>Any of several small arboreal, mostly nocturnal primates chiefly of the family Lemuridae of Madagascar and adjacent islands, having large eyes, a long slim muzzle, and a long tail.

Lemurs are part of a class of primates known as prosimians, and make up the infraorder Lemuriformes. This type of primate was the evolutionary predecessor of monkeys and apes (simians). The term "lemur" is derived from the Latin word lemures, which means "spirits of the night". This likely refers to many lemurs' nocturnal behavior and their large, reflective eyes. It is generically used for the members of the four lemuriform families, but it is also the genus of one of the lemuriform species. The two flying lemur species are not lemurs, nor are they even primates. 

Lemurs are found naturally only on the island of Madagascar, and some smaller surrounding islands, including the Comoros (where it is likely they were introduced by humans). While they were displaced in the rest of the world by monkeys, apes, and other primates, the lemurs were safe from competition on Madagascar and differentiated into a number of species. These range in size from the tiny 30 gram Peters' Mouse Lemur to the 10 kilogram Indri. The larger species have all become extinct since humans settled on Madagascar, and since the early 20th century the largest lemurs reach about 7 kilograms. Typically, the smaller lemurs are active at night (nocturnal), while the larger ones are active during the day (diurnal). 

The small cheirogaleoids are generally omnivores, eating a variety of fruits, flowers and leaves (and sometimes nectar) as well as insects, spiders and small vertebrates. The remainder of the lemurs, the lemuroids are primarily herbivores, although some species supplement their diet with insects. All lemurs are endangered species, due mainly to habitat destruction (deforestation) and hunting. Although conservation efforts are under way, options are limited because of the lemurs' limited range and because Madagascar is desperately poor. Currently, there are approximately 52 living lemur species.</td>

<td>If I have a Roth IRA account opened can I invest in private stock in a company?</td>
<td>In general terms, yes you can (assuming the company is not set up as an S corp.); IF (like Trade mentioned) you can find a broker willing to administer the account for you. There are two caveats to think about, however.

When you go off the beaten path investment-wise, be prepared for extra expenses, extra paperwork and dealing with potentially reduced liquidity.

You CANNOT own private equity within an IRA if you are also owner of the company issuing the stock. Self Dealing is a prohibited activity and it includes putting any asset into the plan that you benefit from, such as living in a house purchased by the IRA as an investment, or selling personal property to the IRA as well as selling your own company stock to the IRA.</td>

<td>what is 'short covering' means in the stock market??</td>
<td>First, you need to understand what selling short or being short a stock means.  When you short a stock you are trying to do the same thing as when you buy a stock long; buy low and sell high.  The difference is, for a short, you do that in reverse.  You think the stock is going down so you are (hopefully) selling high and then you will buy back at a future time when the stock is (hopefully) lower.  With a short position your risk is unlimited.  This is because, theoretically a stock could go up an unlimited amount.

A short gets out of his position ( or covers) by buying back the shares that he has previously sold.  When the press talks about short covering, they are usually referring to mass short covering.  This usually occurs when there is good news in a stock or the market, and the shorts are losing money or they fear they are going to lose money.  If the stock has good news and there is a lot of buying already, the additional short covering can really give the stock a big short term push.</td>

Make a report of possible fraud to the appropriate legal authorites, to the better business bureau, and to any other agency you can think of that might have an interest.

If the middleman is a large and/or recognizable organization, I would protest up the line.  I would also consider talking to local news organizations, etc.

<td>What are stock futures?</td>
<td>Futures are a financial contract obligating the buyer to purchase an asset (or the seller to sell an asset), such as a physical commodity or a financial instrument, at a predetermined future date and price. Futures contracts detail the quality and quantity of the underlying asset they are standardized to facilitate trading on a futures exchange. Some futures contracts may call for physical delivery of the asset, while others are settled in cash. The futures markets are characterized by the ability to use very high leverage relative to stock markets. 

Futures can be used either to hedge or to speculate on the price movement of the underlying asset. For example, a producer of corn could use futures to lock in a certain price and reduce risk (hedge). On the other hand, anybody could speculate on the price movement of corn by going long or short using futures.</td>

<td>How to pick undervalued stocks at stock exchanges?</td>
<td>The classical fundamental analysis approach is to compare the various ratios of similar stocks and declare the one with the "worst" ratios undervalued.  So if stock A has a price/earnings ratio of 10 and stock B has a price/earnings ratio of 15 and their prospects are equally good, then a fundamental analyst might declare stock A "undervalued".  If the stock price then goes up, the analyst is a genius.  But if they both go down, they were both obviously "overvalued".  A few people can play this game successfully, but I think there's a fatal flaw to this approach that makes it very difficult for an amateur to play.  This approach assumes that the market is stupid, and an individual can outsmart it.  I would argue that the market is rarely stupid, it's just overreactive and overemotional.  The only time a stock is reliably "undervalued" is when transitory or irrelevant news induces overreactive selling.  There are periods when stocks reporting earnings a penny below expectations are routinely hammered 10 to 25 per cent.  If the company isn't totally negative on the future, there is usually a bounceback as bargain hunters come in.  My favorite "undervaluation" moment is when an analyst downgrades a stock and knocks it down 5-10 per cent.  Most analysts aren't any smarter than the market.  If the company is doing well and the stock is in a decent uptrend, it will recover in a few hours or days.

This disturbs many people, but the truth is prices are driven by emotion and psychology, not financial ratios.  An ordinary person can take advantage of this fact when emotion gets out of hand.  I think this is a more reasonable goal than trying to be the next Warren Buffett in one's spare time.</td>

Vanguard is a good place for this sort of thing with a low minimum.

Contact your local FBI office and file a complaint with them. They can direct you to the most efficient way to resolve this issue. Assuming you voluntarily gave them the money, without threat of extortion or other mischievious means, they can file a case for you based on the fraud alone. 

Your local police department will more than likely refer you to your District Attorney - who will only push this off and tell you there is nothing that can be done locally. 

Contact your FBI office immediately and either bring them your email messages, wire transfer, and other contact information so that they can pursue this matter.

<td>Can someone explain to me in detail what calls and puts are? Do you have personal examples?</td>
<td>A call is a request to purchase a security (stock for example) with the expectation that to make money, the stock will go up in value and then be sold.

A put is a request to BORROW a security with the expectation that to make money, the stock will go down and you can then return the borrowed stock and make a profit.

Here's out a put works (just an example).
You BORROW 100 shares of a stock that is selling $10 per share and sell all of them. You then pocket $1000 (100 shares x $10).

You then wait 3 days and, lucky you, the stock goes down from $10 to $5. So you take your $1000 and you buy back 100 shares. But this only cost you $500 (100 shares x $5).

You then have $500 in cash and 500 shares. You give your 500 shares that you borrowed back to the person/company that you borrowed them from and you bank the $500.

You actually MADE MONEY by the stock value going down.

<td>I think it is a bad idea to invest borrowed money, especially if it puts your primary residence on the line.  If you insist, then obviously the first thing you want to look at is the spread between what you are paying in the form of interest on that loan, and what you hope to earn from the new investment.  There has to be a level of return that you need to achieve to just break even. Then, you have to decide what premium you wish to receive for the risk of investing, yes, every investment has risk associated with it unless you chose a risk free investment, but then you'll not make an acceptable return and you'd be better off not taking the loan to invest.  Rental income property may not be a bad idea, but that depends on where you are located int eh country.  In California, we are already seeing pricing pressures on housing, so I don't know if right now would be the best time to be buying real estate.  If you rent you home, then you loose your interest deduction, so whatever you make, you'll probably dump into rent at the condo, so you'll just pay someone else's mortgage.  Be very carefull about what you do in light of that your home is the collateral for your potential mistake.  Good luck.</td>

<td>What is the difference between "buy/sell to open/close" in options?</td>
<td>Wow, their are a lot of confused people out there in regards to options.

Options are not like shares of a stock.  They do not have a fixed number of shares.  They have open interest.  Open interest tells you how many contracts are in existence.   Options are a contract between a buyer and a seller.  When you want to sell or buy an option contract, if someone is willing to take the other side of your trade than an option contract is created.  You can sell a call or buy a call and you can sell a put and buy a put.  Because of this, when you place your trade, you have to specify whether you are opening (creating a new contract) or closing (completing a contract).  

This is why you have to specify, lets say you are long 10 call contracts on XYZ and you want to sell them.  You would enter that as a sell to close and this would close out those contracts.  If you entered that trade as a sell to open, you would still be long the 10 calls of XYZ, and you would now also be short 10 calls of XYZ.  If you did not own XYZ stock, this new position would be naked calls with unlimited risk.

<td>What is the best stock to invest in write now?</td>
<td>If you have to ask that question in this public forum, I doubt that you are positioned to risk your money in any stock today. Stock market prices are driven by Public Perception and not necessarily by the value or the income of the company. Take a look at Exxon Mobil (XOM) for the last 6 months while oil and gasoline prices were going up. XOM is down 5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial is up 7.5%. Investors who put down their money without doing their homework are easily fleeced by brokers, some who hang around chat rooms hoping to get young investors into their areas of service. Remember one thing if nothing else: stock trading is a net zero business; it produces one loser for each winner, and the loser is usually the little guy who buys (through a broker) what the big guy doesn't want. Study how the market works, find newsletters that have a good history of recommending stocks, invest your money in a step after step manner, maybe 20% each month for 5 months, and be ready to sell even if at a small loss if the value of your selected stock decreases by more than 10-20%. You will have to set your own loss limits. Good luck, but don't rush.</td>

The person in charge of this company's money got in touch with friends in other large, credit-worthy companies and began arranging the loaning of their money directly to other companies and vice versa.

That's how commercial paper started.

<td>Where can I find information on Biotechnology?</td>
<td>Biotechnology is a technology based on biology, especially when used in agriculture, food science, and medicine.

Of the many different definitions available, the one formulated by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity is one of the broadest:

"Biotechnology means any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use." (Article 2. Use of Terms) 
Biotechnology can also be defined with: "Biotechnology is the manipulation of organisms to do practical things and to provide useful products."

One section of biotechnology is the directed use of organisms for the manufacture of organic products (examples include beer, milk products, and skin). Naturally present bacteria are utilized by the mining industry in bioleaching. Biotechnology is also used to recycle, treat waste, clean up sites contaminated by industrial activities (bioremediation), and produce biological weapons.

There are also applications of biotechnology that do not use living organisms. Examples are DNA microarrays used in genetics and radioactive tracers used in medicine.

Modern biotechnology is often associated with the use of genetically altered microorganisms such as E. coli or yeast for the production of substances like insulin or antibiotics. It can also refer to transgenic animals or transgenic plants, such as Bt corn. Genetically altered mammalian cells, such as Chinese Hamster Ovarian (CHO) cells, are also widely used to manufacture pharmaceuticals. Another promising new biotechnology application is the development of plant-made pharmaceuticals.

Biotechnology is also commonly associated with breakthroughs in new medical therapies and diagnostic devices.</td>

<td>Wow, if someone knows the real effect, it would start profiting from the idea. Later, it would be useless.
 Still, inter-market behavior is very productive and can give you some edge in trading. Commodities prices influence companies related to the commodity in question. Ex. oil.
Option and future markets easily affect stock market trading. It is believed that future and option players are smarter, wealthier, and better informed that securities traders so a big trade in any of those market will influence stock trading rapidly. For example, if a big player wants to raid the market (make it go lower), they sell S&amp;P futures, leading to program selling to start. If there is weakness in the market, a pretty good sell-off is guaranteed.</td>

It depends on your bank or institution the interest rates paid.

Basically, you give a bank a minimum  amount of money, and they will hold on to it for a preset amount of time, in turn they will pay you at the end of the life of the cd a preset interest rate on the deposited money.  Example, a CD that is for 1 year at 4.5% minimum deposit of $1,000.  This means you give the bank $1,000 for 1 year, and they will give you back at the end approximately $1,045 (I believe they compute interst daily, so the 45 is an estimate.)  If you need to take the money out of the cd, you will lose the interest being earned, i think some banks will also charge a penatly for early withdrawl.  Thats the simple basics of a CD.</td>

<td>Buying stock directly from a company allows you to (potentially) avoid transaction fees.  a mutual fund provides you diversification and professional management for a fee.  These are two different beasts.  If you feel strongly about a particular stock then you should buy it, otherwise, if you have a more long term investment strategy and seek diversification then a mutual fund provides more benefit.  Also, don't forget that buying from the company directly can delay your ability to sell the stock as the company is not a market maker (like a brokerage) and you'll have to obtain the certificate, transfer it to a brokerage account, then sell it.  Not usually worth the hassel for the reduction in fees to deal with companies on an individual basis.</td>

<td>Who calculates the value of intangible assets?  And how?</td>
<td>Accounting for intangibles is a quite complex issue. It depends on the accounting standards of the country. But, the general orientation is that mostly "acquired" intangibles are capitalised (i.e. accounted in the balance sheet), "home grown" intangibles, such as brands are expensed to the Income statement.

Once an intangible is capitalised it becomes an "intangible asset", and is amortised over time. The example in the previous answer is not precise. Goodwill, is only a part of the value paid over the real value of the company acquired. The rest of the premium should be accounted for the revaluation of the assets of the acquired company.

In short, accountants determine the value of the intangible assets based on a "transaction" between the buyer and the seller. Broadly speaking, "home grown" intangibles do not carry value, and thus not accounted on the balance sheet. In reality, some development costs and software can be valued, even though no transaction exists.

Goodwill, patents, and trademarks can qualify as intangible assets if they satisfy the criteria for recognition as explained above. Human capital is a good example of showing the difference between intangibles and intangible assets. Normally, firms do not show their employees on their balance sheets, although they're firms' most valuable assets. The reason they're not accounted is the lack of objective criteria for measuring their value to the firm. Yet, there are some models in academic literature, which try to associate value to the employees. Football clubs, however, can account for their human capital, who are the players. Because, they have an objective measure of the fair value, which is the transfer fee paid as stated in a  transaction. Therefore, they can account for their players on their balance sheets.</td>

If you find a fund that interests you, call the company and ask for a prospectus and application. With true no-loads you pay no sales charges, exit fees or other charges. Load funds can charge from .5 to 9 percent in sales charges plus other charges. These sales charges are deducted directly from your initial investment and subsequent deposits. The Investors Alliance feels that most investors should buy directly from the fund company and purchase no-load funds or low-load (less than 3 percent sales charge) funds. Keep in mind also that if you buy no-load funds through a broker instead of directly by mail, you still must pay a broker's commission.</td>

The only other situation that I can think of that might (and I emphasize might) warrant reducing your 401(k) contribution is looking at the inheritance tax situation of your future heirs.  If the estate is large enough, they will not only have to pay inheritance taxes on the estate, but also income tax on the 401(k) (at least that's how it was few years ago; I doubt the law has changed).  If the only liquid investment in the estate is the 401(k), the heirs might not have enough to pay all the taxes, forcing the sale of real estate, which neither you nor your heirs might want.  If this is your case, I'd recommend contacting a tax specialist.</td>

<td>Universal life (or cash value) insurance builds up cash value, but term insurance is cheaper. I say buy term and invest the difference in a good no-load mutual fund at vanguard.com or fidelity.com. The cash value you build up from these investments will probably be higher than the whole life insurance (as you will pay less for commissions). Only buy term life insurance until you retire.  Life insurance is for replacing your lost income for your family.  After you retire, you have no income to insure.  Also see other discussions in the Insurance section.</td>

<td>How do I buy gasoline commodtities to use as a hedge against rising prices (like the airlines do)?</td>
<td>It is possible for the average person to do although its very risky. You will have to open an account with a broker and get approved to trade options and futures (make sure to tell them this when you are opening the account). You usually have to meet minimum net worth and liquidity requirements for them to let you trade. Most energy futures trade on the New York Mercantile (NYMEX check out the link below).

Here's the risky part. You can't buy just a single barrel of oil or gallon of gas. A crude oil contract is for 1,000 barrels and a gasoline contract is for 42,000 gallons. In your example above that would mean that you pay 67,000 when oil is 67 and barrel and sell it for 77,000 making $10,000. They don't make you give them the whole 67,000 instead you pay an initial margin (currently $4,725 for crude oil). You are borrowing the rest of the money from a clearing house. Now here's the part you will really like. If oil goes down instead of up, you have to give them the money you lost. Say for example that oil goes from 67 to 60 you lose your initial $4,725 plus you still owe $2,275. The more it goes down, the more you have to keep paying.

My advice is to stay away from the futures contracts, they are strictly for professionals. You can trade the options on futures contracts which are still very risky but at least you can only lose what you put in.</td>

No, it was $850 back in 1980 and is worth less than that now, even without adjusting for inflation. After adjusting for inflation, it is worth less than half what it was worth in 1980.
There are many "experts" out there that claim gold will go up.  Other "experts"  claim it will go down.  The best writers I have read on the subject  admit that gold prices are horrendously difficult to predict, and recommend buying gold only for those that like to gamble.

Lastly, invest around 15% in high-risk stocks (usually penny stocks work very well, especially in the biomedical or biotechnological areas) and be sure to check these VERY frequently.

<td>Is investing in Home Depo a wise choice for a beginner?</td>
<td>Hi,
Never start with this low an amount. The fees would kill any profit you would make.

My advice is that a person should not invest less than $1000 in a stock. 

Just do the math : If you pay $8 per trade. Then you pay $8 to buy and $8 to sell. So you are spending $16 anyway. 

Let us say you invest $500 in HomeDepot and it appreciates 10% in 1 year. Then you make $50 - $16 = $34. Which is just 6.8%.

Instead if you invest $1000. Then you make $100 - $16 = $84. Which is  8.4%.

So it is obvious that higher is your investment , lower is your fees. Based on my experience, $1,000 is a decent amount to start with on a stock.

Have fun investing.

<td>Why is the stock market future Oriented?</td>
<td>The stock market and hence stocks are "future oriented" because the valuation of any asset (including stocks) is the present value of the discounted cash flows.  Let me give you a simple example.

Say that you there was a company that was going to pay you a dividend of $10 next year...what would you pay today for that dividend next year?  You discount back the $10 at some rate and that's what you would pay today.

But let's say that you just learned that the dividend to be paid next year was only going to be $5.  Now the valuation today would be different.

With stocks and the stock market there are many different valuation techniques...but almost all are forward looking.  As things change for companies, the outlooks change and thus the present value of these companies also changes.

<td>What is the right kind of business form for real estate investing to protect my personal assets?</td>
<td>Before the Limited Liability Company (LLC), the business entity of choice for real estate was the limited partnership. You get pass through taxation, including pass-through "losses" from depreciation even when your investment was cash flow positive.

    Today, LLCs are the almost always used for real estate investment. I work for a law firm that does a lot of real estate deals, some worth over $1 billion, and I almost never see anything besides an LLC used when a new entity is needed (there are still some limited partnerships left from projects started many years ago).

    A corporation is probably the worst entity, because of the double taxation. 
    
    Separate entities for your operating business and your real estate is recommended also.  This isolates liability caused by your real estate (e.g. a slip and fall) from your operating business, and also protects your real estate from being seized to satisfy a claim due to your operating business (e.g. a product liability claim).

     It's also wise to have each piece of property under a separate LLC.  This way, a catastrophic loss at one property (e.g. a tenant is murdered and you're sued for wrongful death for providing inadequate security), won't decimate your entire real estate portfolio.  All the plaintiff will be able to take is the one property--your other properties will be safe in their own LLCs.</td>

<td>Share investments are essentially purchasing and selling company shares with the goal of making a profit. By buying shares, you can make a profit in two ways:
a. Dividends (income earned from owning a part of a company)
b. Capital growth (increases in share prices)

The major benefit in investing in shares is that it gives, on average, higher returns than most other forms of investments such as property and fix interest. Another benefit of shares would be the biannual payments of dividends, which are usually franked. This means that you don't need to pay tax on your dividends, which offers benefits to people in high tax brackets. 
The downside of shares is that it is extremely risky and susceptible to economic movements. For this reason, most people diversify and buy a portfolio of good performing shares or invest in managed funds.</td>

First, there is no way to predict how much money you will make or lose in the stock market. Over time, there are different approaches that have worked. Even 5 years is a short amount of time for a stock portfolio.

Don't give up though. There are lots of other ways to make money. If you are a parent you most likely know something about babies. You probably have other talents as well. Search eBay for products you might be able to make yourself and sell. I think baby clothes and toys have great potential.

Working another job is a good idea too. Might be hard to spend more time away from your kids.

Also, make every dollar you have now go as far as possible.
Do you have the best insurance rates? Lowerst possible bank fees? Is there any luxuries you could do without until you achieve your goal? Public transit, bagged lunches and coffee from home in a thermos are all examples.

Also, learn about real estate power of sales and foreclosures. If you are frugal and smart, you can pick up properties cheaply. Stay away from brokers and houses marketed to first time home buyers if you can. Talk with a good home inspector too.

Supporting a family on one wage is a challenging proposition. The temptation to just give up is strong. I applaud you for thinking ahead and starting a plan! There are thousands of examples of people in your position going on to enjoy financial freedom.

One thing I'll warn you against is basically you are paying them to give you a website that is EXACTLY what other of their customers have, with the same EXACT products as the other members. How do you expect to earn money from that?

Take a look at their sample store pages and the first two sites they feature http://www.ecashstreet.com/?pg=samples

One thing that jumped at me is that these two pages look VASTLY DIFFERENT from the screenshot in the sample pages page of ecashstreet.com. Greatfindsbyshari.com on the sample page looks very professional with a woman standing in the top middle - but clicking on the site goes to a drab looking template and the only sign of greatfindsbyshari.com is the logo.

I say stay away with it. You are not going to make money by signing up with them. Having the same replica website offering the same exact products with hundreds or thousands of other websites is the surest way to lose money on the Web.</td>

It does not include private companies.

An index provides a measure of the capital return of the companies contained within it.  It is the equivalent return as buying shares in the 500 constituents in the same proportions as the weighting of the free float market cap.

Free float means shares available to public investors.  For example, a company owned 80% by a family and 20% by public investors is only weighted at 20% of its full market cap.

The index does not include the effects of dividends and therefore only shows a "capital return" not a "total return".

The index also has nothing to do with the Dow Jones Industrial Average as preported by trin in a previous answer.   Indeed, all of the 30 companies in the DJIA are also contained within the S&amp;P 500.</td>

Chevron-a US co-may make billions-the CEO etc. get big bonuses-but unless you buy &amp; sell at just the right moment-you-the stockholder-may get 'nuttin'-I'll take cash in my pocket every day,over the ups &amp; downs of the market-that is full of 'wheelers &amp; dealers',more interested in a quick 'fix' return than in serious investing-many of these lose their shirt &amp; lots more.Also use Brownco in Boston as my broker-commissions only 5.00 per trade,and margin rates the lowest in the market. It recently became an ETRADE company-time will tell if stays as good as it has been- I am a retired high school dean &amp; coach-who loves to travel-not a financial planner-hence I want investments I can 'rest easy' with,not lie awake worrying about-I do monitor my positions every day-aside from that buy a good energy sevice mutual fund-several on the market-one of mine went tp 100&amp; this past year.</td>

<td>You have enough money when the interest, or return, on your money is enough to meet all of your daily needs.  At that point your money "works for you", instead of you working for your money.  At that point you are financially free.  This also means that you must know how to manage your money, so you continue to get a good return on it, and don't waste it.  It takes most people many years to get to this point.  It also usually means educating yourself on how to invest and manage money.</td>

<td>1. An area of the economy in which businesses share the same or a related product or service.

2. A group of securities in the same industry or market.  

   
 1. Dividing an economy into different like pieces allows for more in-depth analysis of the economy as a whole. Any economy can be divided into sectors, such as the economy of a particular city, or the global economy. The oil and gas sector is an example of an economic sector. 

2. It is common for analysts to specialize in certain sectors. For example, at a large research firm, an analyst may cover only pharmaceutical companies. Investment funds often specialize in a particular economic sector, a practice known as sector investing.  

When you analyze a specific sector of the market, you are concentrating on a particular market niche.  For example, biotechnology, mecial instruments and devices, financial services, etc. are all sectors of the market.  Instead of concetrating on one particular stock, you are concentrating on a larger piece.</td>

<td>what are the physical significance of moving average covergent divergent?</td>
<td>here goes the definition of "moving average convergent divergent"
A trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the "signal line", is then plotted on top of the MACD, functioning as a trigger for buy and sell signals.  
Personally, I think there is just "Hot-Air" behind technical analysis. It does not even rely on statistical time-series analsysis, fourier transforms or anything with enough theoretical support.
Look at this: you are substracting a longer (lagged) Moving average from a shorter (also lagged) moving average. Thus, by construction, when the stock HAS BEEN rising the shorter MA is higher than the longer one and thus the difference is positive. The contrary is also true: the difference will be negative if the stock HAS BEEN decreasing.
Now, from that to prediction, there is a long long long long long way.
I insist: it's HOT AIR</td>

Toronto is a good market. It differs from other real estate hot spots in that Ontario is flat and open. The urban sprawl can expand almost limitlessly. In Vancouer, for example, there is much less land avaialble for new building.

Interest rates are rising through the world. Further tightening could easily send real estate prices lower. Nothing is certain though. Do your research.

The ones who will have luxurious lives are defintely those who study hard and get good results, while the other group are those that are lazy and have a couldnt be bothered attitude and they resulted in that type of lives when they grow up.The push from parents to study hard and get good results  is surely a very important part of investment in their children's future. My siblings are very good example of my parents investment in them and now they are successful professionals, like doctor,dentist, lawyer..My parents used to keep us in a study room after our favouraite TV programes every night from 8pm-10pm.But they left to us to decide the courses we decided to take.

We beleive that someone out there is going to be so stupid and take paper from us and give us something in return.  I mean think about it.  There are people out there that are willing to work for you and all you have to do is give them a piece of paper in return for their efforts.  They in turn will run out and give others pieces of paper in return for things they need.  Round and Round the wheels on the bus go.  

Sound strange?  Not really if you think about it.  Money has no real value.  The only value that money has is that we believe we can exchange it for things that we need.

Of course for you business minds out there, I will include that money is the following:  

ETYMOLOGY:  Middle English moneie, from Old French, from Latin mon ta, mint, coinage, from Mon ta, epithet of Juno, temple of Juno of Rome where money was coined.”
   
The definition of money has been defined as a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account.  As a medium of exchange, money easily transfers for goods, services or ideals.  Money stores its value as long as the belief system that money can be exchanged for something else holds true in the future.  Money gives us a way of accounting for items.  For example, you can have $3,000.00 of elephants in your closet and that would be a widely understood meaning because most people through out the world use money.  Money must be portable, divisible, durable and stable.

Money is exchanged, transferred, stored, created and controlled by various financial institutions located through out the world.  The term M1 and M2 come into play here, but this is getting too long for Yahoo! Answers.  Such financial institutions include; commercial banks that take deposits of money, and in turn use the profits to make loans for profit.  Savings and Loan Associations (S&amp;Ls) take deposits for the primary reason of making profit on loans from mortgages.  Mutual Savings Banks turn all depositors into owners of the bank.  Dividing profits from operations among the owners or deposit holders.  Credit Unions are restricted to members, usually of organizations such as schools, unions or associations.  The Federal Reserve System or simply The Fed controls the money in the United States of America.  The Fed sets monetary policy with the main goals being employment and inflation control.  In addition to these banks, there are The World Bank and the IMF.
  
Neither of these organizations are actually banks as we know of them in the traditional sense.  They are however agencies within the United Nations.  The World Bank provides a limited range of services mainly focused in financing international trade.  They provide money for schools, power plants, hospitals, and infrastructure.  The IMG (International Monetary Fund) is composed of 184 countries that work for the stability of exchange rates, provide short-term loans to member countries, work for monetary cooperation among members and work out payments among member countries.

<td>what is the disadvantage of corvered call?</td>
<td>The disadvantage is if the stock makes a big move above your strike price.  If the stock makes a big move up above your strike price than you have limited your gain.  Your max profit is strike price + the premium.  For example, you buy a stock at $30 and sell the $35 call for $1, and the stock goes to $100.  Your maximum profit = $35 (strike price)- $30 (purchase price) + $1 (premium) = $6.  You would have given the other $64 profit to the call buyer.

Another disadvantage is limited down side protection.  Using the example above, your cost basis on the stock becomes $30 - $1 (the premium) or $29.  So you are only protected to the downside by $1.  If the stock drops, and you decide to get out, you will also have another commission to buy back the call.</td>

<td>what are the differences between asset management and investment banking?</td>
<td>Asset management and investment banking are basically opposites of one another.  Asset management = "Buy Side" and Investment Banking = "Sell Side".  These are the terms that are used on Wall Street.

Here's an example that may help you to understand the difference.  (keep in mind these numbers are totally made up!)

Let's say that IBM wants to buy Intel for $500 million dollars but they don't have the cash to do this...so what do they do?  Well, one thing they can do is go to their trusty investment bankers (Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns, etc.) and say "Hey investment banker, how do we get this $500 million dollars"?  So the investment bankers will do some work (due diligence, research, etc) and come up with the idea that IBM should sell $500 million of debt.  So then the bankers do some more work and the Company pitches the deal to potential accounts (clients, investors,etc).  This is why investment banking is called the sell side.

Ok, so now we know that Morgan Stanley has done its work and IBM is ready to sell $500 million of bonds.  Well, who do they sell to?  This is where asset management comes in (and asset management is a very broad term).  Basically asset managers are people that manage money for institutions, individuals, companies, etc.  The figure out where to invest money.  In this IBM example, asset managers who invest in corporate bonds (like IBM) might be interested in buying some of the issue (the issue = $500mm that IBM is seeking).  This is the reason asset management is oftern referred to as the buy side.

There are other differences between investment banking and asset management since the example I gave you is a very narrow focussed answer...but I think it should give you at least somewhat of an idea as to the difference.</td>

<td>I have $2000 to put away for my 2 kids. I want to save the money for their education. their age is 3 and 6?</td>
<td>Try a 529 College Savings Plan. 

You can specify what kind of investment you want (guaranteed plan gives you a specific amount of growth per year, age-based changes every three years to a more conservative portfolio, a combination of these, etc.), you can change the beneficiary at any time, and it's tax-deductible. Then, when the kids are of age and wish to remove the money (for education purposes only, which is the part that can be a catch if the kids don't go to college), it's tax-free if the money is used for education purposes. These "purposes" can be anything from books to tuition to housing. Even if they don't go to college right away, the money can be withdrawn from the account until they're 29. 

The only down side, other than the catch I already mentioned, is that you can only have one beneficiary per account, so you could either put all your money in one account and pick which kid is the beneficiary (which you can change if that kid doesn't go to college or when he/she is halfway through... whenever), or you can split the money and give each kid their own account. 

Hope this helps!</td>

Candlestick charts are on record as being the oldest type of charts used for price prediction. They date back to the 1700's, when they were used for predicting rice prices. In fact, during this era in Japan, Munehisa Homma become a legendary rice trader and gained a huge fortune using candlestick analysis. He is said to have executed over 100 consecutive winning trades!

The candlesticks themselves and the formations they shape were give colorful names by the Japanese traders. Due in part to the military environment of the Japanese feudal system during this era, candlestick formations developed names such as "counter attack lines" and the "advancing three soldiers". Just as skill, strategy, and psychology are important in battle, so too are they important elements when in the midst of trading battle.</td>

<td>If I invest in a 401K, can I invest in a IRA too.?</td>

At certatin income levels, the amount that you can deduct starts "phasing out".  Go to http://www.irs.gov and download publication 590.  It has all of the info including a worksheet, chart and table that shows the phase outs.

If it is not tax deductible for you, and you still want to put away money in a tax favored account, I would recommend a Roth IRA.  You fund a Roth with after tax $$, so there is no tax deduxtion today, but the account grows tax free.  There is never tax paid on the growth or the distributions.  Another benefit is the Government doesn't force you to take it out at 70 1/2.  

If you already made your traditional contribution, but want to change it to a Roth contribution or vice versa, you can.  It is called recharecterization.  Call the financial institution that holds your account and tell them that you want to recharecterize your IRA contribution.  They will have a simple form to fill out.

All of the above info is in publication 590 also.</td>

-Potential for current owners or management to lose control of the company through a takeover
-Having to pay listing fees, investment banker fees for the IPO (initial public offering), etc

<td>Corporate Notes and Bonds  

GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
Corporate bonds are debt obligations issued by corporations. Corporate bonds may be either secured or unsecured. Collateral used for secured debt includes but is not limited to real property, machinery, equipment, accounts receivable, stocks, bonds, or notes. If the debt is unsecured, the bonds are known as debentures Bondholders, as creditors, have a prior legal claim over common and preferred stockholders as to both income and assets of the corporation for the principal and interest due them and may have a prior claim over other creditors if liens or mortgages are involved. Corporate bonds contain elements of both interest-rate risk and credit risk. Corporate bonds usually yield more than government or agency bonds due to the presence of credit risk. Corporate bonds are issued as registered bonds and are usually sold in book-entry form. Interest may be fixed, floating, or the bonds may be zero-coupons. Interest on corporate bonds is typically paid semiannually and is fully taxable to the bondholder.

 

CHARACTERISTICS AND FEATURES 

Security for Bonds 

Various types of security may be pledged to offer security beyond that of the general standing of the issuer. Secured bonds, such as first-mortgage bonds, collateral trust bonds, and equipment trust certificates, yield a lower rate of interest than comparable unsecured bonds because of the greater security they provide to the bondholder.

First-Mortgage Bonds 

First-mortgage bonds normally grant the bond holder a first-mortgage lien on the property of the issuer. Often first-mortgage bonds are issued in series with bonds of each series secured equally by the same first mortgage. 

Collateral Trust Bonds 

Collateral trust bonds are secured by pledges of stocks, notes, bonds, or other collateral. Generally, the market or appraised value of the collateral must be maintained at some percentage of the amount of the bonds outstanding, and a provision for withdrawal of some collateral is often included, provided other acceptable collateral is provided. Collateral trust bonds may be issued in series. 

Equipment Trust Certificates 

Equipment trust certificates are usually issued by railroads or airlines. The issuer, such as a railroad company or airline, buys a piece of equipment from a manufacturer, who transfers the title to the equipment to a trustee. The trustee then leases the equipment to the issuer and at the same time sells equipment trust certificates (ETCs) to investors. The manufacturer is paid off through the sale of the certificates, and interest and principal are paid to the bondholders through the proceeds of lease payments from the issuer to the trustee. At the end of some specified period of time, the certificates are paid off, the trustee sells the equipment to the issuer for a nominal price, and the lease is terminated. As the issuer does not own the equipment, foreclosing a lien in event of default is facilitated. These bonds are often issued in serial form. 

Debenture Bonds 

Debenture bonds are not secured by a specific pledge of designated property. Debenture bond-holders have the claim of general creditors on all assets of the issuer not pledged specifically to secure other debt. They also have a claim on pledged assets to the extent that these assets have value greater than necessary to satisfy secured creditors. Debentures often contain a variety of provisions designed to afford some degree of protection to bondholders, including limitation on the amount of additional debt issuance, minimum maintenance requirements on net workingcapital, and limits on the payment of cash dividends by the issuer. If and issuer has no secured debt, it is customary to provide a negative pledge clause-a provision that debentures will be secured equally with any secured bonds that may be issued in the future.

As a result of this the main Chinese stock exchange (The Shanghai Composite) has rallied from 1,060 to 1,250 (17.9%) compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (which has increased from 10,390 to 11,021 in the same time frame (+6.1%)).

When GOOG came out with their last earnings report, the CFO said that because of the size of the company now, that it would be impossible for GOOG to continue to grow at the previous growth rates.  That started the decline.  The CFO then stated the same thing in the companies 10Q (quarterly report that is filed with the SEC) and then again at an investor conference.

<td>Hi, I didn't see your original post so I don't know how liquid you'd like the funds to be.  If you don't need to draw out money frequently, you can probably get the best short-term rates with Certificates of Deposit (CDs) which are available at most banks and savings/loan institutions.  You can split the money up and open a number of accounts over different time periods so that at least one reaches maturity every month, every few months, or whatever period you choose.  When an account reaches maturity you can take some of the money out, add funds, change the investment period, or withdraw the total and close the account.  Most have minimum deposit amounts required, so you just need to make sure you don't withdraw too much if you want the account to remain open.  If you want more liquidity, then yes, money market accounts are much better than regular savings accounts in terms of interest, and the on-line accounts seem to offer the best rates.</td>

A back-end fee (or back-end load) is a percentage that's deducted only when you sell a mutual fund.  If you sell shares worth $100 and the back-end fee is 2%, then you will receive $98.00.

<td>what is the difference in pre-tax contributions and after tax Roth contributions?</td>
<td>Pre tax contributions, like those to a 401k or a traditional IRA, are deductible off the current year's taxes.  So, if you made $100k this year, and you put in $10k to your 401k, than you are now only taxed on $90k.  The catch is that when you take the money out in retirement, you will pay tax then.

After tax contributions, like to a ROTH IRA, are not deductible on this year's taxes.  So if you made $100k this year, and you put in $4000 (the max) into your ROTH IRA, then you still get taxed on all $100k.  The good thing is that you don't pay any taxes your whole ROTH balance, contribution and earnings alike.  So when you see your balance of your ROTH, that's what you can take out, no taxes.

You can buy and sell all you want as quickly as you want you just have to meet SEC requirnments. There are basically two laws that apply here, the settlement one and a day trading one. the settlement one has been covered by "only init 4 profit" and the daytrading one just states that no more than 3 day trades can be made within 4 business days. Now the law also says that you can have permission to get around them if you meet certain requirnments, they simply are to have a margin account type with a minimum of $25,000 in the account at all times. If it goes below 25,000 you have to stop making more than 3 trades within 4 busibness days untill it gose back over the 25,000 mark. also by having a margin account you never have to worry about the settlement dates no matter what the account value is.
 
Also if you are looking for an online broker, I use Scottrade, they are very cheep $7 trades for market and limit orders.

Hope this helps.</td>

If you only focus on the earnings part of the formula, you will miss half of the equation.  You have more control over what you do with your money.  If you spend less on useless/worthless crap, you have more money to put to work for you.

Try reading about budgets (I know, BORING!, but crucial!) and living below your means.  The Motley Fool is a great resource for learning about personal finance (fool.com), so is your local library (FREE!).

One last thought, high returns often come with high risk.  If your goal is to get rich quick, be prepared to get poor quick first.  I prefer the get rich slow method.  I use rental real estate, mutual funds (Vanguard.com), and individual stocks (interactivebrokers.com), but first I invested in my education, and then cut my expenses drastically.  I suggest you read more and think about doing the same.

<td>why has the stock price in Humana Inc been dropping recently.?</td>
<td>The stock market is simply a meeting place of buyers and sellers.

The price at which stocks are sold is simply where they agree on the value of that stock.

If there are an equal number of buyers and sellers with an equal proportion of sentiment then the price will never change.

When a stock price changes it's because there is an oversupply of buyers or sellers.

So in the case of a stock price dropping, more people want to sell than buy and therefore the price is pushed down by those sellers until it reaches a new equilibrium.

The cause of people selling is varied.  Some people sell because of a bad newspaper article.  Some people sell because they want to buy a new car.  Some mutual funds sell because of a reweighting of their portfolio.  Some traders sell because a particular level has been reached.  Some people sell because of change in the fundamentals of the company (sales, profits, market competition etc.).  There's probably another 100 reasons that could be added here.

One thing about the market is that it's like a herd and often movements cause more movements in the same direction.

You should do the following:
1) Specify (model) your problem
2) See what data you can count on. If necessary, go to step 
3) research what methods are there available for solving your problem

i) Create an attractive website which has displays of the products or brochures of the services that you plan to offer.
ii) Get a portal that supports credit card transactions and embed it on your website.
2- Now if you are planning to work as a freelance keep the following things in mind
i) Don't go for free sites .. they might take ages to give you any money for your efforts
ii) Don't pay too high of a price but do get a membership that costs between $30 to $40. 
iii) Don't go for any Tom, Dick and Harry website. Ask your friends for references. If they had good experience with any freelance work provider, go for it.

IRR is the Internal Rate of Return.  Here we're looking for a percentage rate where a future stream of payments will equal an outlay of money today.  The money today is considered period zero. It's similiar to NPV but here we're looking for the rate, whereas in NPV we provide the rate.</td>

Do you want to spend your time researching fundamentals of a company: earnings, balance sheets, products, competition, cash flows, etc., when this really doesn't tell you a lot about the direction of the stock price? 

Do you really want to take the advice of a broker, who is probably terribly biased, doesn't know any more than you do about the company, and doesn't have a clue where the stock price is going, but really just wants to earn a commission by making a sale, and whom is just a good salesman?

Or maybe you want to investigate Technical Analysis to determine key turning points in stocks or the market. Get ready for a long learning curve. 

Or, you could try stock options, like me, and lose your whole IRA. And then come back and try Day Trading, and lose it all again. Then try Index Futures, and leverage it all away again. I finally got it right, but it took about eight years.

Most people spend more time deciding the color of their new car than they do on deciding on a stock, a broker, a mutual fund, or other investment. If you don't put quite a bit of time into it, don't expect to make a decent return on your "investment."

Check out someone who rates mutual funds. There are a few good ones out there, and it's their job to know what's going on, what's moving and what isn't, and a whole team of people will be watching over your investment every day.

<td>Current price: $50.61 // intrinsic value price: $43.77

OVERVALUED 

Given a 30% earnings growth rate (analyst average) and a 17% discount rate (risk free bond rate + 6% risk premium)  FMCN must grow earnings at a rate of 32.0% annually for 10 years to justify its current stock price of $50.61. However, it is difficult to establish a long term growth rate for a company with less than 5 years of reported earnings.  

If we assume initial earnings of $23.4 million grow at a rate of 30.00%, and we discount those future earnings at a rate of 17.00%, we arrive at a net present value for the company's next 10 years of earnings of $437 million. To account for potential earnings beyond the 10th year, we estimate a growth rate of 6.00%, a discount rate of 12.00%, and we arrive at a continuing value of $1.19 billion. To complete the calculation we add these two figures together, subtract the long-term debt for FMCN ($0), and divide by the outstanding shares (37.1 million) to get a per share intrinsic value of $43.77

Gauging the future growth and risk outlook of a company such as FMCN, however, is more art than science. New products, management, or strategic directions can fuel growth far above historic norms. Likewise, unforeseen setbacks can cut a company's future value in half.

<td>what is stoke market and how can someone benefit from it?</td>
<td>Stocks are shares of ownership in companies.  The stock market is where people buy and sell shares of stock in those companies that have chosen to sell shares of ownership in their company to the public.

If you buy stock in a company, you make money when the shares go up in value, which they generally do when the company does well.  You can make money because of the increase in value and also from the dividends paid by the company to shareholders if it's a company that pays dividends.

There are many different ways you can profit in the stock market.  It can get complicated and there's a lot to learn.  There are conservative ways to invest in the stock market and very risky ways to invest.  Of course, the riskier ways will generally make you more money if your bet is correct but can also cause you to lose more money.  There are even ways to make money when stocks go down, not just up.

If you're interested in making money in the stock market, there's a lot to learn and winning at it consistently is not easy.  But it's certainly possible if you get really good at it... and are lucky, too.

If you're interested in it, I suggest you start by buying books on the subject.  As a total beginner, just about any beginner's book on the subject that has good customer ratings on Amazon.com would be a good start to kinda see if this is something you might be interested in.

I have a habit of getting interested in things and then after spending a lot of time really learning about it, it kinda loses its luster and I lose interest.  But you sure end up smarter even if you change your mind.

If you do get into it, I wish you lotsa luck!</td>

<td>Is the Iraqi Dinar really a good investment?</td>
<td>NO. It is likely to be a really poor investment. 

The dinar is traded on one exchange at the Iraqi National Bank. They have currently allowed both Kuwaiti and Jordanian banks to accept and distribute dinars, in order to accomodate contractors working in Iraq. Other than these three countries there are no international banks that can accept dinars in exchange for any other currency. 

The value of the dinar has remained unchanged since the exchange began several years ago, and fluctuates only by about 1% from 1476 dinars to the US dollar. This hardly appears to be a free exchange, and appears to be controlled by the US government which has a vested interest in maintaining a stable currency exchange value for the contractors working in Iraq. The only values that fluctuate are the exchange values for other currencies, these are determined by the changes in the value of the US dollar against those currencies. 

It appears likely to me that the Iraqi dinar will end up being tied to a fixed value against the US dollar, or perhaps a basket of the other internationally traded currencies. There are many countries that tie their currency exchange value to another currency. If this happens, and you were expecting to make a US dollar profit on your dinar investment, you will be out of luck, because you may have no opportunity for any relative appreciation.

Finally, if the dinar were allowed to float on the exchange markets it is likely that it will fall precipitously. The unemployment rate in Iraq is often quoted as near 50%. The economy is going to be dependent on a badly damaged oil sector that currently is not producing as much oil as it was before the war, and is barely managing to produce more than the internal demand for oil products. Much of the exports of Iraqi oil you hear about are offset by importing refined oil products from other countries in the region. As long as there is unstability in the country the oil sector cannot recover, because drilling wells and exploring for oil cannot be accomplished where they will be targeted by snipers or bombers. It may be decades before Iraq recovers economically. 

Personally, I believe money invested in Dinars is about as likely to make you a profit as money 'invested' in lottery tickets. If you can afford to lose it, you might get lucky, but it is NOT an INVESTMENT.</td>

<td>how does rent to own in Calgary, Alberta work?</td>
<td>R2Own works just like renting but you typically pay a non refundable option fee up front vs. paying a security deposit and you also agree on the purchase price up front. While renting, you usually have 12-18 months to actually get a loan and buy the house. If you don't buy in the 12-18 month window you loose the option to buy and your option fee. Also, a portion of your rent can go towards the purchase price($100 per month) when you go to get a loan and actual take complete title.</td>

Here is how it works.

Let's say you want to short the dollar.
Forex only allows you to make money if the Euro rises against the dollar.

Buying Euro stocks not only gives you the advantage of that rising Euro, the stocks could go up and you will be making money off of that too.  If the stocks goes up and the Euro goes down against the dollar, it's still possible to make money along with the Euro going up and the stocks going down.</td>

Also, whether it is better to be saving pre-tax (401(k)/IRA) vs. post-tax (Roth IRA) is a question that can't be answered easily.  Having some of both is probably best.  It is definitely a good idea to see a financial advisor or certified financial planner you know or trust.

Once you are saving, at age 27, you should then invest in a diverse portfolio of stocks.  Make sure whoever you are investing with is giving you good advice by checking with others and reading up on the 'net, and don't be afraid to ask how they get paid and demand an answer.

Good luck.</td>

Government bond yields are usually used.  Then check the tables found in the NPV charts.  Do a Internet search for NPV Tables to find a chart.  You need Interest Rate and time (10 Years in your case).  The charts are for 1 Dollar (or 1 Pound or 1 anything).  Multiply the factor by your money amount.  That's all there is to it!</td>

<td>If General Motors files bankruptcy will the United States government bail them out? INTELLIGENT ANSWERS ONLY!!</td>
<td>General Motors won't file for bankruptcy EVER.

On March 27, 1999 Nissan (From Japan) and Renault (From France) signed an agreement to create the fourth largest car company in the World.

At that time Nissan had a debt of $16.7 Billion (If you wanted to buy GM today it will cost you less than $13 Billion)

Renault invested $5 Billion in exchange for 36.8% of Nissan and 22.5% of Nissan Diesel.

Renault also purchased the European Financial Subsidiaries of Nissan for $320 Million.

To stop the losses Carlos Ghosn (Executive Vice President of Renault at that time) took over as COO of Nissan.

Renault also got two seats at the Board of Directors at Nissan.

Yoshikazu Hanawa (President and CEO of Nissan at that time) was also promoted to the Board of Directors of Renault.

All this moves saved Nissan from bankruptcy.

If I am mistaken and GM files for bankruptcy the United States of America Government WON'T BAIL General Motors or Ford.

In 1979 the United States of America Government saved Chrysler with $1.5 Billion in loan guarantees.

It was a lot of money back then and Chrylser could not survive.

In 1998 Daimler-Benz (From Germany) bought Chrysler.

Today the company is called Daimler Chrysler.

Therefore the United States of America Government won't make the same mistake twice.

General Motors has plenty of things to sell like the brands Vauxhall,  Holden, Saturn or Saab.

It can reduce its stake in Isuzu from 8% to 3%
It can sell or close its Allison Transmission Factory in Indianapolis, Indiana (Open since 1915)
AC Delco no longer exists today, however, GM still has the right to the brand and it could sell it.</td>

Reasons for investing in China:
1) Huge population base leading to cheap labour;
2) Huge potential market for your products;
3) If you want to invest safely, go to the big cities instead of the rural ones;
4) It has had double digit GDP growth for the past 20 years;
5) Be sure to read your partners mind....they may see things and describe issues differently from yourself.

<td>money market mutuals funds are invested in a variety of short term corporate &amp; government notes. they fund takes a small percentage for managing the money. some money market funds are US Treasury only funds and invest in government obligations only. some invest only in municipal bonds to gain the tax free status.

the risk is that some of the investments default and the share price is not held at a constant $1.00.. you would lose money in that case. Most major fund companies would never let that happen to a money market fund as it would kill off most of their business. they have and would add the extra cash to keep the net asset value at $1.00.

moral of the story, buy money market funds from the best companies, vanguard.com, fidelity.com, troweprice.com, schwab.com ,etc.</td>

KUWAIT CITY (AFP) - Hundreds of disgruntled Kuwaiti investors protested peacefully outside the emirate's stock exchange as the bourse index recorded its largest single-day drop.

The Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) Index closed the day's trading down 257.8 points or 2.4 percent on the previous day's close, but at one point lost about 450 points, four percent, its biggest drop in one day of trading.

KSE Index finished the week through Wednesday at 10,705 points, down 6.7 percent on last week's close of 11,467.50 points. The Index has not gained since February 21.

The protestors, mostly small investors who lost heavily over the past four weeks, accused "big players" of deliberately causing the index to dive.</td>

<td>What do the numbers on a schedule K-1 for Limited Partnerships mean?</td>
<td>What tax form will I get if I invest in a partnership?

If you have invested in a partnership, its management should send you IRS Form 1065, Schedule K-1. This tells you what your share of the partnership’s income, credits, deductions and tax-preference items is. Don’t attach Form 1065 Schedule K-1 to your income tax returns; instead, keep it for your records.

Are limited partnerships publicly traded or privately held?

There are two basic types of limited partnerships: direct participation programs (DPPs) and master limited partnerships (MLPs.)

Direct participation programs are private limited partnerships where the units can’t be traded very easily. This kind of investment is designed to be held long term until the partnership terminates -- after 10 to 15 years or longer.

Master limited partnerships, on the other hand, are partnerships that are publicly traded. Shares in these partnerships are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and other exchanges. As a result, they are more liquid than DPPs but less liquid than conventional publicly traded securities.</td>

<td>what are PowerRatings?</td>
<td>In brief PowerRatings are a proprietary stock rating method which ranks stocks 1-10. The higher the rating, the greater the one week historical gain has been for stocks with that rating.

One more interesting fact about the PowerRatings; PowerRatings of 1 and 2 have on average lost money over the next week. A PowerRating of 1 has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a nearly 5-1 margin. Obviously, you should ideally be looking to be buying high PowerRating stocks and avoid (or short) low PowerRatings stocks. Stocks that are closer to the "10" mark.

As far as is known, no other quantified rating method exists with this type of performance. There is no guarantee that past results will continue in the future. Also, you should do your homework on any stock before doing any transaction.

Here is an interesting chart involving PowerRatings:

Performance Versus the S&amp;P 1995-2005

If it's in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds remember markets go up and down. But over time you are virtually guaranteed to make a return greater than that of a cd.

<td>how do i get started in investing money?</td>
<td>You want to first decide on your priorities:
Most working people in their 20's or 30's use the following criteria:
First, take advantage of your 401K plan at work. You want to invest the percentage of your gross income that matches what the company will do for you. For example, if the company matches dollar for dollar upto 10%, or 50 cents to the dollar up to 10%, then that's how much you want to allocate in your 401K. 

Second, once your 401K matches your employer's contribution, take extra money and put it into an IRA (Traditional or Roth). You can open one through any broker or financial institution, including banks. We like Vanguard because of it's lower annual fee. You can contribute upto $4,000 or $5,000 for 2006. You should take advantage of this tax-deferred growth!

Third, once you have maxed out your IRA for 2006, you'll want to max out your 401K beyond your employer's contribution. That is, even though your employer may match upto 10%, you may be able to allocate 15% or even 20-25%. Even though your employer won't match the full amount, you can still allocate your gross income, which is great!

Finally, after you've taken care of your 401K and IRA, you'll want to put money into a taxable investment account. Unlike the IRA, you will pay taxes immediately on capital gains. But, you can play around with stocks and make money. If you watch the markets and keep up with your research, you may want to buy and sell stocks yourself. We like Scottrade-the online broker-for this service because of the low fees. Some people prefer to go through SmithBarney, or Merrill Lynch or some other broker to trade for them. They are more costly, but you don't have to watch stocks daily and do it yourself.</td>

What u r talking abt is Section 80C. Employee's Contribution to EPF is included in Section 80C and so the overall limit of Rs 1 lakh is applicable to it and not exclusive of it.

<td>Factoring is a process for financing (frequently a startup) business. A "Factor" will buy your accounts receivables. So, for example, if you sell a product or service with time payments to the purchaser, a Factor will buy the stream of monthly payments (the contract) with a lump sum payment up front.

If the Factor buys the payments unconditionally and then if the payor doesn't pay it is the Factor's loss. While this sounds like a better solution for the company selling their contracts, there is more risk for the Factor so they will pay less, all else equal.

If the company selling the contracts is responsible to make good (or buy back) a contract if it is non-paying, that is conditional factoring.

A "better" way to finance a business is usually to simply borrow money from a bank (or a family member or perhaps a low interest credit card). But if those options are not available to you, a Factor is not an unreasonable solution. From their perspective it is a loan secured by the contract purchased and they can see where the money to pay the loan is coming from.</td>

<td>why a dealer would have different prices for buying and selling options?</td>
<td>Dealers have diffrent prices for buying and selling every marketable security. The price at which a dealer is selling at and an investors buys at is the "ASK" price and the price that the dealer buys and the investor sells is call the "BID" price. The same dealers might be willing to purchase 10,000 shares of stock in ABC at 9.46 and might be will to sell 10,000 at 9.48. So not taking into accout other dealer prices or quantities, the BID would equal 9.46 and the ASK would equal 9.48 and the BID size would be 100 and the ASK size would be 100.  The BID and ASK sizes are always shouwn in 100s so a BID size of 100 = 10,000. 

As for options or any other marketable security it is exactly the same way. Dealers do this because it is how they make money, and in return for paying the diffrence in the BID and ASK prices investors get guaranteed liquidity in return.</td>

<td>What is the difference between common and preferred stocks? Which one should I buy? Please help i'm confused .</td>
<td>Preferred and common stocks are different in two key aspects.

First, preferred stockholders have a greater claim to a company's assets and earnings. This is true during the good times when the company has excess cash and decides to distribute money in the form of dividends to its investors. In these instances when distributions are made, preferred stockholders must be paid before common stockholders. However, this claim is most important during times of insolvency when common stockholders are last in line for the company's assets. What this means is that when the company must liquidate and pay all creditors and bondholders, common stockholders will not receive any money until after the preferred shareholders are paid out.

Second, the dividends of preferred stocks are different from and generally greater than those of common stock. When you buy a preferred stock, you will have an idea of when to expect a dividend because they are paid at regular intervals. This is not necessarily the case for common stock, as the company's board of directors will decide whether or not to pay out a dividend. Because of this characteristic, these stocks typically don't fluctuate as often as a company's common stock and can sometimes be classified as a fixed-income security. Adding to this fixed-income personality is the fact that the dividends are typically guaranteed, meaning that if the company does miss one, it will be required to pay it before any future dividends are paid on any stock.

To sum up: a good way to think of a preferred stock is as a security with characteristics somewhere in-between a bond and a common stock.</td>

<td>tell me about how to calculate the valuation of company to know the value of company equity?</td>
<td>Hi,
Your question is somewhat confusing. If you are talking about stockholder's equity or book value of the company then that can be found at the bottom of the balance sheet.

But if you are trying to find out the stock price of the company then there are different ways you can do it. One of the common ways used by Analysts is called the dividend discount model.

As we all know that the final motive of any business is to generate cash. So the business that generates more cash can distribute more of it to the investors.....well that's commonsense you must be saying......so is the stock valuation.

The Dividend discount model is nothing more than the discounted values of all the cash flows generated by the investment.

Inputs Into the DDM 
Several inputs are required to estimate the value of an equity using the DDM. 

DPS(1) = Dividends expected to be received in one year. 
Ks = The required rate of return for the investment. The required rate of return can be estimated using the following formula: Risk-free rate + (Market risk premium) * Beta 
The rate on t-bills can be used to determine the risk-free rate. The market risk premium is the expected return of the market in excess of the risk-free rate. Beta can be thought of as the sensitivity of the stock compared with the market. 
g = Growth rate in dividends 

Now let us take example of Caterpillar company (NYSE : CAT)

Caterpillar has a dividend of $1.30 

Ks = 6% + (6.8%) * 1.0 = 12.8% (we use a Beta of 1 because it should be the same as the market during the stable growth period) 

g = Because the stable model assumes a growth rate equal to the long-term nominal growth of the economy, we will use a growth rate of 6% (3% inflation + 3% GDP growth). 

V = 1.30 * (1.06) / (.1280-.06) 
V = $20.26 

Caterpillar's recent price of $38.63 per share shows that the dividend discount model suggests that Caterpillar is overvalued. However, Caterpillar for example, has a strong brand name, and customers will pay a premium price for its products. This is a good example of how the dividend discount model may understate the intrinsic value of the equity. Adjustments should be made to estimate the value of brand name or other value-enhancing traits that a company may possess. 

But the most important thing about stock valuation is based upon how people percieve its growth.

So it finally boils down to perception. But it is true that in long run ONLY a company with strong fundamentals would keep up with its valuation.

Thanks,
Dan</td>

<td>If the US dollar is devalued by 40% as a result of the Iranian Bourse, how will this affect your investments?</td>
<td>I stopped investing in US dollar denominated assets some time ago. As someone in the oil business I have been expecting the oil trade to eventually begin using the Euro, and believe that in effect it already has. I think that oil has no chance of any significant price decrease until the dollar strengthens proportionally. With the twin deficits as large as they are there is little chance of this. 

I used to actively trade the Forex, but changed my strategy to hold foreign securities instead, and have somewhat concentrated on Canada, generally in the energy sector. Both the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar are generally commodity driven and I have benefitted from that move. Real estate has been the only asset in the US I was willing to hold, and I think that price increase has been related to the falling US dollar as well. 

Keep in mind that the US is still the largest buyer of oil in the world, so even if the Euro-oil-trade were to become widespread, it would not change a large portion of the world oil market. Since the Forex is a trillion dollar a day market, it seems unlikely that changing the currency that half of the world’s oil is priced and traded in would have a large effect on the value of the US dollar. I do think it would have a further negative impact on the dollar, but am skeptical of claims that it would be catastrophic. 

There has also been some interesting news recently about petro-dollars being converted to Euros. U.A.E. apparently as a quiet reaction to all the hoopla over the ports deal is switching at least 10% of its holdings away from the US dollar, and it looks like they might not be buying any more Boeing jets.

Let's not forget that Audi's used to be the biggest pile of dung that ever came out of Germany until about fifteen years ago after the line was completly revamped from the ground up and they started producing excellent cars.</td>

2.  What is your goal?
3.  What is the timeframe of the investment?
4.  How much can you afford to lose?
5.  Are you in a high tax bracket?

<td>Should I open an IRA or do some online investing, eg. scottrade etc.?</td>
<td>Yes, paying off your mortgage is the same as getting a 5.8% return on a taxable account. However your IRA account is either tax deductible (deductible traditional IRA) or tax deferred (RothIRA &amp; non-deductible traditional IRA). Therefore, it is very likely that you can earn more on the IRA account. (According to a study by Charles Schwab, a moderate long-term investor can earn around 7% on the average.)

If you open an IRA account with an investment firm (e.g., scottrade), you can buy/sell stocks/mutual funds on-line. Fidelity is my favorite because of the low maintenance fee. Note that hidden fees in another financial firm eat away the value of IRA accounts. http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/15/news/com... Therefore, be careful about where you open your IRA account.</td>

<td>Interesting question - I'm a financial analyst as well

What you learn is that a credit rating or a market perception can help you draw down large credit lines. As what US is doing and many large corporates.

So within my fiedl I would like to be considered a thought leader and hence my investing too would be into areas that are strong on fundementals and be asset driven.

Ie - when you are younger - I would like to have failry less liquidity but more stock in risky but higher return sectors - like tech stocks and real estate and even commodities.

But as I age I would rebalance my portfolio to become less risky by moving more and more funds to fixed deposits and index related funds.

So I would go with my personal funding requirements and then match underlying assets that would provide return-risk profiles acceptable in each area.

Right now I am building a part portfolio in euro to hedge a euro commitment at the latter part of the year.</td>

If you were 50+, I would consider an inflation indexed annuity, as it would yield more than enough money per month to live off off. No risk, no excitement, but no work either.

If you were 40-50, I would consider a laddered set of I-Bonds (5 year bonds purchased so that 20% of them mature each year) with about 50% of the money, and the rest invested in dividend-paying solid companies (direct share ownership or low MER mutual fund). The 50-50 split could be played with depending on your feelings. I am more bearish, so I would go more for the I-Bonds, and less for the stocks.

If you were 20-40, then I would be more speculative. I would put about 25% in the ladered I-Bonds, 25% in high-dividend stocks, 25% gold and silver bullion, and 25% in commodities stocks.

<td>What is the "Rule of Sevens" in Investing?</td>
<td>7% of simple, annual interest takes just over  10 years to double your money.

Are you sure you aren't talking about the Rule of 72?  This means that you divide 72 by your interest rate.  So if you have an interest rate of 6%, it would take 12 years to double your money.  Since 72 divided by the 7 from our first example is 10, it takes a little over 10 years to double your money.

Keep in mind, this actually works well for fairly low interest rates, as the interest rate climbs the imperfections of the formula begin to show.  Another important thing to note is that this is just for simple, annual interest.  If the interest rate is compounded on a different time frame, you should remember to take that into consideration and adjust your timescale accordingly.

If this isn't what you wanted, please clarify your question.</td>

On November 19, 2005, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Mr. Chang-ping Mei, a third party independent of the Company's directors, officers and major shareholder. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to acquire the 100% interest in Golden Harvest Yield Limited ("Golden Harvest"), a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, from Mr. Mei at a cash consideration of $8 million. Golden Harvest signed an operating agreement with Beijing Wei Zhong Hospital to operate the hospital for a term of 15 years starting from January 1, 2002. On August 8, 2005, a business valuation of the operating agreement was carried out by Beijing Jingjiaxin CPA Company Limited. The appraised value of the business, based on the discounted cash flow model is RMB84,164,059 (approximately $10,390,000). 

On November 19, 2005, CCCI entered into another Stock Sale Agreement (the "Sale Agreement") with Mr. Mei. Pursuant to the Sale Agreement, we agreed to sell the 100% interest in Broadway Offshore Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands at a cash consideration of $8 million. The cash consideration payable by Mr. Mei was offset against the cash consideration to be paid by CCCI to Mr. Mei in respect of the Purchase Agreement as mentioned above. Broadway Offshore Limited owned 49% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock on a fully diluted basis of Baoding Pascali Broadcasting Cable Television Integrated Information Networking Co., Ltd.

<td>A commodity is an undifferentiated product whose market value arises from the owner's right to sell rather than the right to use. Example: commodities from the financial world include oil (sold by the barrel), electricity, wheat, bulk chemicals such as sulfuric acid, base and other metals, and even pork-bellies and orange juice.

Markets for trading commodities can be very efficient, particularly if the division into pools matches demand segments. These markets will quickly respond to changes in supply and demand to find an equilibrium price and quantity.

They are bought and sold on the "commodities market" just as stocks are traded on different stock markets. Contact a commodities broker to buy and sell commodities.</td>

<td>what is the difference between a mutual fund, a money market fund &amp; a total return fund in investing?</td>
<td>all of the above sound like they can fall under the mutual fund title.  A mutual fund typically invests in ten to hundreds to tens of hundreds of stock offering companies or different types of bonds or shorter term vehicles like corporate paper.  So, there many types of mutual funds stock funds, bond funds, stock with bond funds, municipal bond funds, government, bond funds, tax free money markets, regular money markets and others in-between.  The difference in the three you listed looks to deal directly with risk tolerance, time frame and goal.  A stock mutual fund generally should have a holding period of 5 years or more. A money market can be held for 2 minutes, days, year decades, it really does not matter a whole lot because it is very low risk and could be no risk if it is FDIC insured.  Finally the total return fund could be a bond fund which may or may not be tax free.  It assumes more risk and volatility than the money market but less than the stock fund.  Another idea to keep in mind is that there are different grades of bond funds (high, medium and low quality) and stock funds (large, mid and small cap) which invest in different size companies.

As most internet FX trading is all geared, most of the reputable FX dealers are associated or partnered with a back or investment bank that guarantees those "loans" in your leveraged trade.

They keep client money in a trust account, if you are profit and you close out your position, you get paid your profit and your capital returned. If you realise a loss, you pay out the loss out of your capital and more if you aren't protected.

Some brokers trade "naked" but I'd rather stay away from those kinds. That is without hedging their position in the market or by executing the position that their client takes in the market.</td>

Washington's unsustainable deficits 
Warren Buffet says to imagine it like a farmer would. "In order to consume 4% more than they produce -- that's the trade deficit -- we have, day by day, been both selling pieces of the farm and increasing the mortgage on what we still own." 

   Kids will get this message. The adults running Washington don't. Our trade deficit is unsustainable. Like the farmers, we borrow $700 billion a year to live high-on-the-hog. Washington's been cleverly hiding the game. Until the Dubai fiasco we didn't know that Washington's been fast selling America's equity assets to foreigners.
 
 Be sure to read Warren Buffet's other stories in the same article referenced in "Sources."  Unfortunately, our nation's moral character just keeps sinking deeper, while government debt explodes, Wall Street bonuses soar and Corporate America can't stop throwing money at greedy CEOs. 
 
  I trade stock index futures for a living. I'm not an economist or advisor or employed by a mutual fund or biased broker, and have to discern my own way to decisions. I do have investors though, and here is what I told them about the stock market.

   My technical analysis points to a top in the making. Fundamentally there are economic and business pressures mounting from the yield curve, energy prices, inflation, debt and housing. And lastly our historical research into the four-year Presidential Election Cycle indicates stocks are ripe for a fall and a major midterm bottom.

   Nine of the last fourteen bear market bottoms have come in the midterm year. Two occurred in post-election years, two in election years, and one in a pre-election year -- 1987, the biggest one-day crash of all time.

   The consumer accounts for two-thirds of the economy. U.S. household debt reached a record high $11.4 trillion. The increase in debt was the highest in 21 years. And U.S. households spent 13.75% of disposable income on servicing their debt -- another record high. Credit card delinquencies are at their third-highest level ever. Also, the savings rate of the consumer fell to its lowest since the Depression in 1933. 

   Unfortunately, the consumer can no longer rely on escalating real estate prices to financially bail them out.
43% of first-time homebuyers across the country bought properties with no-money down mortgages. Plus, what about all those adjustable-rate deals? There have been 14 consecutive interest rate hikes.
  
 These types of loans with rising rates place the consumers and the economy in an extremely vulnerable position. In actuality, the combination of those leveraged obligations and the increase in borrowing costs make the level of interest rates much higher than the quoted figure.
 
  You may have noticed that the bond yield curve has inverted. In the past, whenever the curve has inverted, for whatever the reason and at whatever level of interest rates, a recession has followed within months. This means that Ben Bernanke and his band of merry central bankers will have to keep raising the federal funds rate as long as the curve remains inverted.
 
  With economic growth slowing, crude still rising, and a choppy corporate profit outlook, perhaps the market appears to be getting a bit too volatile for those looking for a more steady return.

Especially if you own a significant amount of the company, it benefits you to have a 2-2 split because you can sell more shares but maintain your equity position.

Suppose a company has 100,000 shares of common stock and the majority owner holds 60% of those shares (60,000). If he sells 10,000 shares, he only owns 50% of the company; meaning he's probably in charge, but could be overruled.

* Are the shares liquid? Is there plenty of trading? If not, why not?

<td>Stock Price Charts?</td>
<td>Logarithmic charts are used for long-term charts.

Let's take the Dow Jones Industrial Average as an example. It's currently trading around 11000 or so.

If we have a look at the Dow back to say 1940 (the dow was at 150), the start of the chart looks like almost a flat line from 1940 to 1955.  The Dow actually rows to almost 500 in 1955.

The problem with a linear scale is that takes the maximum levels into account.  So a rise from 150 to 500 (a three folder increase) looks insignificant compared to the period between 1990 (dow was around 2700) to 1998 (when the dow got to over 9000, yet they are both dramatic movements.

So by using a log/semilog scale we can compare the relative price movements rather than the physical point changes.

So, a 3 fold increase looks the same whether the it's from 150 to 450 or 2700 to 8100.

WIRE SHORT 33.72 33.48 0.34 1.00% 

Stock Action Trigger Exit $ Results  % Results  
TOTAL 1.32 5.64% 

So they are accumulating the % profit or loss of each trade, in this case (march 30, 2006) they say they won 7 trades with a 1% so they accumulate a 7%, and because they lost 2 trades one of -1.29% and other of -0.07%, they deduct both trades from the 7% of the other 7 trades and claim a day result of 5.64%. Now, that can be misleading!!!

From their 9 day trades, 8 are type B trades, or daily "gap trades", those are conducted during the first one or two market hours once the matket opens, so i guess that kind of plays are likely to be conducted at the same time.

In this case, suppose you made all the 8 daily gap trades, investing, lets say, $10K on each trade, with the 6 winning type b trades, you would be making $100 dollars on each trade, that gives you $600 dollars, regarding the losers, you would lose $129 in one and $7 on the other, so $600 of wins less $136 of losers, gives u a result of $464, suppose that you also played another $10k in the type A trade that they say they won, that gives you another $100, so your day result would be $564.

According to this, we can have a more realistic average result for the day; if you conducted all 9 trades, you would be investing $90k during the day, from which $80k are likely to be managed at almost the same time because they are gap trades during the market oppening. Ok, so if you invested $90k for your day trades, the day´s win of $564, would represent a o.62% portfolio increase for the day, because $564 is the 0.62% of $90,000 dlls. 

0.64% !!!!!, that's far from the 5.64% they posted for the day!!!!.

I am not saying that the site is a scam, actually u would be winning a 0.64% in that day, which is not bad, what i am saying is that the numbres posted may be misleading for a person who doesnt do the math accordingly.

But take into account that they are posting march winnings of 43% just adding the dayly % posted on the site, but those daily % may not result as good as they seem according to what I just said, and also take into account that according to their daily results march 30 was among the biggest winning days during the month, in other days they add the % of the day trades for a 0.75% or 1.51% result, and that would give you earnings a lot less than a 0.64%.

I hope the numbers where better, i am also eager to become very rich, but day trading is not easy dude!!, and if you are thinking of quitting your job to become a day trader following any web site advise, just be careful, you may end up kicking your own butt.

Hope this was helpful!!</td>

<td>what is the intrinsic value of a stock?</td>
<td>In options terminology, the intrinsic value is the positive difference between the current price for the underlying and the strike price of an option. For a call option the strike price has to be under the price of the underlying; for a put option the strike price has to be over the price of the underlying. If an option has intrinsic value, it is also refered to as in-the-money, if it has no intrinsic value, it is refered to as out-of-the-money.

For example, if the strike price for a call option is USD 1 and the price of the underlying is USD 1.20, then the option has an intrinsic value of USD 0.20. Options are usually sold for their intrinsic value plus their time value. See option time value.

<td>When buying stocks I usually look at the current trade price and then  I divide it by the earnings per share a</td>
<td>Everyone has their own system and nothing works all the time.

I think you're wasting your time dividing the current price by the earnings per share because the result is called the price/earnings ratio and this number is generally given in any newspaper that lists stock prices, right along with the stock prices.  It's used by a lot of people as one way to evaluate the price of a stock.  This number tells how "cheap" or "expensive" the stock is but it doesn't tell WHY it's cheap or expensive.  Many people buy cheap stocks and wait for the price to go up but if there's a good reason as to why it's cheap and things get worse, you'll still lose money.

If the P/E ratio is high and it's too high compared to what the company is doing, the P/E ratio and the stock price could both go down.  The P/E ratio and the price of the stock can also go higher, though, if the company continues to do well or people think things will get even better.

There's nothing wrong with your logic, but just don't expect it to work all the time, or even a majority of the time.  I would suggest you look at the company and try to decide why the barometer you use is the way it is and evaluate other things about the company in addition to the number.  While nothing is fool-proof, a good guide that has good information on a lot of stocks is the Value Line Investment Survey which many libraries carry.  It's expensive to get on your own.  Standard and Poors also puts out binders with lots of stock evaluations that many libraries carry.  All I'm saying is the more info you consider beside just the numbers, the better your results will generally be.

Remember that anything unexpected can happen not only within the company but outside the company that can affect stock prices.  For instance when the airplanes flew into the world trade center buildings, most stocks took a big nose-dive that day and that had nothing to do with most individual companies.  Look at some graphs of company stock prices that day and the days after that tragedy and it'll take your breath away.

I once made some really good money on Goodyear because the stock price was hit really hard when another company in the same industy (B.F. Goodrich) had some really bad news.  A lot of people sold off their Goodyear stock and the price took a big dive.  I bought into it near the bottom.  When things got sorted out and people realized that Goodyear would not be affected, the share price recovered and I made some decent money in a relatively short period of time.  I'm not bragging. I've lost money too.  I'm just trying to say that the more you know as to why prices are the way they are, the better equipped you are to make money.

Reply to Additional Details:  I see what you say you're doing but you did say just the opposite in your original post, which was the P/E ratio.  I don't see anything wrong with what you're doing either way, but I still think you need to add more of the info I described above.  I went to a seminar a couple of weeks ago where they were pushing a computer analysis website where you can pick and choose stocks based on many different barometers, the combinations of which you choose.  Plus the software on the website analyzes all available stocks and makes its own recommendations, telling you which stocks are the strongest overall with a numerical rating scale.  The course teaching the system was $3000 for two days and the website after the course was $299 every six months.  It looked good, but there are many different computer programs that can help you if you want to strictly use technical analysis.  Again, my only problem is when you decide to buy stocks on only two or three parameters.  When you do that, it makes it harder to withstand adverse fluctuations when things go a little in the wrong direction.  If you buy a stock in hopes that it will go up and before it does, it go</td>

<td>Is there a website for young adults that explains in a simple, yet detailed way how to begin investing money?</td>
<td>beginnersinvest.about.com and earlyearners.com
Two websites you can check out. Best way to start investing is to just by setting aside a small about each week or month i.e. 25.00/week and letting it set in a savings account until you find a certain investment you would like. Whatever you do make sure that the investment is something you are comfortable with. And whatever anyone tells you nothing will guarantee a return except goverment obligations such as government issued bongs and banks. OTher than that there is risk. However risk isn't necessarily bad. Just research before you buy.</td>

<td>why does earning forcast more important than cash flow prediction?</td>
<td>There are probably many reasons but this may help you. Business transactions are usually recorded using either: 
A. cash based accounting which only recognises transactions upon receiving cash and 
B. accrual based accounting which recognises transactions when money is earned. 
For example, you sold a car and would receive the money in two weeks time. Under cash bases, you would recognise the sale only when the money is in your hands while under accrual bases, it is recognised as soon as you made the deal. 
Cash Flow predictions only represent the flow of cash and exclude profits made under accounts such as credit.
Earning forecast is made under an accrual bases and represents all the firms earnings in cash and on deferred accounts such as credit. This gives a more accurate and complete picture of all possible earnings as opposed to earnings only in the form of cash.</td>

<td>What is the best longterm investment advice for large amounts of money(millions)?</td>
<td>In this example you have $10,000,000.00

You invest $5,000,000.00 in the stock market with the help of a portfolio manager and you reinvest half of your profits and give away the rest to your family.
If you get a 10% return you reinvest $250,000.00 and you give away to your family $250,000.00 
If you get a 20% return you reinvest $500,000.00 and you give away to your family $500,000.00

This way you HAVE MORE MONEY EACH YEAR. Therefore you never run out of money.

Keep in mind that with a $5,000,000.00 portfolio you can afford a very expensive portfolio manager that hopefully will protect your money against bad investments and market crashes and war. Therefore there is a very low probability that you will lose money in a year.

Even if you lose, say 20% in the first year. You still have $4,000,000.00 to make more money in the future. (If that happens fire your portfolio manager)
When a bad year ends (Losses) you only give away to your family a minimum wage salary to survive that year or they could survive on credit for an entire year and when the next year comes they pay off all debts or a combination of both.

The other $5,000,000.00 goes to start a Company (You could easily start 50 $100,000.00 small businesses or 5 $1,000,000.00 medium size businesses)

Like before you reinvest half of the profits in the company and the rest goes to your family.

You hire 50 managers to run your small businesses or 5 manager to run your medium size businesses and you live your life.

The key is not to spend $5,000,000.00 to buy a house in Beverly Hills or $250,000.00 to buy a Ferrari because if you burn your money at that rate you will go broke within 3 years. Just like most Actors or Singers.

There is nothing wrong with a $250,000 Ferrari or a $5,000,000.00 House. 
Just buy them WITH YOUR PROFITS. (Take $125,000.00 from your company and $125,000.00 from your stock market profits and buy it)
If you did not make enough to buy it. You could save and buy it the next year.

It works like this: If you deposit $100 in the bank, the bank can then use that money to lend to someone else. If they lend it to someone else, that person then deposits that money into their bank account and then he or she also has $100. The bank can then take that money and loan it to someone else, and so on and so on and so on.

If you just kept your $100 in your matress, then only you would be able to use it. Putting it in the bank allows many others to use it. In a nutshell, that's how banks expand the money supply.</td>

The key is to have the dicipline to always live below your means and to consistantly save and invest.  It is no different to dieting or working out.  It doesn't matter what machines you work out on, you have to drop the Big Mac and get your butt off the couch and get to the gym.

My advice would be to find an amount of money that at the end of the month you will not miss.  Then find a good no load index or growth fund and set up a monthly, systematic investment.  The money will automatically come out of your bank account and you will never miss it.

(Anyone remember his saying DON'T BUY TOYOTA MOTORS last summer?  I bought it and have a 50% gain since then, as one example) With all investing, it takes thought on the part of the investor before they accept blindly what someone else says.  (I personally think Jim Cramer is an okay guy and watch his show on CNBC, have read his books, just don't always agree with him.)

I have found that if you have little money to start and want to get in quickly and hassal free - without filling in tons of forms - you can start up at Sharebuilder.com.  The site is limited but a great resource if you are just starting out.

<td>Im my opinion, the biggest aspect influencing the financial markets is globalization.  That is not to say that that is the only factor, you also have an increased demand for commodities, and a whole lot of geopolitical uncertanty.  To make things even more interesting, you have Al Qaida possing a huge unknown.  Higher energy prices are act as an unrecoverable and unbeneficial tax on the economy, but you can take advantage of that by positioning into the right types of investments that benefit from expensive energy, same with commodities to rebuild the world's aging infrastrure and emerging BRICK economies (BRICK stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China Korea in case you didnt' know that.  Globalization has to be the most powerful force affecting the financial markets right now though.  That is because through globalization, we have a virtual guarantee of cheap prices for many years to come. That is because globalization is a highly counterinflationary force becasuse it supplies plenty of cheap labor.  Right now, it is India and China, and when their standards of living rise causing their labor to get expensive, then cheap labor will shift to the next third world country... so you can really see how it is likely that in the future even Africa could become industrialized (and as a footnote, if you missed the movie Syriana which made an excellent point of this, places like the middle east will go nowhere because they refuse to get with the program and instead of developing their intelectual resources, they keep using up their natural resources to continue serving their political higherarchies IE, energy will eventually not come from there, then the'll be screwed.) But back to inflation and globalization.  Just look at the bond market if you don't believe me.  Yields on the long bond (30 year treasury) are lower than yields on the 2 year treasury.  That is the bond market saying: "there is no inflation" in the future.  Along with globalization comes the commoditazation of skills and knowledge.  That is what all the outsourcing of tech jobs is all about.  Same with manufacturing.  The internet and the 747 plane have allowed for pretty much everything to be commoditized through easy access to information, and an easy means for delivery of phisycal products.  Even the Financial Advisors job is being commoditized at a huge rate. Evidence is that now you can go to the Fidelity web site and buy bonds for a max of $500 mark up, no matter how large the principal ammount.  Also MSRB has made it mandatory to post principal profit within minutes from a trade posting.  Then, you have Ameritrade and its likes doing a trade for an unbeatable amount. So Globalization is upon us, and in the words of Darwin: "It is not the smartest, or the strongest who survive, it is the most adaptable who live..."</td>

most online brokers will let you buy pennies, they might restrict you from buying the ones that are highly volatile (scam like). if you have the cash in the account and are a customer with experience, they will do the trades. many pinks are companies that no longer wanted the expense of dealing with Sarbanes Oxley - SOX regulations as they became to expensive for small companies to comply with.

This is something that many novice investors overlook. You want to get 10% return on your investments but how do you want to get it with low or high risk.

3.  Investors are usually pretty unexcited to see structures where they invest in one vehicle and employees get the equity in another vehicle.  So if you have a parent and a sub, normally you want a 100% owned sub and all the individuals (investors, founders, employees) own a piece of the parent.</td>

<td>Is excessive portfolio turnover a common problem?  Is it a big enough problem that it needs to be corrected?</td>
<td>If your are an aggressive investor, you will find your self involved in mutual funds that have a high portfolio turnover and you will turn your own portfolio more quickly than average. Hence, high turnover is an expected feature, not a "problem"

However, if you are a conservative investor, then investing in funds with high turnover and/or making a lot of trades yourself doesn't make sense.

One thing turnover does is to spark taxable events. Thus, turnover is more of a problem in taxable accounts than in retirement accounts.

Basic guidelines: For long term investing in a tax-exempt retirement account, having a portfolio turnover of more than 25%/month is pretty aggressive . For conservative investors, a turnover of 25%/quarter is desirable.

Some will think these guidelines are high. I would refer them to Investors FastTrack for details.</td>

Now the US government will sell you a bond that pays inflation + 1%. They are called TIPS.  Of course the government makes you pay taxes on ALL the interest, not just the 1%. 

The other option that protects you from inflation is T-bills. Currently 6 mo T-bills pay about 4.7% which is more than 10 and 30 year bonds.</td>

If you are going to buy 2 or 3 stocks or more, I would recommend using a broker.  This will greatly simplify your life if you ever have to change the title on your accounts or if you need tax info, etc.  It is much easier to deal with one company.  You would also get all of your info on one statement instead of many.  These days the brokerage costs are low enough to make it worth your while.  Just a suggestion.

Sensex points are calculated by computing the market capitalization of these few compaines on each single day.

Small Cap means small capitalization stocks. Stocks which are small in terms of price and total number of shares. Example is a stock with a value of Rs. 15 and total number of shares is 1,00,00,000. so market cap would be 15,00,00,000

Medium Cap means medium capitalization stocks. Stocks which are not very small nor very big in terms of price and total number of share. Example is a stock with a value of Rs 85 and the total number of shares is 1,00,00,000. So market cap would be 85,00,00,000</td>

A person may consider a pet sitting business to be the most exciting work in the world, while another person would rather watch TV than take care of dogs. 

The key is to determine what your interests are, what you want to do, what is suitable for your lifestyle and your overall goals, and what can fit with your resources.

Dan Ramsey in his book "101 Best Home Businesses" has a chapter on how to find YOUR best home business. He suggests these 10 steps:

1. List 5 things you do best
2. List how others would benefit from what you do best
3. Find out how to give people what they want
4. Learn the value of your services to others
5. Find out who else offers similar services
6. Learn from the successes of others
7. Learn from the failures of others
8. Plan your own success
9. Make low cost mistakes
10. Enjoy what you do and how you do it

He then made suggestions on the best home businesses according to type. Here are a few of them:

Best Businesses Using Craft or Physical Skills
- antique restoration
- auto detail service
- carpet cleaning business
- errand/delivery service
- housecleaning business

Best Service Businesses

<td>How to get cash out of buying real estate?</td>
<td>there are multiple answers to your question so I'll give a few examples, some take time, and other's take more money, you can choose what is best for you.

1. one way is to just buy a house to live in and hope it appreciates in value. Over the past 5 years appreciation on real estate has gone through the roof. That trend is slowing down though, so probably isn't the best solution. (However, owning your own home has very nice tax benefits when filing for your tax return, so owning your own home is a very good idea anyway).

2. Rental property. Find a multi-family home, which is generally a regular to oversized house with multiple apartment units in it (about 2 to 4 units). This is an excellent revenue generator, but also comes with some headaches of dealing with tennants. If you don't mind investing in lower income areas, buying a home in a lower income area and accepting section 8 residents (residents using section 8 government help have their rent checks go directly from the government to the landlord), can take a lot of stress out of being a landlord considering you never have to haggle over rent.  The other issue with that is maintaining the property. It helps to be handy to keep maintenance costs low, therefore increasing your profit.

The other good thing about that is that lower income areas generally tend to go through a revival at some point where the govt looks to renovate an area, by putting a civic use building in the area or just injecting the area with some money (such as a sports stadium or office buildings). When this happens the value of the properties surrounding it go up, which would build equity in your place. 

3. Flip a house. Flipping is the biggest risk/reward situation. You never know what you are getting when you buy a house at auction, but then again, you are getting a piece of property that will turn a big profit when you are done if the project is done right. Since you can't get in the property or do a thorough search of the structure, you don't know what lies in the walls and under the floors. You could have some serious damage in the house, which is a nightmare to fix. The biggest prizes are houses that just need cosmetics done such as new floors, bathrooms, kitchens, some nice paint and some landscaping. These can all be done relatively inexpensively (compared to structural work), and can turn a hefty profit.

Each scenario is different and you have to do what works for you. None are easy and they all take patience. The easiest one to do is to buy a multi-family house and live in it for a year while you rent out the other units (a mortgage for a primary residence is the easiest to get and less of a hassle). After a year or so, move out and rent the unit you lived in, and take the money you made/saved in that period of time and put it into another house.</td>

<td>Explain in plain eglish(street talk) the theory on annuities or where one can get fundemental briefing on same</td>
<td>An annuity is essentially a level stream of cash flows for a fixed period of time. It is most often used as a guaranteed income stream during retirement.

Most annuities are tax sheltering, meaning that your contributions to the annuity decrease your taxable earnings for the current year!

There are primarily 2 types of annuities used by investors:
1)  Immediate annuities - you contribute a lump sum of money into the annuity and immediately begin receiving level payments from the annuity.
PROS:  If you just won the lotto or received a huge settlement from a lawsuit, this is a good option.  You can deposit all of that money into an annuity and avoid having to pay 50% or more in taxes that year.  Instead, you would set it up to receive stead payouts from it over several years.  You would realize the taxable income only when you get the payouts, helping you stay in a reasonable tax-bracket.
CONS:  Many people don't receive a lump sum; and even if they did, many people need the money immediately.

2) Deffered annuities - contribute money into an annuity over a period of time, usually during your working life, and then receive steady payments after this period, usually when you retire.
PROS:  You have time on your side to accumulate the money and to earn interest on the money.  The money contributed to annuities is guaranteed, unlike with stocks or some other investments.
CONS:  Once it's in there, you can't take it out with out penalties until you retire, except for specifically defined emergencies.  These penalties are in addition to whatever applicable income tax you have to pay and could bump you to a new tax bracket if the pre-retirement take-out is large enough.

http://www.bankrate.com/brm/rate/depRsearch_product.asp?params=NY,251,0

The link above is already set for Long Island NY area.  From there, you'll need to choose the length of time for the CD and if it is a jumbo CD or not.  Then you'll get a listing of the institutions and their rates.  For example, a one year CD pays (sorted by rate):
FirstFedDirect - 4.93%
Countrywide Bank - 4.88%
Washington Mutual Bank - 4.51%
...

The data that bankrate provides includes internet banks.  That's where I learned about EmigrantDirect's savings account, currently paying 4.5% APY.  I use this account to earn interest on money that I will need in the short term.

Hope that helps.</td>

<td>I want to invest in sirius, how do I go about it? I've never invested before?</td>
<td>I would not contact a broker like AG Edwards or one of those. Their commissions are unholy. You obviously have access to the internet so an internet broker is your best bet. Their commissions are much much less. And there are several.  You can normally set up an account on line but occassionally you have to make a phone call and have them send you some forms to fill out. 

Sharebuilder.com is a good choice as are several others.  
Here is the bad part.  There is a 3 day settlment period. It used to be 5 but the SEC reduced it to 3 several years ago despite the fact that mail service is so slow now that it is impossible to get a check to your broker within the 3 day period. You can execute a bank wire transfer for which your bank will probably charge you $35. Banks do like to make lots of money every chance they get. 

Also most online brokers will make you deposit funds in your account before they will execute any transactions for you normally $500 to $1000.  However, in my opinion it is best to deposit the full amount of your projected purchase before hand unless you set up a margin account. In that case only 50% of the purchase price will be required. The broker will charge you interest monthly on the money they lend you to cover the remainder of the cost. And if the price of Sirius falls, you will be asked to put up more margin.  

Go for it. But, I personally think Sirius is very speculative. But then again I have lost money on speculative investments too.</td>

<td>How do u get the face value for a Private Security? Is there more than 1 way to get that value please explain?</td>
<td>This is a very vague question so I'll do my best to answer.

Let's use a stock first as an example.

If by private security you mean the stock of a non-public company then there is no way to directly get the value.  In fact, until someone actually does some sort of valuation the actual amount is really unknown.  It's more complicated then this even but for the sake of keeping things simplistic there is no way to get "the official" value of the stock of a private company.  Now you can estimate it based on comparable companies, etc. and this might get you somewhere in the ballpark.

Now let's say you are using debt as the example of a private security.  Some companies that are non-public do issue debt securities.  In fact, there are many junk-bond rated companies thare are non-public.  Most of the time the face value of the debt is par (100) and in your case I would just assume that this is the case because it is true just about all the time.</td>

<td>what is mutual funds and how does it work?</td>
<td>Since every individual cannot become expert for trading in stock market and making large money due to lack of time and expertise.Due to this limitation the concept of Mutual Fund (MF) has come into picture.

MF is a trust created by a trustee. For eg. In india Reliance Mutual fund is created by Reliance Capital who is a trustee. That MF collects funds from retail individuals and invest in the market. For doing this MF hires Fund Managers called FMC. They are group of experts who form a company and render services to any individual MF. They will be paid for their services. And when the retail investor request for redemption of funds. The MF sells the shares to that extent and return the money to the individual. The valuation is based on NAV (Net Asset Value). This figure is calculated everyday on the basis of the value of whole portfolio at the end of everyday. So the day when you invest the money will be converted to units (not shares) at that day's NAV and then when you sell those units will be muntiplied by the NAV on selling day and gives you money back.

Gold is rising because of a number of factors, primarily, because of the budget and trade deficit that the US is experiencing. global inflation is also another factor. raw material prices have increased significantly over the past few years. also international tensions from time to time have given impetus for gold price to rise. but most of all, gold will rise because our confidence in fiat money, the money you hold in your hands, is eroding. think about it, how much would your $10 buy now as compared to 5-10 years ago. significantly much less i would think, unless youre a spendthrift. a dollar 20 years ago is a lot more than it is now. gold is the way to go, invest in real money, this is it.</td>

So when it all came up all those little decreases looked like one big one. The liability is that you have to report a loss even if you don't sell and it comes back up later.

As for a margin account the same sort of thing applies. You may have to put more money in the account to satisfy a margin call if the value has dropped. It is calculated each day. The liability is that maybe you weren't counting on having to put that money in and have to sell off the stock at its lowest value if you can't come up with the funds (and it indeed does recover).</td>

<td>How can an individual investor become involved in an IPO. Please describe in detail...?</td>
<td>By becoming involved, I asssume you mean buying the shares of the IPO. If you want to be involved in the listing processs, you either have to be a banker, accountant or lawyer. 

Here is the process in detail:

1) Company makes application to the stock exchange for listing;
2) Company prepares all documentation to fulfill stock exchange requirements;
3) once all the documentation is done, stock exchange gives formal approval for listing;
4) Banks underwrite the IPO process - meaning that if the shares fail to sell at the listed price, the bank will have to buy it themselves (therefore the bank makes its book first - presells to good existing customers);
5) To do the above, bank brings the company on a road show to meet investors; 
6) Certain stakes may also be sold to strategic investors, others sold cheap to friends and family;
7) the company usually asks for a certain amount of shares to be in the public hands. Thus, you can get the prospectus and make an application.
8) If it is oversubscribed, the bank ususally allots the shares; and finally
9) listing day.

Hope this helps</td>

<td>It depends on 2 conditions: (1) the tax rate now and the tax rate in the future, and (2) what can you invest in your 401K plan. 

Tax-wise, you first need to understand the following: (1) 401K and traditional deductible IRA are tax deductible and tax deferred.  (2) RothIRA is not tax deductible, but the income is tax free. (3) Traditional nondeductible IRA is tax deferred.  (Note that there are 3 kinds of IRAs account---traditional deductible IRA, traditional nondeductible IRA, and RothIRA.) Therefore, the best one for you depends on your current tax rate and your future tax rate, but in general 401K and traditional IRA are very good. 

Investment-wise, 401K often has limited choice of investment. If your choice is so limited that you can make enough compound growth, then it may not be good for you. 

Bottom-line: you still need to do a little research to decide which one is better.</td>

<td>What is the difference between Annualised and Absolute Returns?</td>
<td>Return is what you get (or expect to get) divided by what you invested.
Annualised Return is, given a Return over a period of time (say L), how much would you get over a year period.
For SIMPLE (or not compound) interest, you have
R= 360 / L x r, where
R is annualised return,
r is EFFECTIVE return (that is, what you EFFECTIVELY get)
and L is the investment period.

It's a simple (and archaic, let's say) way to compare yields for different investment periods.

ABSOLUTE RETURN is opposed to RELATIVE RETURN.
That is, absolute return is how much do you get, while relative return is how much you over a given benchmark, or comparison measure.
Absolute return, as weel as Relative Return, can be expressed in both annualised or effective terms.

Options:  These are contracts that you buy which, if they meet a certain criteria, allow you to purchase shares at a set price at a set time.  For instance, a contract to buy 100 google shares at $225 on April 1st.  YOu might pay $70 for this contract (at least).

On April 1st, you have to buy the google shares.  If they are worth more than the $70 price in your contract, you gain 100 shares times the difference.  BUT&gt;...  if they are worth less, you have lost the difference.

I recommend you check out www.motleyfool.com or other investing sites.  When in doubt, check with a professional.

<td>Can anyone recommend a forex system that the use and trade?</td>
<td>No.

The reason is simple: No serious vendor would offer Forex Trading Systems.

Here's why:

Though they call it the "Foreign Exchange" there is no exchange. Prices are NOT regulated or standardized as they are in the futures markets. In fact, when trading Forex you are trading against the broker and not against other traders.That's why they can "guarantee fills".

You are trading against the house, and the broker takes the other side of the trade. Keep in mind that you receive the forex quotes from your broker, and he can basically display any price.

Take a look at the following Forex quotes. All three screenshots were takes on Tuesday, March 21st at 3:30pm US Central Time.
I used three different websites to obtain the quotes:
** (I can't post graphics here. Please visit http://rockwelltrading.helpserve.com/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=42&amp;nav=0  to see the graphics).**

Take a look at today's high of the USD/EUR currency pair:

    * The first data source reports it at 1.2164.
    * The second dat source shows 1.21595 and
    * The third data source reports a high of 1.2166

That's a difference of 6.5 ticks (= $65!!!).

As you know, all indicators and trading rules are based on the following five data:

    * Open,
    * High,
    * Low,
    * Close
    * Volume

There is no volume information available when trading Forex, so you're already limited when creating a trading system.
And then there's the difference between the data sources, which causes the following problems:

    * False Signals
      If your trading system is based on the high of the previous day, you would have to enter the market tomorrow at
      .... uhm.... 1.2164? ..... or 1.21595? ..... or 1.2166? ..... or maybe something completely different?
    * False Fills
      Let's say your trading system gave you a signal to enter the market today at 1.2160.
      If you'd be using broker No.2 you would have been filled, but what about Broker 1 and 3?
      Probably no fill there.

Do you see the problem?

How can a serious vendor offer a trading system, if you get false signals and false fills?</td>

<td>What is a reasonable fee for a financial advisor?</td>
<td>Unless you are quite wealthy and in need of extensive estate planning you should never have to pay $5,000 for a plan. That is just ridiculous. For a comprehensive plan with only basic estate planning you will be in the $1,000 -$2,500 range. I don't mean to pick on the Senor, but never take advice from someone who: 
A) Tells you what to do without asking about your financial situation, goals, concerns and outlook EXTENSIVELY FIRST.
B) Tells you only to consider buying term life insurance.
C) Uses a multiple of salary approach to determining your need for coverage.

Seek out a financial planner in your area. try the Planner Search feature on the Financial Planning Association's website: www.fpanet.org

When interviewing planners ask alot of questions. How do you get paid? What is your investment philosophy? If I came to you 5 years ago would your advice to me then be different than what it is now? Do you have any clients that would be willing to talk to me about your services?

A planner that has trouble answering these questions should be given more scrutiny. Good Luck.</td>

What your're buying when purchase a mutual fund is professional management to make decisions for you in the stock market.  You should handle a mutual fund differently from the way you handle individual stocks. A stock may decline and never come back in price.  A well selected, diversified domestic growth-stock fund run by a established management organization will, in time, always recover from the steep corrections that naturally occur during a bear markets.

Many companies pay dividends to their shareholders. If you look at a detailed stock quote (see the link below), you'll usually see a 'dividend yield' figure (under the Valuation header on this page). In this case, HPT's dividend yield is 6.3% (meaning that over the course of the past year, they have paid dividends that equal 6.3% of their share price).

These dividends can be paid out to you to provide regular income (I own HPT through Sharebuilder, and have my dividends automatically reinvested).</td>

<td>Is buying a land or other investments are better than bank interest especially in long term? Mention a site?</td>
<td>Usually buying land, property etc is a good long term investement, sometimes even in the short term it can prove worthwhile.

The thing about land and property is that there's no guarantee it's value will rise - in most cases it does but not always.

By investing in a bank you know your money's going to be safe and in the worst case scenario you're guaranteed to get you money back plus at least some interest.

Historically land and property has been a good investment, expecially over the long term.  There are times when values drop and localized factors can cause price falls (e.g. building a new highway, factory etc nearby).

Land and property is more complicated and it takes longer to get your money invested and also when you want to cash-in your investement it takes longer to get your money out, with a bank there's none of the waiting.  There's also none of the fees that you'd have to pay for buying and selling land or property.

Most of my money is tied up in property and it'not caused me any sleepless nights.  My personal recommendation is to go for land &amp; property but do so through a reputable agent.</td>

<td>In all seriousness, why is gold considered so valuabale?</td>
<td>Gold started out as valuable in ancient days because it made durable, pretty looking jewelry.  Because it was rare, kings and rich people used gold jewelry, etc as a status symbol.  People then found it made a good money for expensive purchases. You can easily carry gold coins around, and the cost is easily calculated by weight.  Once it became money, even more people wanted it, pushing its value up even more.  

Now that we are off the gold standard, gold still holds its allure as a rare substance, due to its history.  Also, gold has a clear value per ounce and is easily exchangeable.  When you buy many other rare things like diamonds, its hard to know exactly what they're worth.  You have to be an expert in the field to evaluate them.

However, over the long run, gold is a very volatile investment, and there's no guarantee it will go up in the future.  It is now selling for less than it was in 1980.</td>

<td>D-shares M-shares meaning??</td>
<td>C-shares are more easily remembered as level-load funds. These shares often carry a very small front-end load, or, sometimes, no load at all. You make up for the lower load, however, with higher ongoing expenses, mostly through the fund's 12b-1 fee. The 12b-1 fee is an "advertising" fee that fund companies sometimes attach to a fund's expenses. The fee will be discussed in more detail in another session. Although lower front-end costs are nice, the higher ongoing expenses can diminish your return over the long haul. 

D-Shares can be anything a fund company wants. Most often, though, they represent back-end loaded shares that have a different price or expense structure than B-shares. The difference could be in the 12b-1 fee, or in the number of years the fund must be held before the fee reverts to zero. 

I- and Y-shares are usually institutional or high net worth share classes. In short, to get in to these share classes you need a lot of money. Often the minimum investment for these shares is in the million-dollar range. While some I- or Y-share classes may have size requirements as low as $100,000, you are still talking about big bucks. Because of the size of the initial investment, these shares usually don't carry sales loads, and, sometimes, the ongoing management fee is lower than for other share classes. Smaller investors might find these funds offered through a work sponsored retirement plan. If this is the case, individuals are not expected to come up with the minimum investment. It is assumed by the fund company that all of the employees combined will invest enough money to meet any minimum investment requirements that are in place. 

M-shares are the great "catch all." There is no standard for these shares, and fund companies use them for a myriad of purposes. Some have front-end loads, some have back-end loads, and some are level-loaded funds. Make sure you examine this option closely before jumping in, if a fund company offers this share class, there is something different about it. 

Lastly, there are Z-shares. This share class is usually used to signify shares in a fund that started off as a no-load offering, but that later changed to a load fund. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as a fund merger. Usually these shares are not available to new investors. If your shares have been converted to Z-shares, however, don't worry; it shouldn't change anything about your load structure. 

One more class of shares you should be aware of is the advisor class. Very often, no-load fund families decide to start offering loaded versions of their funds. This is done to increase the distribution channels through which their funds are offered. This share class generally has 12b-1 fees attached to pay financial advisors who put their clients' money into these funds.</td>

You may want to start with an S&amp;P500 index fund (low cost) like Vanguard or Fidelity. If you move to managed funds (over time) learn about other no-loads/low expense mutual fund companies. Also check out ETF's.

Decent fund companies include;
Vanguard, Fidelity, Dodge &amp; Cox, Aerial, Artisian, Oakmark and many others. After 35 years of investing I'm 50% in stocks &amp; 50% in ETF's for the stock side of my Asset Allocation.</td>

<td>Should I buy U.S stocks or others'? And what're bull vs bear market prospects?</td>
<td>Good question. First off, depending on who you talk with, US stocks have had a fairly strong bull run from late 2002. There are several schools of thought as to the current market trend. My view is that leading US stocks that drove this rally (GOOG, EBAY, YHOO, APPL, etc.) are being distributed, if this continues, the general market is probably going lower. Could change at any time.

The US and western Europe have the best developed, most liquid equity markets. Other markets have excellent potential, however there is more risk as well. For the most part, financial statements released by US companies are reliable. Other countires may not be as rigorous. There may be other risks in less developed markets as well.

There are so many different ways to invest in stocks, it's very hard to determine if you should start now.

You need to learn about the market and develop the skills to decide what is best for you.

Warren Buffett and William O'Neil are examples of people very successful investing in stocks. They share some similar views, but are very different investors. Search them on Yahoo! O'Neil's book "How to Make Money in Stocks," is excellent.

Taking a position in a stock or market takes research, planning and courage. Mutual funds, ETFs and hedge funds are excellent alternatives.</td>

<td>diffrence between futures and option in stock market?</td>
<td>Future: A standardized, transferable, exchange-traded contract that requires delivery of a commodity, bond, currency, or stock index, at a specified price, on a specified future date. Unlike options, futures convey an obligation to buy. The risk to the holder is unlimited, and because the payoff pattern is symmetrical, the risk to the seller is unlimited as well. Dollars lost and gained by each party on a futures contract are equal and opposite. In other words, futures trading is a zero-sum game. Futures contracts are forward contracts, meaning they represent a pledge to make a certain transaction at a future date. The exchange of assets occurs on the date specified in the contract. Futures are distinguished from generic forward contracts in that they contain standardized terms, trade on a formal exchange, are regulated by overseeing agencies, and are guaranteed by clearinghouses. Also, in order to insure that payment will occur, futures have a margin requirement that must be settled daily. Finally, by making an offsetting trade, taking delivery of goods, or arranging for an exchange of goods, futures contracts can be closed. Hedgers often trade futures for the purpose of keeping price risk in check. also called futures contract. 

Option: The right, but not the obligation, to buy (for a call option) or sell (for a put option) a specific amount of a given stock, commodity, currency, index, or debt, at a specified price (the strike price) during a specified period of time. For stock options, the amount is usually 100 shares. Each option has a buyer, called the holder, and a seller, known as the writer. If the option contract is exercised, the writer is responsible for fulfilling the terms of the contract by delivering the shares to the appropriate party. In the case of a security that cannot be delivered such as an index, the contract is settled in cash. For the holder, the potential loss is limited to the price paid to acquire the option. When an option is not exercised, it expires. No shares change hands and the money spent to purchase the option is lost. For the buyer, the upside is unlimited. Options, like stocks, are therefore said to have an asymmetrical payoff pattern. For the writer, the potential loss is unlimited unless the contract is covered, meaning that the writer already owns the security underlying the option. Options are most frequently as either leverage or protection. As leverage, options allow the holder to control equity in a limited capacity for a fraction of what the shares would cost. The difference can be invested elsewhere until the option is exercised. As protection, options can guard against price fluctuations in the near term because they provide the right acquire the underlying stock at a fixed price for a limited time. risk is limited to the option premium (except when writing options for a security that is not already owned). However, the costs of trading options (including both commissions and the bid/ask spread) is higher on a percentage basis than trading the underlying stock. In addition, options are very complex and require a great deal of observation and maintenance. also called option contract.</td>

A short seller borrows shares from a broker, sells them and buys the sares back at hopefully a lower price and gives the shares back to the broker.  If the seller and broker are working together there is no need to buy backed shares because there were no shares to borrow.  If the broker was acting alone, he could give the short seller stocks that don't exist, the short seller sells them and buys back real shares to the broker.

The money that they make is added to the value of your fund, but you have to lock it in for a minimum amount of time; can be as long as ten years. This is a good place to start out. If your feeling more daring invest in silver or mining companies like Pan American Silver trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker PAA.

<td>Please explain to me about stock exchange process.How can I game on the stock exch.?Please give accurate info?</td>
<td>As far as I know, you buy the stock at a certain price. Example, you buy a share of yahoo stock for about $30. You watch as the price of the stock goes up and down. Let's say that the next day, yahoo's stock price goes up to $31. Then, if you only bought one stock, you would GAIN $1 (if you sold it then, but let's pretend u didnt). To get your total gain, you would multiply the change in the stock price and the number of shares you bought. So if you bought 10 shares of yahoo stock, and the price went up $1, you would have gained $10.
Now, for the LOST. Let's say that the stock price for yahoo stock went down the next day to $29. That means you LOST $1, NOT $2, because you bought the stock for $30. So $29 - $ 30 is -$1. (The negative means you lost money) 

SO overall, to get your change in stock price, you subtract the stock price of that day to the stock price in which you bought it from. (E.g. $29 - $30 in my above example) And if you bought more than one share, which is what happens 99% of the time, then you multiply the change in stock price and the number of shares you have. Negative means you LOST money, and positive means you GAINED money.

<td>How is the price of a share determined?</td>
<td>Well in the market there are dealers, at least two of them trading every stock. Blue chip stocks like Microsoft (MSFT) have lots of dealers like in the area of 50 I believe. Well each dealer has a price they want to buy and sell at. The price at which a dealer buys is the bid price, and the price at which the dealer sells is the ask price. Dealers buy and sell shares from investors. Example if I was buying 100 hsare ABC and you were selling 100 at the same time as me, the share would not go from you to me a dealer would buy your shares and sell me my shares, it could be the same dealer or not. Oh, and the dealers offering the best prices make the BID and ASK price so the investor is always selling or buying and the current best offer(because not all dealers choose to buy or sell at the same price, the highest price that even one dealer is willing to buy at becomes the bid price and the lowest price that even one dealer is willing to sell at is the ask price).

In your example above $20 would be the price of the stock, weather it would hold or not dpends on the willingness of other to also pay that much.  

Let's see how I can explain this.

Ok, the dealers are not interested in the stock price going up or down, they just want high volume, because they generally make the diffrence between the ask and bid price. So they move the stock to a range where lots of buying and selling occur, they must have both buying and selling, or they might buy a buch of shares then have to lower the price so that they can sell, in which case they may buy, then sell for less. So they pick the range that has lots of both so they can buy at say 10.01 and sell at 10.03 it's only 2 cents but it's practically guaranteed and 2 cents on say 1 million shares is still $20,000. 

Example
If lots of buying (dealers selling)is going on generally they raise the price continually untill selling (dealer buying) starts or they would loose out on additional profits by holding the price constant, and they could also empty their share inventory by not raising the price untill people are willing to sell share to them and the bid price.  

With so many people on both sides of a stock all the dealers on one end and all the investors on the other both pushing the stock price in oposite directions the stock price is then always at the equalibrium of those two.</td>

<td>General Question About Getting Started with investing?</td>
<td>$300 - $500???  Good returns????

What a waste of time and effort!

Where you park that amount of money doesn't matter a hill o' beans.  Even 0% return is fine.

You should be concentrating on adding to that nest egg and getting it to a sizable amount before talking stocks or mutual funds.  When I say "sizable, I'm talking $5k - $10k at the very least.

If you invest that money and you aren't charged any fees at all (not likely) and you make a super-duper 20% return on $500 the first year, you've made a measly $100.  How long would it take you to find $100 to add to that nest egg just by working at Taco Bell?  A couple of days?

Put that money wherever you want and concentrate on building it up before you start talking investing.  Otherwise the hard work over such small amounts of money in return will burn you out.

If you really want to invest that money wisely, buy some books on investing or on your education in some field that really gets your blood flowing that will enable you to make serious money by making yourself more valuable either to an employer or out in the business world.

Then you'll really see a super duper exponential return on your money if you do it right.  The first book you might consider buying with that money is a book by Warren Farrell entitled "Why Men Earn More".  It was written primarily for women but it will be no less helpful to you as a guy.  It'll teach you where the money's at.

Number two on the list you should consider would be, "The Richest Man in Babylon" by George S. Clason.  Then if you'd really like to get serious about making some really serious money, number three should be, "Mentored by a Millionaire" by Steven K. Scott.  Number four could be, "The Millionaire's Secrets" by Mark Fisher.

Good luck!  Invest in yourself!</td>

At 48 cents a share, i believe you cant go wrong. but expect to hold for up to 3 years or so, depending on the growth, it may take a while, you never know. i have bought at as low a i think 41 cents, and i sell if it surges to 75 cents or more. but i never suggest day trading. i think it would be a wise buy and hold stock.

You could cope better in a number of ways. 

You could buy shares of oil exploration/drilling/refining companies that would likely enjoy higher profits as gas prices increase.

You could live close to town and to work so that you could rely on automobile usage less. The less you drive, the less the price of gasoline will directly affect you. Hybrids are promising technology, but the cost differential between regular and hybrid cars is large enough to make them uneconomical for many people. This will change over time though.

Personally, I drive very little, so the price of gasoline is a miniscule portion of my income. It would not affect me too much.

Gasoline, after correcting for the loss of value of the dollar is still significanly cheaper than it has been at many points in time, including the 1970's. People survived then, they will survive with gasoline that costs three times what it does now.

Driving for pleasure may decrease, so if your income is dependent on tourist traffic, I would consider the possiblity of checking out another field if you are concerned.</td>

There is also such a thing as a reverse split.  These really hurt.  You may have 100 shares at $75.00 and they might do a 1 to 1000 split and all of a sudden you own 1/10th share valued at $75,000.  These usually lose value very fast and before you know it, you have 1/10 share valued at $75.00. A company can split stocks as often as they like as long as they comply with their corporate bylaws.</td>

<td>what is float revenue?</td>
<td>Float revenue is the interest earned on deposits between the time a payment is debited and the time it takes to credit the payment to the recipient. During this time, the money sits in an interest bearing account earning "float revenue".

As an example, when you use online bill payment, your bank deducts funds from your account on Day 1 and deposits it in their own interest earning account on Day 2. 

The party receiving the payment receives and deposits the payment on Day 3 and it clears on Day 4. You've been out your money from Day 1. The service provider receives interest "float revenue" for holding your funds from Day 2-3 - sometimes longer.</td>

<td>The first thing is to buy your own home you plan to live in. Once you do that, buy either a condo/townhouse or a single-family home. Buy something in a good area, where jobs are being created, desirable, good schools, near public transport, near shops, etc.. 

If buying a property to rent out, ask your Realtor/mortgage broker to "run the numbers" to determine how much cash flow you will have. To decide on which property to purchase, look at their cash flows and compare them against each other. If the cash flow is negative, based on what you can afford, decide how much you are willing to pay out of pocket each month to keep the property. Research and figure out if the projected apprecation is what you are really looking for. in that case, you may decide that paying monthly to keep the property is worth the investment.

This should be your main focus. 

You can worry about the next step after what I said above.

Buy a fixer upper only if you already have a team of contractors in place and the housing market environment in your area shows that it's possible to make money fixing this up. Also, only deal with fixer uppers if you are a handy (wo)man yourself.</td>

now companies use it to lock in other prices like oil, pladium, copper, tin, gasoline, interest rates, pretty much anything that you use a lot of you can set your price with a contract as long as it is traded.
the real thing that pushes this market is speculators who are willing to accept the other side of the contract, the sell to the buy, they are willing to take the risk that the other party is trying to offset. so to answer the question finally.
hedge funds mitigate risk by offsetting price fluctuations but only work with another party willing to take that risk on. the effect on the economy is a stabilizing effect where highs and lows are clipped for large companies making it easier to forecast and project growth and make it easier for companies to move forward with less risk to the bottom line. this also spreads the risk around so that if there is a shock to a commodity the risk that is faced by a company is lessened by the hedge fund. and the economy will not rise to fast as a hedge fund will also stop large profits from being realized. hope that helps.</td>

<td>how to calculate risks for investments?</td>
<td>Risk might be equated to uncertainty: uncertainty about achieving your investing goals. Usually, proffesional aproximmate uncertainty with standard deviation.
basically that's all behind risk perception.
Now, covariance is a measure about how returns on one assets might be relate to ohters'. In order to calculate the standard deviation of a portolio , you need a covariance matrix:
se = sqrt( X'CX) where se is standard deviation of the return, sqrt stands for square root, X is a vector of portfolio holdings and C is a covariance matrix.
Beta is the regression coefficient of one asset's returns with respect to the market returns. It an easy and dirty way to approximate the std deviation of given asset. However, its not much more difficult to express assets returns as a linear function of several factors. That is called multivariate analysis or, in financial jargon, APT (arbitrage pricing theory). 
If the returns are expressed as linear combinations of factors and F is factor weighting matrix (entries being securities and factors), C can be calculated as 
C=F'M f where M is the factor covariance matrix.

now, we have been talking about absolute risk. What is relevant, however is risk relative to goal (benchmark) for doing that you have to measure tracking error, which is de std dev of the differences in return between the benchmark and the portfolio.
Systematic risk is the risk that can be avoided by diversifiing de portfolio. Unsystematic risk is the risk that is inherent to the underlying market</td>

If you're dead set on FX, you could probably also see lower costs of entry from those middlemen brokers, but those are usually just bucket shops who will kill you on spreads and you probably don't want to go there.</td>

Q. What is a credit score, and how does it affect my ability to get credit?
A: Credit scoring is a system creditors use to help determine whether to give you credit, and how much to charge you for it.

Information about you and your credit experiences, like your bill-paying history, the number and type of accounts you have, late payments, collection actions, outstanding debt, and the age of your accounts, is collected from your credit application and your credit report. Using a statistical formula, creditors compare this information to the credit performance of consumers with similar profiles. A credit scoring system awards points for each factor. A total number of points — a credit score — helps predict how creditworthy you are, that is, how likely it is that you will repay a loan and make the payments on time. Generally, consumers with good credit risks have higher credit scores.</td>

<td>wat are the diffrent ways to save money?</td>
<td>Start investing in the stock market.  I have listed below a link to a really interesting article that can say it much better then I can.  It is a great way to start out with little or no money and not pay big commissions to brokers.

I used this program and have done really well over the last two years.  Started with little money, added little money and learned discipline and a lot about the stock market.  I now teach others to do the same.  

Don't have that $100 bucks to get started?  I bet you do if you just change the way you spend money.  Will include a link to the online broker that I used to start my savings.  I also went ahead and opened a credit card through the Sharebuilder website.  The credit card has a 0% APR on opening transfers and pays you 1% cash back that you can use to purchase Stocks with in your Sharebuilder plan.  If you pay your balance every month (which is the only way that you should use credit), then this is FREE money. 

If you have a Bank of America Checking account they have started a plan that is called "Keep the Change."  With this plan, once you have opened a savings account with $100, they round up all your purchases.  If you buy something for $1.25 with your debit card, they will withdrawal $.75 (rounded up to $2.00) from your checking account and deposit it into your savings account.  After the first three months of doing this, they then will match your money dollar for dollar, 100%.  Then after the first year, they will match your round ups at a 5% rate.  The account only pays .5% APR, but the 100% matching for the first three months is FREE money. 

That is a 100% return on your deposits (round ups) for the first three months.  

If you don't have a BOA account then try looking online for a good paying Money Market Fund (MMF).  Some have balance requirements, some don't.  The better rates out there as of today are running about 4.25% or higher.  Watch for fees, compounding methods and other charges before you consider purchasing a MMF.  

Good luck and start saving today!  

Too many Americans don't save enough money.  Instead, they look for the lowest payment on that purchase.  You should ask yourself, do I want to pay myself first (saving money) and purchase something for cash or retire with style or do I want to always be in debt paying others interest.  Don't you deserve the interest more then the lender?  I think you do.  

I don't work for any of the above mentioned ways to save.  I do hold accounts (Individual Roth IRA, Individual investing plan, Individual trading account, MMF and a Visa Card through Bank One attained after opening my account with Sharebuilder.) with Sharebuilder.  I have no other interest in Sharebuilder.  I do have a bank account at Bank of America, both checking and savings (opened with $100.00 deposit), but own no stock or other interest in the company.  I am not affiliated with MSN in any way or form and do not own any company stock.  Investments may loose money and in many cases are not FDIC insured.  Any investment should be after careful consideration by the investor before investing.  Your results may very.  (think that covers the Brochure law.)

Good luck and let me know how you do.</td>

<td>Is the stock RIMM a good buy today?</td>
<td>While Research in Motion (NasdaqNM:RIMM) seems to have pulled away via settlement from having continued problems with NTP Inc. by way of a $612.5 million "full and final settlement of all claims," one must consider RIM's management as perhaps too captivated by their own press releases and the alleged validity of their claim to have allowed the case to drag as it did in the face of substantial technological and installed/potential customer base. 

Indeed, the comments by James Balsillie, RIM's co-chief executive, that RIM was "taking one for the team" and that RIM does not feel "good" about the settlement do not indicate that there is any responsible recognition on behalf of RIM that the situation should and could have been handled better.  

When investing, one must look at a company's profile and activities, but also the substantive wisdom of the management team.  In this instance, I would say that the team was found a bit too puerile in their activities.

That said, if one were still so inclined to consider RIMM, I would shy away until the stabilization after this news and the price moves toward US$63.

I invest in 2 diffrent ways.

1st What do people do at all times?
They get married,divorced, children born, loved ones die, get a new job, get fired, buy a house or lose it all. 

They drink. I have invested in booze rather well. It's not something that is going to make you rich but it will be safe and keep up with inflation. It's like plumbing, people might quit smokeing or drinking but nobody is going to quit hitting the head.

2nd i have invested in what the military is useing. The company that makes medals and makes uniforms. Gerber Blades and Leather man Paratools. Everyone has one. General Dynamics makes alot of the communications and electronics for tanks and troops. ect.

I'm not rich but when i retire i can just live and spoil my grand children.

One more. Invest in yourself. Going to school and buying land. Own a home. Own your car. Invest in things that you enjoy collecting (I collect coins). Get a good retirement fund. (I use TPS, it's the government reitrement program for Federal workers). 15% per paycheck.

Swiss Bank Accounts are multi currency. This means you can keep a USD Balance and a Euros Balance and a Yen Balance and so on.

I recommend Scottrade its only $40 to open an account($500 min.)there are NO mantainance/hidden fees and trades are only $7 for unlimited shares(unless they under $1) they also pay interest(monthly) on your cash balances and charge no inactivity fees. With a $2500 balance you can even get a checking account so you'll have easy access to your profits.  

As a day trader I've used their services over 5 years now and have tried to find a better deal. Sure, there are places that advertise trades for as little as $1 but they more than make up for it with hidden/maintainance fees or activity requirements. Scottrade is straight up they never pulled any crap like this on me or anyone else i'm aware of.

The "make money quick" part is entirely up to you, this takes a good understanding of how the markets work, which is more than i can tell you here but, i will refer you to a good beginners resource. Read Jim Cramers' book "Real Money" it will knock years off the learning needed to become a successful trader/investor.

The reason it can only become better is because Iraq is a war-torn country that happens to be very wealthy. The United States and other western countries are currently investing billions and billions of dollars in Iraq. If our governments are investing in Iraq, then I think it’s a fairly good indication that we should too. Governments are not in the business of giving money away without any kind of return. I believe our governments intend to see Iraq flourish. Once that happens, the Iraqi Dinar can only go up.

Mutual Funds also invest in Bonds, in Money markets, these fund schemes are known as debt schemes.

However, in India now and globally, equity related paper and schemes have historically given a return of 10-20% over medium to long term - which csome people define as 3 to 7 years. 

The advantage of investing in a mutual fund is risk mitigation, your risk is spread since the fund manager invests in a number of companies, even if prices of some companies shares went down, those of others are likely to go up ar remain unaltered, hence the negative impact is mitigated or reduced. 

Every AMC (Asset Management Company - they are the trustees of the Mutual Fund) in India reports the  NAV (Net Asset Value) of each of their schemes by 8.00 PM on the days on which the Stock Exchange is open. The NAV can be found on http://www.amfiindia.com

A word of caution: Don't invest all your funds in one asset class only-spread your investments across variuos asset classes, which can include even bank Fixed Deposits. Correct Financial Planning is a must for wealth creation and growth.

The plan usually lets the employee invest a percentage of their income (via payroll deductions) in a small selection of mutual funds (or company stock). Often, the company matches a certain level of contribution. The catch is, you can't get at the money until you are 55 or so. Actually, you can, but you end up paying large penalties.

<td>what are the major differences between a biotech and pharmaceutical company?</td>
<td>It is more of a historical finding that biotech companies are involved in tools and pharmaceutical companies are developing products/therapeutics.  In today's world, both types of companies are engaged in developing new therapies.

Pharmaceutical companies develop "drugs" (also known as small molecules).  Historically these have been discovered by a blend of luck and science, and have been molecules that are not very well targeted (they can do lots of good and bad things in the body, but ideally the good outweighs the bad).  More recently, these drugs have become much more selective.

Biotech companies develop biologics (proteins, antibodies).  These are "natural" in that they are found in nature, but are typically re-engineered in a proprietary way to make them into therapeutics.  In general, they are more targeted (and therefore should be safer).  In general, they are big molecules (so tend to be injected rather than swallowed).  Also, the patent opportunities for biotech companies are much better than for pharmaceutical companies -- you tend to only have one biotech company in a patent position to develop a new antibody against a certain target.

Most recently, these lines have become even more blurred.  Traditional "Pharma" companies are licensing in antibodies and proteins to develop.  And the historically larger Biotech companies (Genentech, Amgen) are starting to acquire and license small molecules.  These companies now start to point to pharma vs. biotech as being a cultural difference -- with biotech companies histoircally smaller and more entrepreneurial (and generally less profitable, as there are only a small handful of profitable biotech companies in the world).</td>

<td>Literally no one lists penny stocks for fear of liability and general concern for the public good . . .  and lack of incentive since NO one would be willing to pay for this information long-term.

Penny stocks are low priced for a reason, most are worthless. Further, most of these stock are thinly traded . . . meaning that technical analysis is worthless in making decisions (you can't trade enough shares to make it worthwhile at a given price.)

It closed at 1248.29 on 30 December 2005.

Therefore it gained 36.37 points over the year which is a 3.00% rise.

Note that the S&amp;P 500 does _not_ include dividends.

The S&amp;P 500 Total Return index (which does include dividends) ended 2004 at 1799.55.  It ended 2005 at 1887.93

<td>What is the best way to learn and get started in stock market investing?</td>
<td>The best way to learn about the stock market is to open up a 401(k) account at work and pick some mutual funds to invest in. At least then, you will lower your taxes and you can start to get the feel for your money fluctuating in value.

You should not invest one dime in the stock market outside of your 401(k) plan until after you establish an emergency fund. This fund should be in cash (CD'S, money market, savings account etc etc) where you can get to it. You should have at least 3 months worth of living expenses in it.

After you do this, you can invest all you want in the stock market....but you have to remember...the stock market is like a casino........dont be greedy.......make some money and get out........financial experts lie to you......the longer you are in the market (casino) the greater your risk is. Your risk doesnt decrease by time horizon.......your risk actually increases the longer your money is in the casino....opps...i mean market.</td>

Some people are not at ease with online banking (but you can contact ING by phone easily).

No bank is always in the top ten for interest rates.

There are two banks for savings that I like:

GMACDirect.com

<td>What to look for in a stock befor you buy it?</td>
<td>Check for solid fudementals, (is the company making money, does it have low debt, are sales increasing, etc.) and Technical indicators that are telling you the stock is going up, ie: price, MACD, Chaikin Money Flow, stochastics, etc.  

Start with Investors.com, the site has a Stock Checkup, a great tool for checking fundamentals on any stock. 

For a more detailed study of Technical Analysis go to StockCharts.com, pay particular attention to the Bollinger Bands, Moving Average, Volume, RSI, the MACD (Mac-D), The Williams %er, Stochastics, and the Chaikin Money Flow.  

Then check out StockTA.com, it is also an excellent Technical Analysis site, with charted Fibonacci resistance and support lines and will tell you if the stock is bullish or bearish in the short, medium and long run.  The site also has an extensive Candle Pattern Glossary and a fantastic technical screener. 

The above sites do have premium services, but all the services I mentioned are free.  I've been using Elliot Wave and Fibonacci's to help refine my in and out points.  StockCharts.com's "ZigZag" overlay helps me plot and count the waves and that helps determine where I am in the overall pattern. 

Basically I find interesting stocks through the screens on Investors.com or StockTA.com, run them through the Stock Checkup at Investors.com, if they measure up I'll run them through the Analyisis &amp; Fib Analysis at StockTA.com and do an extensive chart study at StockCharts.com, examining the 2 yr, 1 yr, 6 mth, 3 mth, 1 mth &amp; 5 day.  I'll also do my due dilligence, studying the profile, key statistics, headlines, etc. through Yahoo Finance and web searches.  If it all measures up and the stock is in a base or in a pull back and it's starting a wave 1 or wave 3, it's time to buy. 

So, to sum it up; you're looking for solid fundamental indicators, and Technical indicators that tell you that the stock is bullish (going up).

I heartily recomend studying the How To Invest section of Investors.com, the Chart School at StockCharts.com, and the School at StockTA.com to further your investment education.

Remember, when investing always protect your downside with a stop loss or a trailing stop loss.  

Good luck, hope it helps.</td>

<td>is e-currency treading reliable?</td>
<td>It depends upon what you mean by reliable.  The US does not regulate in any way the spot market for currency, although I believe the UK does.  If you are standing in the UK then yes.

The reason is that anyone can sell any physical asset in the US for anything they want at common law.  If you mean will they still be online, that depends upon the firm.  If you mean, will I get a fair price, then it depends.

I know of a number of currency traders who were not able to get real market prices on their quotes after long periods of reliable trades.  When you trade currency you are only trading with the firm that is being traded through. You may think that it is going into the market, but it is not.  If that firm is losing money in a particular type of trade it is legal to offer its customers any price it can get people to take.  It does not need to be fair in any way.  It can create losses for you when other people are making gains.  There are no rules for fairness in any currency trading even face to face with a bank.

A better bet is to find an online broker and trade short term foreign debt as a proxy for currencies.</td>

The value of the old company could have a lot to do with the value of the merged company.  All of the assets fo the old company are now part of the merged company, and those assets can have a large impact on value.</td>

<td>Mutual Fund!!!???</td>
<td>Absolute Return is the return that an asset achieves over a period of time. This measure simply looks at the appreciation or depreciation that an asset make over a period of time.

However return is not the same every year, A mutual fund  might be up 40% one year and down 5% the next. Compound Annual Return provides the annual return for such an investment as if it had grown at a steady, even pace. In other words, it tells you how much you would have to earn each year, compounded on your principal to arrive at the final selling value. 

For example if you buy some mutual fund for $1000, 1 year later it is worth $1100, the absolute return for first year is 10%. At the end of year 2, it become worth $1440, the absolute return for second year is 30.9% (340/1100). But in term of compound annual return, it is 20% for these 2 years period. 1st year $1000x1.2=$1200, 2nd year $1200x1.2=$1440.</td>

There you can invest money to earn 10% a month compounded! After testing with 100.00 it works, and so I invested more, four different options, all 10% a month, "offshore investing".
Examples of compounding: 1000.00 after one year: 3130.00.
or, 200.00 after 5 years: 60,000.00
Do it, and forget it for 5 years, you'll not be sorry.

<td>What is the best, simplest,  most tactical, and least expensive way of finding investors 4 business'?</td>
<td>Attracting investors is one of the hardest things to do in business.  Success atracts success.  What you need more than anything is a complete business plan that shows the realistic potential for growth and a profit and loss statement that shows you are meeting your stated goals.  

Next, lets back up here.  The first thing an investor is going to see is that your time is too divided.  Starting a new business takes insane amounts of energy, time, and overall dedication.  Trying to start three at one time you might as well shoot yourself in the foot. The best thing for you to do is pick one of the above to focus on.  Personally, I like the bake shop the best because it is a real business and it is franchiseable if it is done right. 
   
When an investor looks at your business they will look at potential for growth and what assets are available in case of liquidation to cover their losses.  In all three of your business ideas there is very little in the way of either.
I understand the other two ideas are "real", but an investor is going to want to see cashflow, transperancy of books, real potential, and will want to have a member of his team on your board of directors for oversight.  Investors will want to see a well planned out business plan that shows them how they can realistically expect a 20% to 30% equity position and return (minimum) on their investment.  

In order to attract an investor you will probably need to incorporate.  A corporation is its own identity, IE an unnatural person.  It can own property, be sued, and sue.  You don't own a corporation, you work for one, even if you own 51%+ of the stock.  A "C" corp is the most common and most likely the best choice for you.  Most businesses incorporate in Nevada or Delaware, and there are pluses and minuses to incorporating there, but that is more research for you at a later time.  Incorporating allows you some levels of protection from personally being sued and it allows you to divide up ownership with investors cleanly by selling stock.  

At this point stock is free to you.  You, as President, treasurer, and secretary authorize X number of shares at par value (usally 50,000,000 shares at .001 cent each).  Then you sell it to an investor based on some calculation. Wihtout using any multipliers a stock would be worth profit divided by the number of shares.  So $250,000 in profit divided by 50,000,000 is a value of $.005 or half a cent per share.  You can sell the stock for this amount as a true value, you can discount it as an incentive, or you can raise the price if you have a strong enough argument to show that the cashflow will be significantly higher in the following quarters or years.  In order to attract investors you will need to show huge dollar signs and it has to be realistic. This can be shown by eventually (&lt;5 years) taking the company public.  

Don't be worried that you are selling off millions and millions of shares.  If you can go public at $5 in a few years and you still have 10,000,000 shares in your name...hmm...that's still $50,000,000.  Not bad.  Now you can go tinker with inventions and do it right.

One of the reasons going public is a good strategy is that the investor will need a clear exit strategy before they invest.  If they have a ton of private stock that no one wants it isn't worth anything to them.  They need to be able to liquidate eventually.  The business can buy back the shares as well, but it is going to have to have the cashflow to do it.  


Don't even waste time trying a bank.  The old saying "A bank will only lend money when you don't need it" has certainly been true for me.  Personally I would stay away from family because when things dont work out it messes up more than financial situations.  For you to find an investor on your own would be incredibly lucky at this stage.  Maybe you just happen to get paired up with someone on the golf course that has th</td>

<td>Consumer/Investor sentiment is more important to investment decisions than variations in interest rates??</td>
<td>I think that consumer confidence has a lot to do with investment decisions. We can see that by the stock bubble of the late 1990's. Even though our federal reserve chairman was stating that tech stocks were widly overvalued, consumers continued to plow money away into them because they were so "hot". Consumers were investing on speculation and opportunity rather than proven results and profits.

But then again, it can be argued that variations in interest rates fuel purchasing decisions too. As we were beginning to see the federal reserve rate rise, we saw a record number of people buying houses trying to lock in our historically low interest rates for 30+ years. 

So, depending upon the industry, and the magnititude of the purchase, consumers behave differently.

Good luck on your thesis!</td>

I see you posted this in the investment category... my question is if you have nothing (or little) to invest... why would you post this here?  Shouldn't you be looking for a way to increase your income so that you can increase the amount you have to invest.  Anyone who tells you you can make millions without any work or effort (or capital) is just looking to take what little capital you do have from you.  There are many programs out there that will allow you to create an income from home, but any that are legit will require time and effort.  If you are willing to committ to "work" to increase your income... I can show you an opportunity that has helped us to suppliment our income.  I am not referring to a get rich quick scheme... this is a legit business that you can work on your own around your current schedule.  I would not promise you unrealistic amounts of cash... just the training and support to help you to reach your goals... provided of course that you are willing to put forth the effort.

<td>First, I would make sure you have at least 3 months salary saved up at the bank or in a money market fund for an emergency fund.  Financial disasters like getting layed off or sick happen to all of us.
Second,  I would start paying off all high interest debt.  Pay off everything you can except the house mortgage.  Paying off debt is one of the best investments you can make.  You will have more money in the future because you won't have credit card bills to pay.
Third, if you have money left, start investing at a mutual fund company.  I like Vanguard.com.  If you don't like risk, invest your money in a money market fund.  If you like lots of risk with a higher return, invest in their diversified stock funds, like the Total Stock Market Index Fund.  If you are like most people you will invest part of your money conservatively, in money market funds and bond funds,  and part aggressively in stock funds.  Vanguard.com has an on-line questionnaire which will give you an idea how aggressive you want to be.

Invest the other 20$ in an Stock Index ETF. Returns in six years will vary, but you have a good chance of winning a healthy percentage and a extremely small chance of loosing more than a third in six years.

<td>What is the value of my equity in this company?</td>
<td>Good question. To the best of my understanding, value of equity is what the "market" is willing to pay for it. In other words if you purchase it today at 5 cents a share, that is the value, but tomorrow if you can sell it for 6 cents a share, that will be the value since the market is willing to pay 6 cents for it. I think of the "value" as the "market price". This is driven by "expectation" of future growth of the company. If the company fails to meet this expectation, the value diminishes also. This is the way a "growth investor" thinks.

There is another school of investors known as "value investor". That is completely different ball game. They try to compute the value of the company based on "present" business condition based on very very very very complex formula that uses current revenue, cash flow, free cashflow, roe, debt, current intrest rate, inflation, currency value, and many more parameters. In their way of thinking, they try to get a bargain by computing the "present" value which should be higher than the "market price", so they buy the equity at current market price, and sell when the current market price catches up with the value.</td>

<td>What should I do with £50k to make more money?</td>
<td>The answer to this depends on what you will need the money for, and when you'll need it.  If it's anything over 10 years (ie retirement, kids' college education, saving for that vacation home, etc), equities-based investments are the way to go.  Long term, they've average an 11% return, compared to 6.8% for real estate, 5% for bonds, and 2.5% for cash investments.  Of course, stocks are a lot more volatile than most other kinds of investments (excepting commodities, of course), so short-term, a mostly-stock portfolio is a no-go.  

Indiviudal stocks are usually way too risky to even bother with, to be even more forthcoming. In 2000, you could have invested in the #1 energy company in the U.S., or the #2 phone company.  What could have been more stable than a couple of leading utilities?  Ask the shareholders of Enron and Worldcom, respectively.  No, a far smarter, and safer, way to get that needed equity exposure is through high-quality mutual funds.  I'm not talking the junky tech-bombs that exploded on the scene the late 90's.  I'm talking about quality funds that own quality stocks, and have a quality track record to back it up.

No matter what route you go with, the most important thing is to DIVERSIFY.  Diversify, diversify, diversify.  I can't say it enough.  A good rule of thumb for most people is that your age should be the percentage you are in fixed income investments, like bonds, CDs, and cash.  Thus, the older you get, the more conservative you'll become.  Of course, your individual risk tolerance will vary.

Assuming you are 25, a sample portfolio like the following will be sufficient:

20% Large-cap stocks
20% Mid/small cap stocks
20% International stocks
5% Real Estate Investments
5% Commodities
5% Precious Metals
10% Governmet bonds
10% Corporate Bonds
5% International bonds

As daunting as that may or may not look, it can be achieved very easily through just a few mutual funds.  Consult a financial advisor, or do the research yourself if you have the time, tools, and talent.  Oh, and the discipline.  That's probably the #1 reason people go to financial advisors:  they realize they don't have the discipline to stick with a plan on their own.

A portfolio like the one above should average 8-10% annually, or better.  They key is that all the different asset calsses behave differently when the same economic event happens, like, say, interest rates risiin, or a war starting in Bulgaria.  Stocks behave differently than bonds, which behave differently than commodities, which behave differently tha real estate, etc.

Using the "Rule of 72", where you divide teh number 72 by your return % to see how often your money will double, we see that if this portfolio is earning 8%, it will double every 9 years.  Compare that to a money market earning 2%, which will double every 36 years! 

Thus, in 9 years, we can expect the diversified portfolio to be 100k, in 18 years 200k, in 27 years 400k, in 36 years 800k, in 45 years 1.6million, and in 54 years 3.2 million.  Thus we illustrate  the power of compounding, which Albert Einstein called mankind's greatest invention.  It also illustrates the power of starting early!

As a completist, I'll just mention that if the portfolio eanred 10%m it would double every 7 years or so, so that it would actually reach that 3.2 million number in only 43 years.  At 12%, it would reach it in just 36 years.  

Hope this helps!

Are you trading stocks, commodities, futures, options, or all of these? If the latter, TerraNova is the only one that you can trade everything, real time, online, direct access. A lot of online brokerages claim to give you direct access, but if they take more than a second to execute your trade, it aint direct.

Find the articles online that have evaluated and compared online brokerages. I found a good one in Barron's, but you'll find others in the trading magazines. 

This is worth putting a little time and effort into, because it's a pain to switch, so once you choose, you're kinda stuck with it. 

Townsend Electronics, the Parent company of TerraNova, is the one that digitized and electronified the Nasdaq. They are technological industry leaders and have a powerful and well built trading system. 

I use RealTick, but it costs $275/mo, even though it is unlimited what you can do with it. What you should try is a free trial of their Investor platform, which is free. You only get one window to trade from, but hey, with $5,000-how many stocks are you going to watch? Their rates are good also, but of course, it depends on how often you trade. 

TerraNova is the home of the Day Trader, so they thinnk nothing of you making several hundred trades a day. You don't have to do that, but it's okay here if you do.</td>

If interest rates go up to 11%, to pay its coupon payment of 10, the value has to drop to 90.9 to match up.

Similarly, if interest rates go to 9%, to get a coupon of 10, the value has to go up to 111.11 to match up and give the same coupon.

So, when rates rise, the price goes down and vice versa.</td>

<td>what is the purposed outlook on the Iraqi dinar?and when will it start being traded?will it go up in value.?</td>
<td>Investors speculate that the value of 1 Iraqi Dinar can reach to between $0.01 - $3.00. A more conservative speculation would be between $0.10-$0.30, which is quite substantial if you think about it. Consider buying 1 million Iraqi Dinar today for $1000. If the value of 1 Iraqi Dinar goes up to just 10 cents US, your investment would automatically be worth $100,000. A return like that is truly supreme. Will it happen? That’s the question.

No one really knows if the value of the Iraqi Dinar is going to increase or when. It really is anyone’s guess. My personal opinion is that should the Iraqi Dinar begin to increase in value it will not happen until the war in Iraq is complete. At that time Iraq will begin to rebuild its country and economy. And once the economy becomes strong, so should the currency. 

I also believe that the currency will not be traded before the war is up. Iraq wants to introduce a strong currency to the world, not a weak one. I hope this answers your question.</td>

<td>What should you know before you bid a vacant land on an auction? Who should I seek advice after I bought it?</td>
<td>When ever you are going to buy or bid for a land, make it a point that you have gathered enough information about it and land which is available close to it. This would help you know the amount for which you have to bid, the return which you'll be able to get when you sell it, for what purpose you can use it, etc.

To take a advice about the land, ask a reputed Property dealer, or the local authority.

To be a successful Land auction bidder the first thing which you have to keep in mind is that "Dont bid for the land if the bidding price has taken over the market price until the land promises to give better return even after you have bought it for higher price"

Secondaly, Know the purpose for which you are buying it, whether you want to sell it later, or use it for securing future by building a house.

Thirdly if you are thinking of selling it later, try and carry out some small scale busines on it so that you can also earn revenue on it while it is vacant. This would also add to the value

Fourth, Try and collect information on the areas around it, because if in short term or long term there would be development in that area, the price of the land will shoot up.

In the end it is better to invest in land, as there would be rare chances that the price of a land would decrease.

All the best.</td>

If the Oil goes up so does everything else.
If everything else goes up less people buy it and if less people buy it there is less profits and if there is less profits the stock goes down and if the stock goes down everybody loses money (I asume you have at least a few stocks and if you don't you should) and if everybody loses money you cannot buy more oil based things and if you cannot buy more oil based things the companies makes less money and that means less profits and wait a minute!

<td>Emerging market's higher volatility is a natural consequence of their size and state of development and has nothing to do with pressure being put on the country by other countries nor does the emerging market country itself like having the higher volatility.

Emerging markets are volatile because they are smaller economies with fewer investors than the larger economies.  Fewer investors means that each person's stake in the economy is higher. if a few people get scared and pull their money out, that has a bigger impact that it would in a larger economy.  This higher impact leads to higher volatility.

Emerging economies are also likely have a higher percentage of foreign investors.  Foreign investors are more likely to pull their money out of an investment than a local person.</td>

<td>The best way to do anything yourself is to learn something about it first. You'd be surprised at the thousands of books available on this one subject at your local library.

But most people spend more time deciding the color of their new car, than they do on a mutual fund advisor, for example. 

Are you really wanting to do this yourself, or are you asking about someone who is an expert who can do it for you?

If you invest in the stock market right now, or just buy into all the ETF's you can afford, it's a crap shoot, like rolling the dice, and the odds are probably not in your favor, whether you have an expert fund manager or not, because mutual funds are always "in" the market.

They say "Buy and Hold" for the long term is better, but that depends on when you get in, and what your definiton of "long term" is. 

The Dow is now approaching all-time highs last seen in Jan 2000, so if your long-term definition is more than seven years, then you won't mind waiting another seven years for a profit. There have been periods of over twenty years when the Dow went nowhere. This is not investing, but rather blind hope.

For most people, the name of the game is capital preservation. When the risks are high, like right now, you get out of the stock and bond markets and park your cash in a interest bearing money market fund or CD or Treasury Bill.

This is simply not a good entry point for investors. Be patient, wait a few months, and you'll be able to buy much more stock a lot cheaper, the risks will be lower (even though they will seem higher), and your chance of success greater.

If you wish to research the “Buy and Hold Strategy” further, or perhaps trade yourself, I recommend two book titles. One is called "Which Is Better, Buy-and-Hold or Market Timing?" The other is "Do You Have What It Takes to Be a Market Timer?" They will give you plenty to think about.</td>

<td>What are "Short Selling" and "Buy to Cover"?</td>
<td>Short selling means borrowing some shares and selling them with the promise to buy them back later.  Buying them back later is called "buy to cover."  You make money if the stock goes down.

Example:  Stock is at 100.  You short it, so you sell it at 100.  Let's say it goes to 90.  You buy it back and return the shares.  So, you make the 10 because you bought at 90 and sold at 100.  You lose money in the opposite case where the stock goes up.</td>

<td>How to start investing on the stock market, starting with opening an account?</td>
<td>Well first you need to find a broker. Like ameritrade, scottrade, e-trade, td waterhouse, shwab, ect. 

Personally I use scottrade. only $7 to make a trade unlimited shares, market and limit, no maintenance fees, no inactivity fees or any fees unless you specifically use a service that has a fee, but you will know before you are charged.  

Then once you have contacted a broker and opened an account you can start making trades. The key to success is to make an inversting strategy and follow it. A strategy can be anything, like you might buy stocks between 5-10 dollars, volumes greator than 1 million on a 3 month avg, that have recently had management changes. You then take that list of companies and choose the best one/s. You may also want to diversify by buying companies with negative correlations to decrease risk. But you can do what ever you want.

For more information call scottrade they have people sitting around that can answer any question you have about investing, even if you don't have an account.</td>

Also professional managers take care of the investing and do much better than we could ever do.  Second, I find the best way is to make the investment LONG TERM, let it sit no matter and over time I have found my investments always do well.

<td>what is the best way to buy shares of stock of your favorite items?</td>
<td>the best way to buy shares of your favorite stock is go directly through the company. The only catch is that some companies do not offer this option because an investment banking house such as Morgan Stanley, may make a market or sell the stock on the open market, for the company. Another way to say it is that the company you may want to buy shares in may not handle their own stock. Look on the company website under investor relations for an answer to that. If they dont offer stock, then find a low cost, internet based stock trading company such as ameritrade etc. But, buyer beware, just cause you know the company, doesnt mean you know the stock.

<td>What's the difference between FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) &amp; FII (Foreign Institutional Investors)??</td>
<td>FII (Foreign Institutional Investors) - An investor or investment fund that is from or registered in a country outside of the one in which it is currently investing. Institutional investors include hedge funds, insurance companies, pension funds and mutual funds.
The term is used most commonly in India to refer to outside companies investing in the financial markets of India. International institutional investors must register with the Securities and Exchange Board of India to participate in the market. One of the major market regulations pertaining to FIIs involves placing limits on FII ownership in Indian companies.

FDI  (Foreign Direct Investment)- An investment abroad, usually where the company being invested in is controlled by the foreign corporation. An example of FDI is an American company taking a majority stake in a company in China.

So while the dictionary gives almost the same meaning  for both, I think the word "Institutional"  refers to the organizations doing the investment vs single investor, while FDI can be done either by a single person or by organization.

Hope this helps.
Good luck.</td>

<td>what is a good penny stock to pick?</td>
<td>If you want to teach your son about the stock market, DO NOT start off using penny stocks.  You might as well bring him down to the race track and teach him about the ponies.. or buy lottery tickets and teach him how states make money.

If you want to start off with small amounts of money, it doesn't mean the stock price needs to be small too.  Just buy 1 or 2 shares of Disney or whatever.

Companies that trade at pennies for the dollar trade there for a reason - because they are probably worthless.  Sure you may be able to trade around these things.. maybe buy something at 12 cents and sell it for 15 cents as long as there are bigger idiots willing to try to pump it up.  But you should not be teaching your son how to trade (and probably lose money).  You should be teaching him how to INVEST.  Buy good companies that are good at making money and producing real cashflow.  Let him pick his favorite toy or video game and find out what company makes it..  or pick the company that makes his favorite food.. whatever.  Teach him that with even a small amount of money, he too can own a small piece of a company that makes some of his favorite things.  

I guarantee you they won't include penny stocks.</td>

<td>what does a widening bid-ask stock option spread mean?</td>
<td>There are several possible reasons for this.  People who make markets in options are effectively making markets in the uncertainty underlying the stock price.  If the bid- ask spread is widening, then that could mean that the market makers have less certainty about the future volatility (price-swingyness) of the stock. If there is a big story in the company, that could lead to such an effect. 

Another potential reason could be that the stock itself has got a wider bid-ofer spread.  The option market maker has to base his price partially on the stock price, and if the bid offer of the stock is widening, then the bid-offer of the options will generally get wider by an ratio called the "delta" of the option, which is between 0 and 1.</td>

<td>can anyone tell me about the iraq dinars.?</td>
<td>New Iraqi Currency
Iraq has a cash driven society where banks are seldom viewed as places to store consumer wealth and communications between branches of even the same bank are often difficult to conduct and rely mostly on face-to-face meetings to update account balances rather than the use of automated networks. The flow of funds in Iraq’s economy in general is more often than not, one of funds flowing out from banks with very little recirculation as is experienced in other societies. 

Why does this happen? It’s a result of “learned behavior” including consumer experiences dating back to the end of the first Iran-Iraq war. During this timeframe, the former dictator found the country nearly broke and faced with making millions in stipend payments to returning soldiers. To generate cash, he instructed all banks to stop making payments other than those needed to pay government workers. Most who stored their wealth in the banking system lost everything. Accordingly, the current distrust in the banking system will take time and consumer education to overcome. 

The population of any type of currency in banks given the current security situation makes such movements risky to the extent that it is often difficult for Iraq’s own Ministries to keep current on payments to its own workforces. It’s not an uncommon event for the State owned banks to simply run out of cash to make payrolls, and then call for special Coalition assistance to arrange transports of cash to them. 

When officially introduced at the end of the British mandate (1932), the dinar [consisting of 1,000 fils or 20 dirhams] was equal to, and was linked to, the British pound sterling, which at that time was equal to US$4.86. Iraqi dinar (ID) equaled US$4.86 between 1932 and 1949 and after devaluation in 1949, equaled US$2.80 between 1949 and 1971. Iraq officially uncoupled the dinar from the pound sterling as a gesture of independence in 1959, but the dinar remained at parity with the pound until the British unit of currency was again devalued in 1967. 

One Iraqi dinar remained equal to US$2.80 until December 1971, when major realignments of world currencies began. Upon the devaluation of the United States dollar in 1973, the Iraqi dinar appreciated to US$3.39. It remained at this level until the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq War in 1980. In 1982 Iraq devalued the dinar by 5 percent, to a value equal to US$3.22, and sustained this official exchange rate without additional devaluation despite mounting debt. In early 1988, the official dinar-dollar exchange rate was still ID1 to US$3.22; however, with estimates of the nation's inflation rate ranging from 25 percent to 50 percent per year in 1985 and 1986, the dinar's real transaction value, or black market exchange rate, was far lower-- only about half the 1986 official rate. 

The Iraqi dinar was worth $US3.20 before the United Nations embargo that followed Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. By August 2002 it was trading at just below 2000 to the US dollar, and by mid-April 2003 it had slipped to anywhere between 3500 and 4000 against the dollar. In July 2003 one US dollar equaled about 1,500 Iraqi dinars. Nearly all the bank notes issued after the 1991 Gulf War were without watermark or metal line due to technical difficulties, which is why so many forgeries took place. 

In April 2003, following the end of major combat operations, the Iraqi economy was in distress because of closure of oil sales, imposition of UN sanctions. At that time, United States officials said that a new currency was needed, to introduce some stability. Without a proper currency in circulation there was a fear of inflation. The US decided to distribute $20 bills to the civil servents to boost the economy. This was not an issue of "dollarizing" the economy, but to get money that had real value into people's hands.

<td>Thin Kaboutit is entirely correct.  When a company goes into bankruptcy (which may still happen, you just don't know) then one of several things might happen.  First, it may never come out of bankruptcy, so your purchase is worthless.  Second, it might manage to come out of bankruptcy, but get rid of all it's old shares.  This is perfectly legal and has happened to many people who bought stocks like this, especially around 2000-2003.  In this case you are entirely out your money.  In a few cases, they may actually come out of bankruptcy, devaluate their old shares, and offer you something in exchange (like warrants-Chiquita did that a few years ago, for example).  And if you are VERY lucky, it may actually work for you.  But your odds are quite small.  There is no telling where Delta is going right now, if you decide you want to take a chance, just don't invest money you can't afford to loose.</td>

I'd guess if you're willing to buy a "fixer-upper" and put some time and money into it, then three years would be okay.  Lots of folks can make good money "flipping" houses like that.  Otherwise, you might be better off just renting.  If it was longer, I'd say go ahead, buy.  If it was any shorter, I'd say definitely rent.  You're really on the cusp with three years....

<td>How do I start buying stock with 1,000.00? Do I put it in one stock or more?</td>
<td>bungie, don't rush. I am on the same boat with you. The more you read and understand about stocks, the more you will have an idea where to invest your money. For now, try paper money. Do 1-3 years of intensive learning first before you start investing. Most people will end up as losers if they guess the market (speculating). Short trading is not recommended because of the market fluctuation, commission fees, high taxes etc. Here is one of websites that allow you to extend your knowledge.

If you insist on investing, I suggest you what I read in one book:
"invest in a few basket, not one or diversify." But I recommend to put into CD or national treasure first (check the yield) until you have surplus in your paper money account.</td>

<td>Why is it better to short sell an overvalued stock and buy a different undervalued stock, rather than.....?</td>
<td>It may or may not be. But lets assume that it is. If the stock is very much overvalued, then there is a very good probability that the price of that stock will fall back to a more reasonable level at some point. Short selling it will take advantage of that fall in price and result in a gain for the short seller. 

 However, the short sale can be risky because of Newtons 1st law. A body in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force. A stock that has been rising in price will tend to continue rising in price. If you do not believe that, go back and look at the charts of the internet stocks of 1999. They were overvalued by many factors, but they kept on rising.  Short sellers, if they can act in coordination, can sometimes make Newtons 1st law work for them, by supplying the external force. They do that by flooding the market with stock and overwhelming demand with supply.  The SEC takes a dim view of that tactic, and has instituted rules that work against short sellers in the securities markets. In the commodities markets, those rules do not exist and short selling can function more effectively.</td>

<td>Can the wall street stock market crash ?</td>
<td>The only way the stock market would crash again is if everyone borrows money from banks to invest in stocks and never pay the money back. For example buyer A borrows money from the bank and buys stock. buyer A then sells his stock, that he has earned profit off of, to buyer B. buyer B has borrowed money from the bank to purchase from buyer A. buyer b then takes that stock and sells back to buyer A. Buyer A then has borrowed money from the bank to afford the price of the stock buyer B has asked for. this goes on and on, borrowing money from the banks and niether of the buyers has payed the banks back which makes the banks go into default and this results in a stock market crash. so as long as people do not borrow too much money and pay back their loans, we should not have to worry about a depression.

You can get around the non-US address incompatibility with US address input fields in several ways:

1) For those who offer two address inputs (i.e. "Permanent" and "Mailing") input each US and non-US address, and synchronise the addresses online once your account is established.

2) Don't apply for the account online; rather print the form and handwrite and/or call the customer service rep for assistance (which is good way to test the customer service quality of your intended brokerage)</td>

With significant points on the trendline, this increases its significance greatly. If profit taking was not down on the 2 day reversal there was another chance which was when the trend was broken. Before the 2 day reversal, the stock has shown that it was exhausted with an exhaustion gap from the 2 day reversal. The stock has hinted many technical faults.

The next support level the stock has is at the $2.40 level.

PLATINUM AND PALLADIUM DEMAND TO OUTPACE SUPPLY, SUSTAINING HIGH PRICES

Demand for platinum and palladium in 2000 will again exceed supply, maintaining prices near to recent highs, according to Johnson Matthey in its PLATINUM 2000 INTERIM REVIEW, published today. 

PLATINUM demand is expected to rise by 2% to a new record of 5.69 million oz, with demand from jewellery, autocatalyst and industrial applications all advancing. Purchases of platinum by the auto industry will rise for the first time in 4 years, principally to meet stricter emissions limits for diesel cars in Europe. Higher platinum prices have had some impact on demand for jewellery in Japan, but have not prevented further growth in demand from China, the USA and Europe. Investment demand is expected to be negative as a result of profit-taking by holders of platinum investment bars in Japan. 

Supplies of platinum will rise by 11% to 5.41 million oz, with substantially higher shipments expected from Russia following amendments to the legislation that inhibited exports in 1999. This will still leave the market in deficit by 280,000 oz and the platinum price, which reached an 12-year high of $612 in August 2000, is predicted to remain firm in the range $560-$630 for the next six months. 

Demand for PALLADIUM is forecast to fall by 10% to 8.4 million oz. The use of palladium in autocatalysts is still growing, but purchases by the auto industry are forecast to decline by 12%, with some auto companies drawing heavily on their palladium stocks. Dental demand for palladium has fallen sharply in reaction to the higher price, but in the electronics industry dramatic growth in the production of capacitors will lead to increased demand for palladium. Total supplies of palladium in 2000 will decline 2% to 7.92 million oz, with shipments from Russia expected to fall marginally due to lower sales from government stocks, resulting in a deficit for a 4th successive year. 

With demand for palladium continuing to exceed mine production, the level and pattern of Russian sales will continue to be the main influence on the price. Palladium reached a record $855 in August 2000 and for the next six months Johnson Matthey expects the metal to trade in the range of $700 to $850."</td>

<td>How can I invest $1000 in Banking institutions to get richer. Thanks?</td>
<td>Buy a diversified series of mutual funds.  Make sure you hit all the assets classes, like Large cap stocks, small/mid cap stocks, international stocks, emerging markets stocks, government debt, corporate debt, hi-yield debt, foreign debt, emerging markets debt, real estate, commodities, and precious metals.  That's 12 categories right there, so with $1000, you're talking about $83 each.  Why not spring for an extra 200 bucks, and start each off with $100 even?  

Then sit back and rebalance each year, back to your original percentages.  This is called asset allocation.  The thinking being, what's BEEN hot is more than likely not going to STAY hot.  

This sort of portfolio should average 8-12% per year, so jsut split the difference and say 10%.  Will it do 10% EVERY year? Of course not.  I'd be surprised if it ever did EXACTLY 10%.  That's an annual average.  With that average, your money should double roughly every 7 years.  
So, in 7 years you should have about $2,000
in 14 years you should have about $4,000
in 21 years you should have about $8,000
in 28 years you should have about $16,000
in 35 years you should have about $32,000
in 42 years you should have about $64,000
in 49 years you should have about $128,000
in 56 years you should have about $256,000
in 63 years you should have about $512,000
in 70 years you should have about $1,024,000!

Of course, if you keep adding money in, say $100 a month, you'll become a millionaire MUCH sooner.  The key is discipline, and sticking in when markets are up OR down.  Don't try to time the market--you'll NEVER get it right.

Oh, and if you qualify, and do this all in a Roth IRA?  Then every penny will be 100% TAX-FREE.  That's a deal that's too good to pass up.  That's why I tell all my under-30 clients--if you make under $90,000, and therefore qualify to do a Roth, you'd be a fool not to.  Just having the power of youth (and therefore time) on your side is such an advantage, to squander it would be such a waste!

Hope this helps!

hedge fund : 

A type of investment fund where the managers are allowed to use riskier trading techniques to try to gain a higher return on investment. For example, hedge funds are allowed to use shortselling, which other mutual funds are unable to do. Because of the higher risk involved in a hedge fund, only wealthy individuals and companies are generally allowed to invest and there is often a minimum investment

If they don't have a 401K plan and you take the money, unless you are 59 and 1/2 or meet one of the few other exceptions, you will pay a 10% penalty in addition to the income tax for an early withdrawal.  ALso, the age at which you can draw full sociail security benefits is increasing.

<td>what kind of Bank a/c should I open for doing Stocks/ MF trading?</td>
<td>Simply open an account with a broker - I recommend an internet broker such as E*Trade.  They are cheaper but do not offer any advice - you have to decide when to buy or sell.  

There are 2 types of brokerage accounts - cash and margin.  In a cash account you must pay for stock purchased within 5 days of your purchase.  This is the only approach for a beginner.  

DO NOT TAKE DELIVERY OF YOU SHARES - leave them with your broker - they are safe there and if you have them and loose them they transact like cash and there is no insurance against theft etc. Also when your broker holds the shares you can make an immediate sale without sending the shares back to the broker via registered mail. 

After you build up your account (amount depends upon the broker and your holdings) you will be able to switch to a margin account.  In this type of account you buy stock on the strength of the stock you hold with the broker (buying on margin).  In other words, if you have 100% equity in say $100,00 in stock, the broker will extend credit of maybe $150,000 and you can buy additional stock up to that amount with no additional cash.  

HOWEVER there are MAJOR pitfalls to buying stock on margin. 1) the broker will charge you interest on the amount you owe and MORE IMPORTANTLY if your holdings begin to slide in the market the broker will sell as many of your holdings as necessary to cover the credit (margin) the broker extended to you - this is referred to as a margin call.  A margin call is done by the broker WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION and depending upon the volatility of the market can happen within hours.. 

Mnay, many, many people have lost everything by over extending their margin buying and then loosing everything via a margin call.  I recommend you only use a margin account to cover your purchases while your check for your purchases in enroute to the broker.</td>

<td>What is Bollinger Bands in stock technical Analysis?</td>
<td>Developed by John Bollinger, Bollinger Bands are an indicator that allows users to compare volatility and relative price levels over a period time. The indicator consists of three bands designed to encompass the majority of a security's price action.
    
A simple moving average in the middle 

An upper band (SMA plus 2 standard deviations) 

A lower band (SMA minus 2 standard deviations) 

Standard deviation is a statistical term that provides a good indication of volatility. Using the standard deviation ensures that the bands will react quickly to price movements and reflect periods of high and low volatility. Sharp price increases (or decreases), and hence volatility, will lead to a widening of the bands.

<td>100 shares of So Calif Edison common stock aquired in 1961would have an est. value of ??? today?</td>
<td>You should be able to call investor relations and just ask them, but maybew they don't konw either.  Anyhow, I assume you are holding the certificate yourself, if this were in an account you'd typically get an account statement with the current value listed.

Unfortunately, most website don't seem to go back that far, but I can think of 3 pretty easy ways to figure it out.  It looks like this company is now Edison International (symbol EIX), unless you have one of the preferred types of stock.  If this is EIX, they should have paid a dividend of .27 cents per share on 3/29 (and another .27 $/share on 12/28/05).  Are you getting these dividends?  If so, simply divide how much money you are getting by .27 to get the number of shares.  Look up the current price on yahoo (currently its about $40 per share) and multiply by the number of shares you calculated.

Option number 2, take the certificate to a stock broker,  open and account, deposit the stock into the account, wait for your first statement.  They will have to figure out exactly what is there themselves.

Option number 3, ask the company for a new stock certificate.  They will send you a certificate saying 1200 shares EIX, or whatever, and you can toss the old one or maybe they will ask you to send it back to them.</td>

If you own stocks, their value has only a rough correlation to the spot price of gold.  In a down market, the stock can drop more than the spot price and stay down there for quite awhile.

<td>how to buy a stock?</td>
<td>I'm not sure what kind of money you are able to invest, so here are 3 scenarios:

If you have over $5,000 you can commit, and feel that you have a decent understanding of the market, call one of the discount brokers.  For simple stock transactions, I would recommend someone very cheap, like Brown &amp; Co.  If you plan to trade mutual funds, bonds, and/or options, go with someone like Schwab or Fidelity.  There are also full-service brokers, but their commissions are very hefty.  They make most sense for peope who have over $50k to invest and don't feel that they have enough free time to research and purchase their own investments.

If you have $2k-5k to invest, I would suggest doing some research on the web - Yahoo! finance, smartmoney.com, etc. - and invest in a mutual fund of your choice instead.  You can almost always call the mutual fund company directly.

If you have less, than $2k, the best option would be to keep accumulating the money in a savings account.  If, however, you are willing to put some work into it, you can still buy stocks.  The cheapest way to do it, is through the Dividend Re-Ivestment Plans [DRIPs].  Most large publicly traded companies run their own plans and will be more than happy to help you out if you contact their investor relations departments.  There are also some websites with relevant information.  No one promotes these, because banks and brokers do not stand to gain anything - the plans are, for the most part, literally free for you to participate in.  The main drawback, is that it may take up to 20 days for you to get your money back, once you decide to liquidate the position - so avoid buying anything with highly volatile stock prices.

<td>What are Convertible Senior Notes?</td>
<td>Convertible Senior Notes are bonds issued by CIEN that are also convertible into CIEN stock at a certain price.  For example, let's say CIEN currently trades at $20 per share.  The convertible notes may be covertible at say, $30 per share.  So if the stock ever reaches $30, than the holders of those bonds can exchange their bonds for stock in the company.  

It's not necessarily good or bad.  It does create possible dilution to the stock since there will be an additional amount of shares issued if the stock goes past the convert price (and the bondholders convert their bonds).  But in general, this will not have a significant impact on the outcome of your stock investment.</td>

<td>How does JP Morgan Partners raise their investment capital? How does one invest in JP Morgan Partners?</td>
<td>JP Morgan Partners is the private equity division of JP Morgan.  They get their money from institutional investors (mutual funds, pension funds etc.) and from high net worth individuals (USD$10MM or up).  Private Equity firms take investors' money and invest in a number of small emerging companies, mostly private companies.  The idea is that when these companies grow and go IPO, that's when they cash out.  It's a high risk game.  Most of these small companies never get off the ground.  But when they do, the potential return could be over 500%.  

Your second question was how to invest in JP Morgan Partners.  Yes, you can buy shares of JPM and you will participate in the fees generated from the private equity firm.  Becareful however, you are NOT really investing in the portfolio of the partnership itself.  The institutional and high net worth investors who put money in are the real owners of the portfolio.  JPM simply makes a fee from operating the private equity firm.</td>

It you have a target price in mind, then sell when it hit's the target.  If you bought it for a long term play, and it no longer looks like a good long term play, then sell it.  If you bought it because you thought it would double in 12 months, and it didn't, then sell it.

If the reason that you bought it is still valid and evident then hold on.

Always have a plan when buying a stock that includes entry price, target price, and stop loss (ie: cut your losses) price.  Making it objective takes the emotion and confusion out of it.</td>

<td>what is the best company to invest stock in? Please someone with alot of stock expirence help.?</td>
<td>I have to disagree with the 1st responder. You do have advantages that the fund managers do not have, and why is it that people get so excited about investing their money in a portfolio of stocks that include both good and bad. I am talking about index funds. 

Sure any investor will make good bets and bad bets. That is just the way it is. But using a little common sense, you can make more good bets than bad bets. 

The advantage that you have that the fund managers, making their millions do not have, is that you are not trying to invest a billion dollars. Investing that much money is not easy. It is almost impossible. 

Look for companies that have a history of increasing earnings and dividends and that are not selling at unreasonably high prices. Here are a couple BAC, CHL, HD, COP.</td>

<td>Can anyone tell me about the concept of day trading and of stock options?</td>
<td>Day trading is buying and selling of a particular stock many times throughout the day.  Throughout the day, a stock price may change due to several things, such as volume (others buying or selling).  Day traders try to take advantage of this by buying the stock on the low swings, and selling it on the high swings.  It usually takes a lot of money to do this in order to make it worth your while.  Day traders often do this with several stocks at once.  

Most on line brokers require a minimum cash account of around ten thousand dollars for you to day trade.  I can't remember the rules exactly, but Ameritrade, considers day trading as buying or selling of the same stock within a couple days.  And if you have two or three instances of this, they classify you as a day trader.

Stock options are something that employers offer to make a job more desirable.  Usually offering company stock on top of their normal pay.  Having stock in a company you work for also makes you care more about your company.</td>

Banks there are quite strong and stable today, they are all interconnected with European economy, so I doubt that something bad will happen.

<td>The Nasdaq jumped 85% in a single year. Why did this happen and what could cause this to happen again.?</td>
<td>Returns on equities securities are Cauchy distributed rather than normally distributed.  What that means is that wide swings are far more common than they should be, if your framework is the "normal" framework.  Such spikes are rare, but do occur several times in the life of anyone who lives long enough.  Such spikes are caused by a sudden increase in demand for shares of companies in the NASDAQ, while others who have those shares hold on to them more than they previously did.  Hence, they become rare or scarce.  Since most bids are market orders, people pay whatever price they have to to buy them.  That does not mean that the price is fair or reasonable.

Such spikes usually occur after a period in which prices are too low for the overall level of demand.

Gold had been doing this for a while and so has petroleum.  Really, you likely have missed the biggest sets of those spikes for a while.  At least that is my guess, most central banks are reducing available cash and sucking money out of those markets.  You might get to see the equivalent drop though in the next few years.</td>

<td>what are the disadvantages of self -publishing your book...?</td>
<td>Agree somewhat with the first post. 

You have to be very, very careful in the self-publishing market, especially with vanity presses. Do you know anyone who has self-published? Ask them for detailed, inside information. I did that after I learned my uncle knew a professor who had self-published his first book. If not, investigate the companies thoroughly.

Yes, you pay everything up front when self-publishing, and even have to buy your own author copies. Some companies, like Dorance (sp) Publishing, might require you to guarantee them that you can sell X number of books before they will print. Other companies like Author House (reputable - I know someone who has used their services, and considered it myself) will sell you publicity and marketing packages along with your self-publishing contract. That way, you can focus on what you do best: write. Unless you've got a mouthpiece of have tons of money to pay in newspaper ads, buying a package such as this might be better, since professionals do this for you, and you have a better chance of selling your books.

I have not really looked into on-demand printing; I dismissed it as an option early on. I learned from someone with experience, that on-demand publishing does not generate a lot of sales. 

The best way to start your journey to becoming a best-selling author is to do your research. Get books like The Novel Writer's Toolkit (if you're writing novels), books on book publicity (tons), and especially the Writers' Market series of books. Go to your library in the writing section and explore. There is tons of information, even how-to books on writing queries, synopses and proposals. You will still need a synopsis and/or propsal even if you intend to self-publish your book.

I have thought about self-publishing my novel, but I have been directed into a different path. I'm working on finding an agent. Writers have much better success, in general, when an agent believes in their work and sells it to a publishing house. If you've never been published, it will be hard, but don't give up on the first no, because there might be a lot of no's.

Good luck, from one author to another.</td>

A riskless bond usually has limited or no price appreciation.  the bond will mature on a known date with a known value.  But a stock can rise and rise in value.

Like the previous answer see how far back the price history is in Yahoo. Perhaps reveunue departments have trade records also. Good Luck</td>

<td>Example:

Suppose your stock's price is $100 at the beginning of the month and $120 at the end. Moreover, suppose if you had deposited $100 at the start of the month to get $115 at the end.

Your overall return from the stock is ($120-$100)/$100=20%
Risk free return during the month is ($115-$100)/$100=15%

Then your monthly excess return is 20%-15%=5%

If you do these calculations for each month and take their averages at the end, you get mean monthly excess return.</td>

<td>Finance: why are not just variable costs included to calculate gross profit? e.g. Labor costs or am I wrong?</td>
<td>You are talking about two different things.  Gross margin (or gross profit) is exactly as you say...Revenue less COGS (which can include everything necessary in directly manufacturing or providing a good/service).  Variable costs and fixed costs are economic conventions to describe the behavior of costs.  Variable costs are perfectly correlated with revenue while fixed costs have no correlation with revenue.  Often, costs are neither fixed nor variable, but a combination of the two.  The electric bill (typicall not found in COGS), for example, probably has some fixed component that would be the same over time even if the business did not produce a single unit.  However, as production increases and electricity utilization rises, the monthly bill will be higher.  Financial statements do not give any information on fixed or variable costs.  Managerial statements can, if they are set up properly.  If you want a statement that shows information on fixed and variable costs, you need to set up a contribution margin statement which shows revenues less variable costs (equals the contribution margin).  Contribution margin is the amount of money left over after paying your variable costs that can be contributed to fixed costs.  This is a really helpful excercise for any business to undergo.</td>

<td>How is the value of an option determined?</td>
<td>The use of Black Scholes Merton is very popular for short-term European option pricing, but there are other models to choose from.  Black Scholes is part of a group of models known as a closed form group, because they are continuous functions (no breaks in the line).  It is very popular to use, because it is a straight forward equation and, once you carefully estimate the parameters, it is very easy to use.  A major flaw of BSM is that it is a non-linear approximation based on one of the equations found in Thermodynamics (I can't remember which one).  So the model does not hold for long-term options or for options that can be exercised at any time (i.e. American options).  

Another group of models, known as lattice models, have gained popularity.  The binomial model was developed at the same time as Black Scholes, but tackles the problem from a different route.  Binomial models say that a price can go up or down, and the result (very simplified) is a weighted average of probablilies and price movements in various scenarios.  The benefit of this model is that expected exercise date and expected volatility are OUTPUTS of the model, instead of inputs for Black Scholes.  This feature makes lattice models able to value American options and options on new companies (without significant operating history).

Other models include iterative simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo.  This approach is similar to the Black Scholes model in that you input probability distributions and expected values for your value drivers.  The difference comes in the output, which is discrete as opposed to the continuous Black Scholes.  I know this stuff is technical, but if you are interested, there is a ton of research on all of these models.  Have fun.</td>

If you buy one share of the company, you own 1% of the company. At the annual shareholder's meeting, you may cast your vote on certain measures (such as election of the board of directors or some other such thing).

The stock market is a market where these shares are bought and sold. The market price is determined by the opinions of the people trying to sell and the people trying to buy. They make these determinations based upon how much money the company is making, how much debt the company has, and other factors. People who are buying offer a price (you'll see that listed in a stock quote as the 'bid'), and people who are selling offer a price (you'll see that listed as the 'ask'). When these two prices meet, a sale is made.

<td>Can someone explain discount and yield in reference to Treasury bills (T-bills)?</td>
<td>The yield is the interest rate that the T-Bill pays.

Treasury bills are sold at a discount. The difference between the auction sales price and the value of the T-bill at maturity represents the income from the T-bill. Yields on T-bills are calculated using the bank discount method, as shown below:

Discount Rate = (Par Value - Purchase Price)/ Par Value multiplied by 360/days / Number of days to maturity 

Because the bank discount method does not account for compounding of interest or the actual number of days in a year (365 or 366), the calculated T-bill discount rate always is lower than the investment yield on a T-bill. You may account for this understatement of the return by converting the discount rate to an investment yield (or coupon-equivalent yield). After making that conversion you may make comparisons with yields on other types of instruments. The following formula converts a discount rate to an investment yield:

Investment Yield = _________365 x Discount Rate______ 
 360 ? (Discount Rate x Days to maturity) 

 Does that make any sense? If a $10,000 bill is selling for $9,800, then you get a $200 discount. If the yield (interest rate) is 1.5%, you get the par value of the bill at maturity ($10,000) plus the $200 from buying it at a discount (market value), plus you keep any interest that is paid during the holding period. So the actual yield is higher thanthe stated amount of 1.5% when you buy it at a discount.</td>

<td>Investing in Silver Bullion?</td>
<td>If I took one of my bars in to a coin shop to sell, and they wanted to drill in hole in my J/M serialized bar - I would give them a piece of my mind (loudly) and leave!

you should have NO problem selling them as long as they are a known refiner / assayer.

As far as the fees - thats a different matter.  I have only bought from a coin store, never sold to them.  Always sell to individuals - as they should atleast pay spot price (if price is in down trend) or more then spot if price is in uptrend.  I doubt a coin shop will pay over spot price, as they can get it AT spot price or just a tiny bit over, and thats thier worst case scenario.

And along the same lines.  SHOP AROUND - can't stress that enough.  I found that coin shops in my area had very noticable price differences for the same thing - call each coin shop one morning, and ask for the price of a 10oz .999 silver bar.  Go visit the lowest 3 or 4 prices you get - (visit with empty pockets) just a get the feel of the place and see if you like who you'll be giving your money too.

I should also say (since you asked), take it with you!  DO NOT pay for storage - its no good if you can't get to it when/if you need it.  Also, any fees over time will eat up some profit you will make if the price goes up, and it will add to the lose if the price goes down.

If its just an investment, buy in on a physical 'pool', like at kitco.com. Its about 1/3 the way down on this page:
https://online.kitco.com/sellprice/selling.html  
I only mention this as an option.  Personally, I would suggest getting physical if your interested in it.

Last but not least - If you do decide to purchase some silver from a local coin shop - PAY IN CASH!!  No credit cards, no debit cards, no checks, no names, no nothing - just pay, say thanks and leave. 

Good luck!

"Nobody buys the actual metal as an investment anymore."
Nobody???  really???  Check E-bay - find a .999 silver "anything" that sells for less then spot price.  1000's of oz.'s per week are sold on E-bay at what I consider high prices, especially when you take shipping into consideration.</td>

<td>How can I best grow my money?</td>
<td>To best grow your money you first need to establish the amount of risk your willing to take. Low risk, get into bonds or money market accounts and expect about 5-6% annually. Mutual funds will offer the full range from 5-20% on average, but the more gain means the more lost. For the most aggressive risk (and therefore gain) play in individual stocks, options or on forex (foreign exchange currency market).

The most important thing is to spread your money around, don't lump all your capital into one or two stocks, because your setting yourself up to take major losses. Educate yourself before jumping into anything. Investopedia.com is a good resource for that - just remember that they are supported by various brokers and agencies, so take recommendations lightly.

<td>to what extend can provision for depreciation be considered a source of funds?</td>
<td>Depreciation is a non-cash expense used to match asset utilization the the revenues those assets help generate.  The depreciation expense in and of itself does not contribute to cash, but the tax shield you get from having depreciation does create a source of funds.  For financial accounting, you have straight line, double declining balance, sum of years, etc...take the depreciation expense in any given year and multiply it by the tax rate in that year to get your depreciation tax shield (that is the amount of taxes you did not have to pay due to depreciation being there).  When you put your cash flow statement together, depreciation and all non-cash items are added back to net income in the Operating Cash Flow section.

For tax accounting, you have an accelerated method called MACRS.  Taking the depreciation percent from the MACRS table, multiplying the asset's book value by that percent yields your tax-based depreciation.  Multiplying this number by your tax rate will give you actual cash savings on your tax returns.  

Important to note that tax savings for financial statements and tax returns may be different.  Remember, the tax return data shows ACTUAL cash, so that will be the number you are most interested in.  The discrepency between financial statements and tax returns will be made up in deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.</td>

<td>Anyone have advice on opening a Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA?</td>
<td>Roth IRAs and Traditional IRAs both have variations depending on who you open your IRA with and how much of a risk you want to take with you investment.  There are many investment/portfolio types available for both.  Neither is better than the other in that respect.

The difference is how the money you put in and take out is taxed.  Money put into a Roth IRA is taxed before it goes in.  That means that it and all of the interest it gains will not be taxed when you withdraw it down the road.  Standard IRA contributions are not taxed initially, but when you withdraw the funds.  This means that the money you put in the interest it gains is also taxed at withdrawal.  It is a little complicated, but I've seen the numbers, and with the same amount invested Roth pays off more in the long run.  Talk to a professional.  You don't have to commit to one or the other for asking a question or two.

Another thing about Roth IRAs is that you can move money from other IRA/Retirement plans into it without paying a withdrawal penalty.  For example, I can move money from my Standard IRA account over to my Roth IRA without paying for pulling funds from my Standard IRA before my eligibility date.

<td>What are "Restricted Rule 144 shares" of stock, and what are the benefits and liabilities of having them?</td>
<td>Rule 144: Selling Restricted and Control Securities

When you acquire restricted securities or hold control securities, you must find an exemption from the SEC's registration requirements to sell them in the marketplace. Rule 144 allows public resale of restricted and control securities if a number of conditions are met. This overview tells you what you need to know about selling your restricted or control securities. It also describes how to have a restrictive legend removed.
What Are Restricted and Control Securities?

Restricted securities are securities acquired in unregistered, private sales from the issuer or from an affiliate of the issuer. Investors typically receive restricted securities through private placement offerings, Regulation D offerings, employee stock benefit plans, as compensation for professional services, or in exchange for providing "seed money" or start-up capital to the company. Rule 144(a)(3) identifies what sales produce restricted securities.

Control securities are those held by an affiliate of the issuing company. An affiliate is a person, such as a director or large shareholder, in a relationship of control with the issuer. Control means the power to direct the management and policies of the company in question, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. If you buy securities from a controlling person or "affiliate," you take restricted securities, even if they were not restricted in the affiliate's hands.

If you acquire restricted securities, you almost always will receive a certificate stamped with a "restricted" legend. The legend indicates that the securities may not be resold in the marketplace unless they are registered with the SEC or are exempt from the registration requirements. The certificates of control securities are usually not stamped with a legend.</td>

<td>What is Asset/Liability modelling?</td>
<td>This question can have a number of answers, depending upon which context it refers to.  

For example, imagine a life insurance company receives premiums on a regular and predictable basis.  They invest most of this money in the equity market.  Then they have to pay out money on life insurance policies as people die.

How much will they have to pay out?  Well, it depends upon your assumptions.  If you assume that people will more or less live as long as they usually have in the past, then you can use tables of numbers that let you estimate how much money will probably need to be paid out over time.  this is an estimate and cannot be certain, and so some assumptions and mathematical models are used.  Hence the word "modelling".

The money they have to pay out is their "liability".

Their assets are whatever they bought with the premiums they received, as in stock.  Will the stock market grow enough so that stock can be sold to pay out on the life policies? That depends on  how you model the returns of the stock market.

In the past, actuaries assumed that stocks will make as much money as they usually have in the last 20 years or so.  Unfortunately they may be wrong.  Another model that is safer to use is that of "risk neutral valuation" which is a model used in option pricing.  it is also the model used by banks to value their assets and liabilities.

<td>How do you INVEST???</td>
<td>Investing is a complicated subject. First I'll recommend a great book. "Rich Dad Poor Dad" It is an easy read and full of fantastic information. There are several routes you can use to begin investing. You can join a brokerage house. Some of the include A.G. Edwards, T.D. Waterhouse and there are many others. You can find many in a simple on line search. The benefit of these establishment is that you get advice from a person who has worked in the field for a long time. They know how the stock market works. It's great that you want to begin investing now. The time value of money is on your side.
The downside to investing with a major brokerage is that they will charge you a transaction fee each time you buy or sell a set of stocks. So you would have to make enough money to cover your opening bid and then enough to cover the sale of the stocks as well.
This is what I do because I am still relatively young also. I plan on my investments being long term, so this path is right for me.

But if you want to get into the game in a big way you can try trading with an on line brokerage account. Something like e-trade, Scott trade, share-builder and others. These also have fees associated with trading sets of stocks, however the fee would be much smaller than the big brokerage houses. But in order to create an account you will have to have a principal of 500 to 1000 dollars. take into consideration that you will not get any advice from these companies beyond some sort of business news ticker.

The principal behind the stock market is 'buy low sell high'. Stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ will have information including the stocks year long or 52 week high and low. look for a stock that is near it's 52 week low but is a good company with Strong management. Like gambling their is risk involved in trading stocks. The riskier the more potential for a great return (15%+). The more safe the lower the return (3%-14%).
You have to be willing to take some risk because even mutual funds are not a sure thing. Watch some of your favorite companies stocks on http://finance.yahoo.com . See how the move up and down. Invest with pretend money and see how you would have done. Get some experience and then go for it with some real money.</td>

You can buy books that will clearly explain "asset allocation". Morningstar is a good place to do your "hunt" for the right fund.

If you're just starting &amp; just want a "broad" investment into the market.... Go for a "total US market" or "S&amp;P500" index fund (expense ratio less than .0020).

Your best bet to do "right by you" is to learn. If you don't understand investing (and what you're investing in).... you're bound to make some costly errors.

<td>Nothing could be more simple. First you open an account with a brokerage firm. On line brokers charge very reasonable commissions. You normally have to make a deposit of at least $500. But in my oppinion that is not really enough to begin with. You can purchase stocks on margin, which means you only have to fund 50% of the purchase price and the brokerage firm will lend you the rest, at an interest rate of course. 

Next, you pick out a stock you want to buy or sell. You can do either. If you do not own the stock, selling it is called short selling. That means that eventually, you will have to buy it back. You then make your trade and wait for the price to go up or down. At some future time, maybe a few minutes, maybe a few hours, maybe a few days, or weeks, or months, or years, you will decide to sell the stock or repurchase your short position at either a gain or a loss. 

It is that simple. If you hold the stock for at least a year and you have a gain, you will be taxed at a rate of about 1/2 the normal tax rate. On short sales, gains for some odd reason are always taxed at the full rate.</td>

<td>buying self storage?</td>
<td>I suggest you first start by doing a research on the business, the costs and investments it entails, the market for storage in your planned location, legal requirements, and operational characteristics. 

One website I highly recommend is Self Storage Association at http://www.selfstorage.org . They have produced several must-read publications on the self storage industry that any would-be entrant in this field should read. These studies include Financial &amp; Operational Characteristics of Self Storage Facilities; Self Storage Demand Study; The Best of The Self Storage Legal Network: Answers to the 75 Most Frequently Asked Legal Questions; among others. The prices of the publication may be a bit steep but it is always better to know more about the market before you enter it, especially for a business that will require significant initial outlay. 

You may also want to check out the following books: 

"How to Invest in Self-Storage" by Scott Duffy; RK Kliebenstein 
"Market Analysis and Valuation of Self-Storage Facilities" by Richard R. Correll 

Here are some resources where you can get more information on how to start a storage business, including a link to a sample business plan that you can study and even adapt, as well as an overview of the self storage business from a subsidiary of SBA:

<td>How do I get started with buying stock?  I only want to start out with a small amount of money.?</td>
<td>The best way to do anything yourself is to learn something about it first. You'd be surprised at the thousands of books available on this one subject at your local library.

But most people spend more time deciding the color of their new car, than they do on a mutual fund advisor, for example. 

Are you really wanting to do this yourself, or are you asking about someone who is an expert who can do it for you?

If you invest in the stock market right now, or just buy into all the ETF's you can afford, it's a crap shoot, like rolling the dice, and the odds are probably not in your favor, whether you have an expert fund manager or not, because mutual funds are always "in" the market.

They say "Buy and Hold" for the long term is better, but that depends on when you get in, and what your definiton of "long term" is. 

The Dow is now approaching all-time highs last seen in Jan 2000, so if your long-term definition is more than seven years, then you won't mind waiting another seven years for a profit.

In my opinion, the name of the game is capital preservation. When the risks are high, like right now, you get out of the stock and bond markets and park your cash in a interest bearing money market fund or CD or Treasury Bill.

This is simply not a good entry point for investors. Be patient, wait a few months, and you'll be able to buy much more stock a lot cheaper, the risks will be lower (even though they will seem higher), and your chance of success greater.

If you wish to research the “Buy and Hold Strategy” further, or perhaps trade yourself, I recommend two book titles. One is called "Which Is Better, Buy-and-Hold or Market Timing?" The other is "Do You Have What It Takes to Be a Market Timer?" They will give you plenty to think about.</td>

<td>is it okay to buy EE bonds worth 20000 dollars for 10000 dollars?</td>
<td>Savings bonds are designed mainly for longer-term savings.  If that's what you're after, they could be a good choice.  The benefits are safety--they're guaranteed by the government--and tax deferral--you don't have to pay federal tax on the interest until you cash in the bond, and even then you may be able to avoid tax, and they're exempt from state tax.  Also, as you note, you can get into savings bonds with very little money and they're convenient to buy at any bank without commission.  The downside is that the returns are modest.

Savings bonds are sold at denominations of 1/2 their face value.  In fact, you can sort of ingore their face value altogether because you can cash them in at any time--you don't have to wait until they "mature"--and they earn interest for 30 years, regardless of when they reach their face value.</td>

<td>How to manage your own portfolio online without allowing brokerage fees to take too much of your money?</td>
<td>It sounds like you have a good handle on the issues that you will confront.  Modern portfolio theory says that you optimize your portfolio where you have maximum returns given the risk of the investments.  Remember that the market only rewards you for market risk and not individual firm risk, so diversification, like you are looking for, is the way to go.  Unfortunately, there are some studies that show that you begin to approach market risk in your portfolio once you have bought between 30 and 50 stocks.  In addition to the brokerage costs, the time that you would spend actively maintaining a portolio to be truly diversified would amount to a full time job (not to mention the headache of doing your taxes with all the gains and losses).  Mutual funds offer some of the benefits of diversification, but will cost you if you are not careful in selecting based on load and management costs.  Over the long term, very very few portfolio managers continually beat the market, and the ones that do charge a premium for their services (look at Warren Buffet of Berkshire Hathaway) which erodes your gains.  Typically, the easiest and cheapest way to diversify it to buy index funds.  Since these fundes are constructed and maintained by a computer to mirror the risk of the market, the idea is that you receive what the market returns over the long term.  An additional benefit of these funds is that you do not need to worry about management tenure, turnover within the fund, or any of the other considerations normally associated with actively managed funds.  Hope this helps.</td>

Another buyer may be a retirement fund that has to buy stock because more money has been injected into the fund.  One seller may be concerned about a recent news announcement.

If you're sole goal is to preserve ownership %, then the best route is to try and raise cash via friends and family at first.

Once that is exhausted try for angel capital but really limit the amount of money to what you absolutely need to purchase.

After both of those have been exhausted approach the VC's for more significant investments, but hopefully you'll be farther along in the product development and the risk is lower to the VC because you have more tangible product, and therefore you have more leverage than you would have sans product.

There is no formula that can be applied here, it's really more about managing risk and having leverage when negotiating. Not to mention the strength of the idea and the timing and motivation for VC's to adopt the risk. If this is a hot idea in and up and coming area and you have a solid team behind you then it's easy, but if you're entering a market that is already well defined and is not attractive to the VC then it's harder.</td>

<td>What is derivatives? Pls show me by example.?</td>
<td>I assume you kinow about a share (listed on stock exchanges) and how trading takes place. Derivatives are nothing but trading instruments derived from that share - called underlying. Derivative has something called strike price. Let us assume a share is quoted at US$ 40 (let the face value be anything say US$1)and the strike prices may be US $ 30, 35, 40 ,45 and so on. When the current market price is at US$ 40 and you are bullish on the stock and you hope that price will move up to say US $ 50, you can buy Call option with a strike price of say US $ 50. For this you have to pay option premium, which depends on tenor of the Call Option instrument - 1, 2 or 3 months. In this example let us assume that you hope the price movement to take place in 2 to 3 months and therefore you buy US$ 50 - strike price- which has 3 months expiry. When the price moves towards US$ 50, your Call option US$ 50 strike price starts moving and the call option price movement can be even 200% or more. These derivatives mormally has a lot size - say 2000 in this case. So if you had bought the 50 strike price call option for say US $ 3 it is possible that you may get say US $ 6. And your profit is 2000 x (6 - 3)= US $ 6000. Suppose if you had invested same money (2000 x3) 6000 in the share you would have bought only 150 shares (6000 / 40)and even if you sell at US $ 50 per share your profit is limited to US$ 1500. If you are bearish that the stock would come down to US $ 30, then you should buy Put option with a strike price of US $ 30 and when the stock moves down you make the same money as you made in call option. If your expectation does not work out, then there is danger of losing your money paid as premium. 

There are also stock futures - where the risk is quite high. Unlike Options, Futures has unlimited profit / loss potential.

Derivatives are indeed a very intersting field and with right strategies one can mint money. Good luck</td>

<td>Is it better to put money into a 401(k) or a Roth IRA?</td>
<td>The answer depends on your current financial situation.  In order to decide which is best, you must look at the advantages/disadvantages of both.  

A 401K plan allows you to contribute a portion of your income to a retirement investment plan.  This is usually the plan of choice for employers who will match a percentage of your contribution.  

A Roth IRA differs from a the 401k in that the taxes are paid on the funds you contribute WHEN YOU CONTRIBUTE THEM.  A 401k allows you to contribute to your retirement and receive the tax break immediately.  

That being said, if you plan to have a rather high income when retired it might be better to contribute to a Roth IRA in order to minimize your tax liability.  

If you plan to have a modest retirement income (the rule of thumb is usually 70% of what you make when you're 40 yrs. old) and you have a higher paying job, you may want to consider a 401k.  

You should also consider what the employer contributes.  If your employer matches your contribution to a 401k but not a Roth IRA, you may want to take the tax hit later and stick with the 401k.  Your goal is to maximize retirement funds and minimize tax liability.  In order to do that you need to develop a plan for your future.  The website I posted below may help you.  Best of luck with your financial planning!</td>

<td>Just as a warrior exercises and practise before he goes to war, just as a poet rewrites and rewrites before he is satisfied, you need to go the distance in making money as well. The only way to get rich, is through owning a business. 

The best business training available is through network or multi level marketing. Be on the look-out for the system with the best training, not necessarily the best products. (However, sometimes they go together) 

Be careful of pyramid schemes though - they often masquearade as multi-level marketing schemes. Look out for monthly contributions for "membership" or too large upfront fees.</td>

Welcome to the investment world.
Since you do not have a prior experiance of investment then forget about managing your own portfolio. Choose to invest in any mutual funds.  One thing you have to keep in mind is the higher the return on the fund, the riskier it is. so whats your risk level?
Some mutual fund are made for capital gain and some for dividends(income)... so which one do you prefere?

You might want a fund that is focused on hot secters like: oil, gas, biotech, hightech... the future is looking good for these sectors. 
I have put my money with Fidelity, TD waterhouse(canada).. in a very risky aggressive funds and they showed handsome returns...

hope this will help..!

<td>i need 401k help!! I know nothing about them and I have a new one and dont know what Im doing with it.?</td>
<td>Suzanne,

Lets take it from the basics. As you have already been told by many. The 401k varies per company policy. But most companies match 4% of the money you invest. So at minimum you want to invest the same percentage of your salary the company matches. Reason being the company will be matching 100% of your investment. 
Now the 401k will consist of different funds such as stock, mutual, commodoties, fixed income, etc ... You upon enrollment will have to decide how you want to allocate your 4%(persay) of your salary amongst each fund. So lets say you invest 4% = 200$(of your salary), you would have to allocate 100% of the 200$ plus the company match into the funds. For example 10% fundA, 10% fundb, 80% fundc. 
Prior to investing in any fund do some research, each 401k plan will have history relating to each funds performance since it was created. Look for the best performers and choose wisely. Wisely meaning how aggressive or passive you want to invest. Each method involving Risk, Risk meaning your can earn alot and lose alot in short or long periods of time invested.
Your 401k plan will have historical investments plans already in place for you to follow if it fits your lifestyle.
Lifestyle, now this is the most important detail for you to think about. As you know from what we talked about you can invest the minimum or the maximum. Maximum being I think 15% or 13,000$ per year of salary. (Inquire, I am just taking a guess here)But anyways, depending on how much your salary is a year your investment can change your lifestyle tremendously. But by matching the minimum your making 100% of your investment with company match. Anything more than that and your saving without company match, but making more  on your investment than if you would put that money into a savings bank account for the long term. 
With that in mind I would suggest you and your family if any sit down with a financial planner to give you other options on how to save your excess money (if you have more to invest over the company match) amongst other options such as IRAs, CDs, etc... This taking into account after you have agreed upon what kind of lifestyle you want to live.   
The final outlook is this ... Your company is giving you free money for savings in the future. FREE MONEY. Nothing beats that unless you win the lottery.
Good luck...</td>

Your risk tolerance should dictate what type of investments.  If you have an average or low risk appetite, try mutual funds that specialize in precious metals and energy.  Even real estate.

If you are ok with risk, stocks will give you better returns if you pick right of course.  Try stocks like VLI, PCU if you're after growth AND dividends.  Others like MMM or JPM if your after long term growth.

<td>Winners Demonstrate Investment Excellence and Stewardship in a Year of Mixed
                                   Results

    CHICAGO, Jan. 4 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- In a year when international-
stock funds soared, bond funds struggled, and domestic-stock funds fell
somewhere in the middle, the best fund managers demonstrated that even when
the markets are mixed, superb analysis, long-term focus, and outstanding
stewardship make a difference.
    To recognize the best fund managers, Morningstar, Inc., a leading provider
of independent investment research, each year selects leaders in three
categories -- domestic stock, international stock, and fixed income. Today,
Morningstar announced its 2005 Fund Manager of the Year award winners:

     -- Domestic-Stock Fund Manager of the Year:
        Christopher Davis and Ken Charles Feinberg
        Selected American Shares (SLASX)
        Davis NY Venture A (NYVTX)

     -- International-Stock Fund Manager of the Year:
        Robert Lyon, Matthew Pickering and Jerrold Senser
        ICAP International (ICEUX)

     -- Fixed-Income Fund Manager of the Year:
        Tad Rivelle, Laird Landmann, Stephen Kane, and David Lippman
        Metropolitan West Total Return Bond (MWTRX)

    "This year's winners are longtime Morningstar favorites. We've recommended
these managers for years, and they have long been on the Morningstar Analyst
Picks list," said Kunal Kapoor, director of mutual fund analysis for
Morningstar. "The managers at Davis Selected Advisers, ICAP and Metropolitan
West stand out for their attention to fees, investing in the funds they
oversee and their respect for shareholders with all-around strong
stewardship."

    Domestic-Stock Fund Manager of the Year:
    Christopher Davis and Ken Charles Feinberg
    Selected American Shares (SLASX)
    Davis NY Venture A (NYVTX)

    Chris Davis and Ken Feinberg maintain a tight focus on producing good
long-term results for shareholders. They seldom trade, take heed of
transaction costs and taxes, maintain low expenses and avoid short-term bets.
Even though interest rates rose steadily in 2005, this team's superb stock-
picking ability helped their financials-heavy portfolio buck conventional
wisdom and trump the S&amp;P 500 Index by 5 percent.
    In 2004, Davis Selected Advisers demonstrated its strengths as a steward
of shareholders' capital by instituting a less expensive, directly sold share
class (D class) for Selected American, which resulted in a sizable fee cut for
those who invest through the firm, rather than with a supermarket.
    In 2005, the team at Davis Selected Advisers set a higher standard for
stewardship. After being named as the management team to oversee the Clipper
Fund, the employees at Selected Advisers immediately invested $50 million of
their money into the fund, and they offered Clipper's shareholders a nearly 50
percent cut in management fees.
    "This firm sets the bar for others in the industry," Kapoor said. "At a
time when other firms don't always do what is best for their shareholders,
it's refreshing to see a firm so committed to the long-term welfare of
fundholders. Davis and Feinberg were runners-up for our 2004 Domestic-Stock
Fund Manager of the Year, and they deserve this year's award. They follow in
the footsteps of Shelby Davis, Chris' dad, who won the Domestic-Stock Fund
Manager of the Year award in 1996."

    International-Stock Fund Manager of the Year:
    Robert Lyon, Matthew Pickering and Jerrold Senser
    ICAP International (ICEUX)

    In May 2005, the ICAP International Fund team, led by Rob Lyon, converted

<td>what is coking coal used for.?</td>
<td>Coke is a solid carbonaceous residue derived from low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal. The volatile constituents of the coal (including water, coal-gas and coal-tar) are driven off by baking in an airless oven at temperatures as high as 1,000 degrees Celsius so that the fixed carbon and residual ash are fused together.
Properties &amp; usage
Coke typically has a specific gravity in the range 1.85 - 1.9. It is highly porous, and a mass of coke has 40% greater volume than the equivalent mass of coal.

Since the smoke-producing constituents are driven off during the coking of the coal, coke forms a desirable fuel for stoves and furnaces in which conditions are not suitable for the complete burning of bituminous coal itself. Coke may be burned with little or no smoke under combustion conditions which would result in a large amount of smoke if bituminous coal were the fuel.

Bituminous coal must meet a set of criteria for use as coking coal, determined by particular coal assay techniques. These include moisture content, ash content, sulphur content, volatilte content, tar and plasticity.

Coke is used as a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace. Coke from coal is grey, hard, and porous and has a heating value of 28 megajoules/kilogram.
History
The use of coke as a fuel was pioneered in 17th century England in response to the ever-growing problem of European deforestation. Wood was becoming increasingly scarce and expensive, and coal's fumes, particularly smoke and sulfur compounds, disqualified it from many applications, including cooking and iron smelting. In 1603, Sir Henry Platt suggested that coal might be charred in a manner analogous to the way charcoal is produced from wood. This process was not put into practice, however, until 1642, when coke was used for roasting malt in Derbyshire. (Coal could not be used in brewing, because its sulfurous fumes would impart a foul taste to the resulting beer.) Perhaps more significantly, in 1709, Abraham Darby set up a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron. The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the European industrial revolution.</td>

<td>Shares of stock represent portions of the company, so if the company does well, then normally the stock price goes up because the company is more value in total so each part is more valuable.

Common shares are what's normally traded and what you're probably more familiar with.  Preferred is basically debt in a different form.  The dividends are relatively high and similar to the coupon payments for bonds, and preferred shares don't move as much to account for the usually higher dividends.</td>

<td>how much shud a starter invest in mutual funds and how safe they are?</td>
<td>Safe... It depends on you're goals, time horizon &amp; the stated goals of the mutual fund.  The S&amp;P500 Index (the benchmark for many mutual funds) can go down 25% or more at a clip.  But, over the long term this type of "unmanaged" fund beats 80% of all mutual funds (over 10 years and more).

First bottom line;
NEVER (ever) INVEST IN SOMETHING YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
Know why you're investing in something. Know exactly what the risk is.  I've gone through periods where some of my funds have gone down more than 30%.  This was to be expected &amp; time has made that 30% loss disappear into a nice profit.

Read some books. Learn (&amp; understand) terms like;
Asset Allocation
Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap &amp; International.
Growth &amp; Value

Take your time to learn. I've done very well for myself &amp; family by prudent investing (with understanding).....

Don't go into a stock mutual fund unless your "time horizon" is over five years.

Do not call or follow any leads to a broker or mutual fund company found through postings on this forum (unless you already know through other research they're legit).

Good luck!</td>

<td>What is the difference between shorting a stock and selling a call to open?</td>
<td>Shorting a stock is a process by which shares are borrowed then sold. These shares must be bought back at an undetrmined future date. The intent in doing this is to buy the shares at a price below where they were sold. If the market for this stock rises, a person may be forced to buy back at a higher price. In such a case a loss would be incurred. 

Selling a call to open is essentially granting another person the right to "call away" or take a specified quantity of shares from you at a predetermined price. This price is known as the strike price. The objective of the seller (the person who is selling the call to open) is to capture the premium ( the amount that the buyer pays to secure the right to call away stock). The seller hopes that either the stock never reaches the strike price or that if it does the premium received exceeds the loss resulting from the stock rising above the strike price.

In selling short, the profit potential is the differece between where the stock was sold short and 0. In contrast, the profit potential for selling calls to open is the premium and no more. 

In both instances, the potential loss is theoretically unlimited. As a shortseller  you are responsible for covering the price movement from  the point at which the stock was sold short to infinity . As a call writer, you are responsible for covering all price movement from the strike price  to infinity.

Oftentimes people will write "covered" calls which means a person owns the stock for which the call is written. In such a case if the value of the stock rises, the stock is called away and the call buyer pays the strike price to the seller. 

For example, a person buys 100 shares of XYZ stock at 20 dollars. He writes a call with a stike price of 22.50 and receives a premium of .50 . Subsequently the stock rises to 40 dollars. In such a case the stock would be called away at 22.50. The seller would receive the premium of .50 in addition to being paid 22.50 per share for his stock. 

If the stock price dropped to say 17 dollars, the seller of the call would receive a premium of .50 and would still own the stock at 17.50.</td>

<td>1. Buy stocks before they increase in value (going long).
2. Sell stocks before they decrease in value (going short).  Note that it is possible to sell a stock without actually owning it, it is called 'short selling.'
3. Buying/ selling options.  An option is a contract that says you have the option to buy (or sell) at a certain price.  
e.g., say you pay $1 to have an option to buy a stock at $10.  The stock later goes up to $12.  You exercise your option, buy the stock at $10, then promptly sell it again at $12.  You've made $1 (12 - 10 - 1) in profit, or a 100% return.  Alternatively if the stock drops below $10, you allow the option to expire and you only lose the $1 you paid to buy the option.
4. You may buy mutual funds, which are pools of stocks, bonds, etc.</td>

<td>what do petty cash means?</td>
<td>Businesses often need small amounts of cash known as petty cash for expenditures where it is not practical to make the disbursement by check.

The most common way of accounting for these expenditures is to use the imprest system. The initial fund would be created by issuing a check for the desired amount. Usually $100 would be sufficient for most small business needs. The entry for this initial fund would be to debit Petty Cash and credit cash.

As expenditures are made the custodian of the fund will reimburse employees and secure a petty cash voucher in return. At any given time the total of cash on hand plus reimbursed vouchers must equal the original fund.

When the fund gets low the custodian submits the vouchers for reimbursement. Assuming the vouchers add up to $80 and that the majority of expenditures were for office supplies, an $80 check is issued and an $80 debit towards office expenses is marked. Once the check is cashed, the custodian has cash at the original amount.

Oversight of petty cash is important because of the potential for abuse. Examples of petty cash controls include a limit (such as 10% of the total fund) on disbursements and monthly audits by someone other than the custodian. Use of petty cash is sufficiently widespread that vouchers for use in reimbursement are available at any office supply store.

While he is building the house, place an ad in your local newspaper saying their new home will be completed in 6 months. Show the buyer the beautiful house plans. Have the buyer pay you by cashiers cheque a down payment of 25%, and the rest on completion. Add 50% to your contractors bill. If contractors final bill is $150,000 sell the house for $225,00. before it is built.
Make sure you build the house on an empty lot owned by someone else so you dont have a paper trail of ownership so you dont pay taxes. You only want cash coming into your possesion.

<td>How can a bond fund lose money when bonds pay interest on the principal?</td>
<td>Bond funds can lose money because the prices of the bonds they hold go up or down every day like all investments.  The factor that most affects bond prices is market interest rates.  As interest rates rise--as they have been doing in the U.S. for over a year--bond prices fall.  And as the prices of bonds fall, the value of shares of mutual fund that own the bonds falls too.

All mutual funds, including bond funds, have to assign values to all their investments at the end of every day and publish the "net asset value" (NAV) for the fund reflecting those values.  If the prices of the bonds they hold go down, they have to lower their published NAV to account for that.  For open-ended funds, the NAV is the price you get or pay when you sell or buy fund shares.</td>

<td>Look at what services they offer. It depends on what you are interested in. You can meet with the people to talk to them without making a long-term commitment. If you want to invest in stocks, make sure they work with stocks and are knowledgeable. If you want to invest in real estate but they only know about the stock market, then they are not the advisers for you. You interests should meet theirs, which means you have to have ideas about you financial plans before meeting them. You shouldn't depend on one company to plan your future for you. You have to be knowledgeable and involved. For someone is just starting, I would go with a company that has TV ads nationally. That means they move millions in revenue and are credible. Meet with reps from the company and talk to them. Find out what they offer for their clients and do your own research.</td>

<td>How high will oil prices go?</td>
<td>Although there's a lot of oil left in the world, and we agree that there's roughly 900 to 1,000 gigabarrels of oil left in the world, you need to put that in context. Up until the Carter years, every decade, we used as much oil as had been used in all of previous history. Now, with exponential growth, if you're at about a 7 percent growth rate, and we were using oil at about 7 percent more per year, the world was, that explains how we got on that curve. Now, the fact that we have about half of all the oil that was ever in the world still there, doesn't mean that the next 50 years, 100 years are going to be like the last 50 years, 100 years, because the world is now demanding a whole lot more oil. Last year, China increased their use probably 25 percent. In less than three years, that doubles their use of oil. They probably won't continue on that growth path, but India's increasing. China's now the No. 2 importer in the world. What are the consequences of this? Boy, economic and geopolitical. When the world recognizes that there's only so much oil that can be produced, and we need more oil -- by the way, if our economy doesn't grow at least 2 percent a year, we can't service our debt. And if we don't think the economy's growing at 2 percent a year, the stock market starts tanking. You know, we have to get used to the fact that there is not going to be oil in the quantities there have been in the past available in the future, and we should have started a long time ago, 'cause we knew -- the world knew -- by at least 1980, that M. King Hubbert was right about our country. If he's right about the United States, why shouldn't he be right about the world? And we should have been doing some things that we've now blown 25 years, that we could have been doing some very meaningful things to prepare for this time when the world reaches its peak ability to produce oil. We didn't do those things then. We really need to start doing them now.</td>

<td>Robert Kiyosaki is not the ultimate authority on investing, nor is Warren Buffet or any of the other idols people like to worship.  You are the ultimate authority, and you need to develop your own investing style.  Read widely before deciding who is right for you.  Probably a composite of different views will make sense.

Having said that, I'd argue for aggressive investing if you can lose some without destroying your chances for college.  Biotech and alternative energy and industries we don't know about yet will have their ups and downs but probably will grow quite a bit in your lifetime.  A fund or some stocks in these fields could multiply several times in 10, 20, 30 years.  And if you lose it all, you'll still have time to raise more money and go more conventional.

If you have some savings and are thinking about investing at 16, you're way ahead of the pack and will no doubt do well one way or another.  Just don't give up over an early mistake--everyone makes them.</td>

<td>What is the return on a Roth IRA and is it the best to invest in?</td>
<td>The return on a Roth IRA depends upon the return of the investments that you've placed inside it.  You put investments in a Roth IRA in order to save for retirement and to avoid taxes.

Most Roth IRA's are invested in mutual funds, and typical returns on these average 9 to 11% in the long run.  You can also use Roth IRA funds to invest in real estate, stocks, bonds, and small businesses.  You are not allowed to invest in collectibles such as art, coins (except gold), or stamps.

A Roth IRA is a very good place to put your money for the tax savings it generates.  If you held the same investment and didn't put it into a Roth IRA, then the government would take 15% of your profits.</td>

<td>How many investment newsletters do I need?</td>
<td>None.  IMHO, you should start by learning how to invest, determining WHAT to buy through Fundamental Analysis and determining WHEN to buy with Technical Analysis. 

IMO, newsletters only make narrow recomendations based on their system of analysis and investment strategies, and often they are compensated heavily for their recomendations and therefore dangerously biased.   I firmly believe that to get a clear picture about any stock, and to determine whether you're actually going to invest in it, it's best to do your own research and adapt a system that meets your investment needs, style and risk level.  There are many stocks ripe for the picking just about at any time if you know how and where to look.

Start with Investors.com, it's William O'Neil's online version of Investors Business Daily.  The How To Invest section is the best place to start learning the importance of Fundamentals and the basics of Technical Analysis.   The site has the IBD 100, a cross index list of the market leaders, the Stock Checkup, a great tool for checking fundamentals on any stock, and articles and analysis of stocks and general market conditions.  They also run various screens every day which in addition to the other lists, (IBD100, New America, stocks under $10, CANSLIM select, ect) are very helpful for finding investment ideas with solid Fundementals that are ready to move.  The CANSLIM method alone is a very successful and popular trading system, but I prefer to use a combination of Fund &amp; Tech Analysis, rather that just the rating system alone.

From there you can move on to more detailed study of Technical Analysis.  

Start with StockCharts.com, they have an excellent free Chart School which helpfully explains various chart patterns and Technical Indicators and overlays.  Pay particular attention to the Chart Patterns section, and make sure you learn about Zig Zag patterns, Bollinger Bands, Moving Average, Volume, RSI, the MACD (Mac-D), The Williams %er, Stochastics, and the Chaikin Money Flow.  Sounds complicated, but when you start chart reading you'll want about a half a dozen or so of these overlays and indicators.  I personally rely heavily on the ZIG-ZAG, MACD, Chaikin Money Flow, Volume, Moving Average and RSI.

StockTA.com is also an excellent Technical Analysis site, with charted Fibonacci resistance and support lines and will tell you if the stock is bullish or bearish in the short, medium and long run.  The site also has an extensive Candle Pattern Glossary and a fantastic technical screener.

The above sites do have premium services, but all the services I mentioned are free.  After you've absorbed some of the Technical information, do some reading on Fibonacci numbers and Elliot Wave theory, there are good links in the "School" section of StockTA.com.  I've been using Elliot Wave and Fibonacci's to help refine my in and out points.  StockCharts.com's "ZigZag" overlay helps me plot and count the waves and that helps determine where I am in the overall pattern.  

So basically I'll find interesting stocks through the screens on Investors.com or StockTA.com, run them through the Stock Checkup at Investors.com, if they measure up I'll run them through the Analyisis &amp; Fib Analysis at StockTA.com and do an extensive chart study, examining the 2 yr, 1 yr, 6 mth, 3 mth, 1 mth &amp; 5 day.  I'll also do my due dilligence, studying the profile, key statistics, headlines, etc. through Yahoo Finance and web searches.  If it all measures up and the stock is in a base or in a pull back and it's starting a wave 1 or wave 3, it's time to buy.

Remember, always protect your downside with a stop loss or a trailing stop loss.  Once you have absorbed a few of the things I've mentioned, the fog will begin to lift and you'll start seeing which stocks should be bought or sold and you'll be able to do your own analysis on any stock, no matter where</td>

<td>First taking your additional question first. Earning money in Foreign currecny and than doing trading. It is perfectly correct and that's the reason NRI Online Share Trading account is for. All this is covered by PIS (Portfolio Investment Scheme) as called by RBI where NRI and OCBs (OVerseas Corporate Bodies) are allowed to do investment in Indian Stock Market through designated banks. ICICI is one of the bank.

*****
Portfolio Investment Scheme (PINS) is a scheme of Reserve Bank of India defined in Schedule 3 of Foreign Exchange Management Act 2000. As per the scheme the NRIs and OCBs can purchase and sell shares and convertible debentures of Indian Companies on a recognised stock exchange by routing such purchase/sale transactions through their account with a Designated Bank Branch. (With effect from 29/11/2001 RBI has restricted OCBs from making fresh purchases. They can however continue their existing holdings or sell off the same).
*****

Regarding trading from US - From Indian law there is no restrictions however I have certainly remember reading somewhere on some banks site where they have written except NRI in US. Do not remember whether it was ICICI Bank or some one else and what is correct reason for that. May be that is more to do with that particular bank since they may have some issue of registration or following US laws for offering services.

<td>What is Mutual Fund? How many types are there?</td>
<td>Mutual fund schemes may be classified on the basis of its structure and its investment objective. 

By Structure: 

Open-ended Funds An open-end fund is one that is available for subscription all through the year. These do not have a fixed maturity. Investors can conveniently buy and sell units at Net Asset Value ("NAV") related prices. The key feature of open-end schemes is liquidity.

Closed-ended Funds A closed-end fund has a stipulated maturity period which generally ranging from 3 to 15 years. The fund is open for subscription only during a specified period. Investors can invest in the scheme at the time of the initial public issue and thereafter they can buy or sell the units of the scheme on the stock exchanges where they are listed. In order to provide an exit route to the investors, some close-ended funds give an option of selling back the units to the Mutual Fund through periodic repurchase at NAV related prices. SEBI Regulations stipulate that at least one of the two exit routes is provided to the investor.

Interval Funds Interval funds combine the features of open-ended and close-ended schemes. They are open for sale or redemption during pre-determined intervals at NAV related prices.

By Investment Objective:

Growth Funds The aim of growth funds is to provide capital appreciation over the medium to long- term. Such schemes normally invest a majority of their corpus in equities. It has been proven that returns from stocks, have outperformed most other kind of investments held over the long term. Growth schemes are ideal for investors having a long-term outlook seeking growth over a period of time.

Income Funds The aim of income funds is to provide regular and steady income to investors. Such schemes generally invest in fixed income securities such as bonds, corporate debentures and Government securities. Income Funds are ideal for capital stability and regular income.

Balanced Funds The aim of balanced funds is to provide both growth and regular income. Such schemes periodically distribute a part of their earning and invest both in equities and fixed income securities in the proportion indicated in their offer documents. In a rising stock market, the NAV of these schemes may not normally keep pace, or fall equally when the market falls. These are ideal for investors looking for a combination of income and moderate growth.

Money Market Funds The aim of money market funds is to provide easy liquidity, preservation of capital and moderate income. These schemes generally invest in safer short-term instruments such as treasury bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and inter-bank call money. Returns on these schemes may fluctuate depending upon the interest rates prevailing in the market. These are ideal for Corporate and individual investors as a means to park their surplus funds for short periods.

Load Funds A Load Fund is one that charges a commission for entry or exit. That is, each time you buy or sell units in the fund, a commission will be payable. Typically entry and exit loads range from 1% to 2%. It could be worth paying the load, if the fund has a good performance history.

No-Load Funds A No-Load Fund is one that does not charge a commission for entry or exit. That is, no commission is payable on purchase or sale of units in the fund. The advantage of a no load fund is that the entire corpus is put to work.

Other Schemes: 

Tax Saving Schemes These schemes offer tax rebates to the investors under specific provisions of the Indian Income Tax laws as the Government offers tax incentives for investment in specified avenues. Investments made in Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS) and Pension Schemes are allowed as deduction u/s 88 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The Act also provides opportunities to investors to save capital gains u/s 54EA and 54EB by investing in Mutual Funds, provided the capital asset has been sold prior to April 1, 2000 and the amount is in</td>

<td>stock related question- whats does MA50 and MA200 mean?</td>
<td>The 50 day and 200 day moving averages are lagging charts that generally follow (up and down) a stock's price.  If a stock falls through the 50 day moving average, this is a pessimistic sign.  If the stock price also falls through the 200, it is a sure sign that the stock will not soon recover its price.

Just like moving through these two lines can indicate bad news, it can indicate good news.  When the daily price chart crosses over the 50 day moving average (above the MA) this is very good behavior.  If it then later moves above the 200 MA, it generally means that the stock is in a long term period of gain.

Go to finance.yahoo.com and select the stock GOOG (Google) and when you chart this stock, the chart page allows you to choose "Technical Analysis".  Then you can plot the stock price vs. the 50 and 200 Moving Averages (even both at once.)  Google looks great against those two plots!</td>

Still, plenty of times, many of my orders have not been filled at the limit price. It is the worse believe me. Yes, you can make a market in some illiquid stocks, making your bid appear a couple of cents above the current one. Unless you are a day trader, no need to worry about it too much. 

C) When you make a market order, your buy (sell) will execute at the ask(bid) avalaible at the moment, you will get the stock at the price show on your quote. In fast moving markets, you will get different fills.

Since, you are asking this questions go with limit or market orders whatever you feel comfortable and try not to day-trade. Be careful.</td>

<td>Could you please explain the concept of Securitisation and SPV(Special-purpose vehicle)?</td>
<td>Securitization is the process of packaging similar financial instruments (like mortgages to individuals) into a new security (like a mortgage-backed security). For a bank to securitize an asset (like a mortgage loan to a consumer) the bank needs to acquire the asset (make the loan), classify the asset (by risk score), collateralize (make sure it's secured), pool (combine it with other mortgages) and distribute (sell the mortgage-backed security to investors). 

A Special Purpose Vehicle is the conduit or legal vehicle  formed to hold receivables transferred by the originator on behalf of the investors. The SPV represents the collective property and cashflows of the investors. 

Securitization is a tricky topic but if you're into finance it is one of the most critical topics to understand.

<td>In current scenario which Mutual Fund (diversified) is most attractive and stable for 1 to 5 years.?</td>
<td>The best way to do anything yourself is to learn something about it first. You'd be surprised at the thousands of books available on this one subject at your local library.

But most people spend more time deciding the color of their new car, than they do on a mutual fund advisor, for example. 

Are you really wanting to do this yourself, or are you asking about someone who is an expert who can do it for you?

If you invest in the stock market right now, or just buy into all the ETF's you can afford, it's a crap shoot, like rolling the dice, and the odds are probably not in your favor, whether you have an expert fund manager or not, because mutual funds are always "in" the market.

They say "Buy and Hold" for the long term is better, but that depends on when you get in, and what your definiton of "long term" is. 

The Dow is now approaching all-time highs last seen in Jan 2000, so if your long-term definition is more than seven years, then you won't mind waiting another seven years for a profit.

In my opinion, the name of the game is capital preservation. When the risks are high, like right now, you get out of the stock and bond markets and park your cash in a interest bearing money market fund or CD or Treasury Bill.

This is simply not a good entry point for investors. Be patient, wait a few months, and you'll be able to buy much more stock a lot cheaper, the risks will be lower (even though they will seem higher), and your chance of success greater.

Eventually, when it is time to get back in the stock market, you can diversify by buying ETF's (Exchange Traded Funds) on the major market indexes, like the Dow or S&amp;P or Nasdaq. A mutual fund is always "in" the market, exposing you to high risk situations like right now. With just a little knowledge, you can do better, and your costs will be less.

If you wish to research the “Buy and Hold Strategy” further, or perhaps trade yourself, I recommend two book titles. One is called "Which Is Better, Buy-and-Hold or Market Timing?" The other is "Do You Have What It Takes to Be a Market Timer?" They will give you plenty to think about.</td>

<td>Can I keep the money in my 403b once I leave Higher Education?</td>
<td>The answer to this question depends on the plan documents that created the plan. Typically an employee can keep accumulated balances in a 403(b)when leaving employment with a qualified employer. However since all the funds are employer contributions you should check the plan document to see what the vesting rules are, if any. Since you say that you have been employed in Higher Ed for a quite some time its likely that you have satisfied any vesting requirements. Your employer can also give you this information.  

Rollovers of 403(b) contributions are usually governed by the plan documents that created the 403(b). It can be difficult to roll the funds over into another qualified 403(b) plan. You cannot roll a 403(b) in an IRA or a Roth IRA.</td>

<td>I want to invest in the stock market but am unsure how to get started?  I need a good book or lead for myself.</td>
<td>Start by learning How to invest, determining WHAT to buy through Fundamental Analysis and determining WHEN to buy through Technical Analysis. 

Start with Investors.com, it's William O'Neil's online version of Investors Business Daily.  The How To Invest section is the best place to start learning the importance of Fundamentals and the basics of Technical Analysis.   The site has the IBD 100, a cross index list of the market leaders, the Stock Checkup, a great tool for checking fundamentals on any stock, and articles and analysis of stocks and general market conditions.  They also run various screens every day which in addition to the other lists, (IBD100, New America, stocks under $10, CANSLIM select, ect) are very helpful for finding investment ideas with solid Fundamentals that are ready to move.  The CANSLIM method alone is a very successful and popular trading system, but I prefer to use a combination of Fund &amp; Tech Analysis, rather that just the rating system alone. 

From there you can move on to more detailed study of Technical Analysis. 

Start with StockCharts.com, they have an excellent free Chart School which helpfully explains various chart patterns and Technical Indicators and overlays.  Pay particular attention to the Chart Patterns section, and make sure you learn about Zig Zag patterns, Bollinger Bands, Moving Average, Volume, RSI, the MACD (Mac-D), The Williams %er, Stochastics, and the Chaikin Money Flow.  Sounds complicated, but when you start chart reading you'll want about a half a dozen or so of these overlays and indicators.  I personally rely heavily on the ZIG-ZAG, MACD, Chaikin Money Flow, Volume, Moving Average and RSI. 

StockTA.com is also an excellent Technical Analysis site, with charted Fibonacci resistance and support lines and will tell you if the stock is bullish or bearish in the short, medium and long run.  The site also has an extensive Candle Pattern Glossary and a fantastic technical screener. 

The above sites do have premium services, but all the services I mentioned are free.  After you've absorbed some of the Technical information, do some reading on Fibonacci numbers and Elliot Wave theory, there are good links in the "School" section of StockTA.com.  I've been using Elliot Wave and Fibonacci's to help refine my in and out points.  StockCharts.com's "ZigZag" overlay helps me plot and count the waves and that helps determine where I am in the overall pattern. 

The way I personally work is, I'll find interesting stocks through the screens on Investors.com or StockTA.com, run them through the Stock Checkup at Investors.com, if they measure up I'll run them through the Analyisis &amp; Fib Analysis at StockTA.com and do an extensive chart study, examining the 2 yr, 1 yr, 6 mth, 3 mth, 1 mth &amp; 5 day.  I'll also do my due dilligence, studying the profile, key statistics, headlines, etc. through Yahoo Finance and web searches.  If it all measures up and the stock is in a base or in a pull back and it's starting a wave 1 or wave 3, it's time to buy. 

Remember, always protect your downside with a stop loss or a trailing stop loss.  Once you have absorbed a few of the things I've mentioned, the fog will begin to lift and you'll start seeing which stocks should be bought or sold and you'll be able to do your own analysis on any stock. 

If it's all too daunting or confusing, stick with it, it takes time to absorb.  Start by paper trading.  Yahoo Finance lets you track portfolios for free, try picking a couple stocks and see how they do.  Be realistic with your buy and sell prices if you paper trade, seeing for example if you can actually get in at the price you want during intraday trading.  If Mutual Funds are more to your liking, the same principles mentioned above can be applied to those as well.

Good luck, hope it helps.</td>

<td>Capital Market Products
As financial institutions, particularly depository institutions, have faced increased competition and reduced profits in their traditional markets, many have turned to capital market products as an alternative income source. Our lawyers can be very helpful to financial services clients in this important area because we know the market and the legal issues involved in the development and sale of capital market products. 


Some of the capital market products we have helped financial institutions develop, document and market are: 

Loan Sales.  We have had extensive experience in representing the syndications departments of domestic and foreign banks, including the negotiation and documentation of assignment and participation agreements by buyers and sellers for both the sales and trading of par and distressed debt. We also understand what a bank or thrift embarking on a loan sale program must do to its loan documentation to make it "saleable." 
Swaps, Caps, Collars, etc.  We have assisted major banks in both pre-ISDA and ISDA documentation of these products so we know the issues and pressure points. We are also familiar with commodity swaps. 
Securitizations.  We have represented financial institutions in the securitization of virtually every asset imaginable, from accounts receivable and auto loans to HLTs and non-performing assets. 
Public Finance.  We have been a leading firm active in public finance transactions nationwide for more than 100 years. We serve as bond counsel, underwriter's counsel, issuer's counsel, indenture trustee's counsel, credit enhancer's counsel, special disclosure counsel, and special tax counsel in a wide variety of public finance transactions for state and local governments, authorities, and non-profit organizations such as health care and educational institutions.</td>

<td>There is nothing wrong with doubling or tripling your money. What may be wrong is the time frame you want to do it in.

There is a very good rule. The greater the return, the greater the risk. The risk of losing or decreasing the amount of money you start with. Anyone who tells you otherwise probably just wants your money.

That is not to say a fast double or triple is not possible. It just doesn't live in the realm of the probable.

However, you are on the right path. Asking questions and trying to educate youself. The best thing you could do is spend more time in the library reading. Learn some different ways to invest using different investment tools. Learn the pros and cons of each. 

In the meantime find ways to increase your rate of return. Some good suggestions were given in the answer above concerning CD's and other higher paying financial instruments. Just don't lock you money up for too long. The difference in the rate of return is not great enough to justify doing so.

Besides you are going to have some new knowledge and ideas to increase your rate of return within a year or so. That being the case I would not tie it up for more than 18 months.

Good Luck.</td>

<td>What is a pip when trading currency?</td>
<td>It's the minimum movement in a currency, sometimes called a tick elsewhere.

For example, if you're trading EURUSD (currently 1.2108) a pip is 0.0001.  Other currencies are different... eg USDJPY (currently 118.42) a pip is 0.01

A good rule of thumb when trading a standard contract (100,000 of the base currency) a pip is worth somewhere between US$7 and US$15.

<td>Is fidelity.com or fidelity co is a good company to do investment with like stocks, ira.?</td>
<td>I use Fidelity for my mutual funds and Roth IRA I've been happy with their service.  They're not as intuitive to use as ING Direct, but I think they have great investment products.

I'm a 20-something that has been investing for several years, so my perspective tends to be a bit by-the-book.  I use a 40/20/40 strategy.  40% mutual funds/stocks/equity, 20% retirement (IRA, 401k), and 40% cash assets (CDs, bonds, cash).  The majority of my growth in principal comes through purchasing mutual funds, which I prefer over stocks, since they are much less volatile.  I'm risk averse.

I currently use ING Direct, Fidelity, TRowePrice, and Dodge &amp; Cox for my mutuals.  If you're looking for specific funds that, I recommend Fidelity Value and Dodge &amp; Cox I-Stock; the former is very stable while the latter is performing beyond all expectation.  I've gotten 20%+ in less than a year.  However, be careful with I-Stocks-- the foreign market fluctuates a lot.

I know you didn't ask for a full portfolio answer, but I think it helps you get an idea about what to buy/invest in.  With Fidelity you can purchase almost anything on the market, but I go with them because of their funds.  TRowePrice have awesome funds too.  The next company I'm looking at is Vanguard.  By diversify my assets in different funds, I'll get the mixed benefit of using the top fund managers in the world-- Fidelity, Vanguard, and TRowePrice.  You usually can't go wrong with starting at any of these companies.  Fidelity is probably the biggest, but not necessarily the best.  It depends on you risk profile.

It's been several years and I'm learning more each day.  If you're young, I say you're already ahead of the curve.  Good luck with everything!</td>

<td>Does rise in the price of one currency necessarily mean a fall in the price of another?</td>
<td>Yes, though not any one other currency in particular.  Currency prices are the exchange rate for that currency compared to another.  Typically, though, when a currency gets stronger, it becomes more expensive compared to all other currencies.  The Dollar Index is based on a basket of currencies, so if one of those currencies in the basket rises, typically, all the others will follow in the same direction.  It is possible that some event will cause one currency to rise (Let's say if British Unemployment were lower than expected), and another to fall (Let's say riots in Europe), that the Dollar will remain unchanged, although the Euro will be cheaper, but the British Pound will be more expensive.  There are many reasons why the currencies fluctuate, but in the end it is basically an indicator of the the strength of one currency against another.</td>

<td>What could "FMGC" (or "FMCG") ticker symbol be? Bought this NYSE stock in 1987 contest but can't find company!</td>
<td>NYSE stocks are typically three letters long.  They are only longer when you get into preferred stocks, difference classes of stocks, or other obscure types of securities.

eg. Newscorp different class
NWS, NWSA

eg. Freddie Mac
FRE, FREpB (aka FRE+B aka FREPRB depending upon your quote vendor), FREpH (FRE+H, FREPH).

Rarely do stocks have that classes of common shares that go to "G" (I couldn't find any currently listed) so I think the first symbol FMGC is the most likely and that FMG is likely to be the main stock code applicable.

Then I did some searching for FMG and couldn't find it used in recently history. 

There is a comapny listed on the NYSE (FMC Corp, NYSE:FMC) that had a spectacular run in 1987.

Let's say you bought at the start of Spring (20 March) 1987 and sold at the end of Spring 1987 (20 June).  The buy price was $31.25 and sale price $38.875 representing a 24% gain in 3 months.

If the final date of the competition was later (eg. end of summer) - 21 Sep 1987, the price was $50.25 representing a 61% increase.  The stock made its highest close on 2nd Oct 1987 at $58.625 but like all stocks was hit by the 1987 crash (back down to $31 three weeks later).

According to my reords, FCX wasn't listed back in 1987 (they listed in 1988), so I don't think this is the right one.

<td>Why do companies on the stock exchange "buy back" their own shares sometimes?</td>
<td>The fourth answer is the correct answer. A company can not declare profit on their own stocks, even if they buy back at 5 and sell it at $50, not $1 of it will be in income, just additional capital and higher owner's equity. The company itself has no good reason to declare a dividend or a buyback, it helps the share holders only. With less shares outstanding Earnings per share goes up, and that way the company price goes up. It's a way to increase the share price of the company despite no growth, or little growth. Most big companies who have slow growth, but high cash flow make up their slow growth by dividends and buy backs.</td>

<td>The "mud" used while drilling keeps the hole under pressure so it doesn't blow out. In the early days, they blew out often because Mud wasn't used then. The Mud is heavier than salt water, so it exerts more pressure at the bottom of the hole, and it suspends the cuttings better than water, for removal. 

When drilling several thousand feet deep, several different types of rock are encountered: shale, sandstone, limestone, etc.

Some of these rock type swell when flushed with water, and causes problems with the drilling. So oil or deisel is substituted in place of water to mix the mud in.</td>

<td>Putting Coins Into Circulation
The procedures for putting coins into circulation are similar to those for currency. The United States Mint produces coins in Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco, and ships them to the Federal Reserve Banks and to authorized armored carriers, which supply banks that need coins to meet the public's demand. 

The distribution of coins differs from that of currency in some respects. First, when the Fed receives currency from the Treasury, it pays only for the cost of printing the notes. However, coins are a direct obligation of the Treasury, so the Reserve Banks pay the Treasury the face value of the coins. Second, large banks in some Federal Reserve Districts participate in a Direct Mint Shipment Program, and receive coins directly from the Mint. In the New York area, there also is an arrangement under which banks that need coins buy them from banks that have a surplus. To promote the arrangement, the New York Fed stands ready to match banks that have excess coins with those that need coins.</td>

<td>Why do Company CEO's or other high company positions buy stock on the open market?</td>
<td>That is a good question since they have so many stock options, that it would choke a cow. 

One possible reason is that they want their name to appear on the list of insider trades so that people will think the stock of the company is undervalued and buy it to drive up the price so that they can exercise their options and make more money.  I admit that this logic is a little devious, but then again these are devious people we are talking about. 

Another reason is that they think the stock is a good buy. OK, the possibility does exist. 

Another reason is that they are trying to increase their holdings in the company as part of a power struggle for control of the company. This would possibly be the case in a company with only a few million shares outstanding.  

Another reason would be to put the squeeze on shorts. The classic example of this was Alan Ryan of Stutz Motor Car Company. Members of the New York Stock exchange had shorted the stock of Stutz Motor Car in 1920. Ryan controlled the company. He bought all the available outstanding stock of the company so that the shorts could not cover their positions. He had them by the balls. Then the exchange intervened because their members were in jeopardy of being wiped out and halted trading in Stutz.</td>

Or you get a full distribution, but I don't recommend that, the Federal Withholding Taxes will eat up your money!  Also, if you have a statement from the bank or company that manages the Pension Plan, you may be able to skip contacting your previous employer and just send a transfer request to them.  When you open a new IRA (at the place of your choice, their are many on line places) they should have a form that can be sent to have your old Pension rolled over.  Let me know if you have any additional questions.</td>

<td>Morningstar should have most anything you want to know about mutual funds: http://www.morningstar.com/Cover/Funds.html

However, there's a good reason why they say for mutual funds that past performance doesn't mean much for future returns.  Often times, the biggest gainers in the 1 year category just took huge risks or got lucky, so use some good judgment and try to do some research before investing, rather than just picking the last hot mutual fund, which is a good way to get underperformance.</td>

<td>what is the difference between earnings momentum and price momentum strategies ? Thank You?</td>
<td>Hi,

Earning momentum measures the acceleration or deceleration in the growth of operating earnings per share for the latest quarter, the previous three quarters, and an estimate for the next quarter. 

Rather than actual quarterly earnings figures, 12-month earnings ending with each quarter are used, to eliminate seasonal fluctuations. A curve is fitted to the five earnings figures, and a second derivative is calculated to measure the curvature (acceleration or deceleration) of the curve.

While

Price Momentum is a near-term stock price performance indicator with most performance occurring in the following month to quarter. 

Price Momentum looks for companies with good twelve-month performance that have based or corrected in the last quarter and especially in the last month. 

Regards,

Rose

<td>Will i-bonds rate go up or down on May 1, 2006?  Where can I find info for that?  Thanks.?</td>
<td>the 6.73% rate is only good for six months. Moreover, based on the level of the Consumer Price Index for January, it's possible that the rate for the following six months could be quite low.

I bonds have a base rate that is fixed for the life at the bond at issue - currently 1% - and they earn the inflation rate above that. The inflation rate is calculated as the difference between the level of the CPI in March and September. September's level was 198.8. The January level announced today was 198.3, down .5 points from September's level.

If the March index, which will be announced on April 19, is still under 198.8, the next I bond inflation component will be negative. Since I bonds were introduced in 1998, this has never happened.
If the inflation component goes negative, it can wipe out an I bond's fixed rate. However, an I bond's composite rate (fixed rate plus inflation rate) can't go below zero, no matter how deeply the CPI dips. This gives I bonds an advantage over the Treasury's big-boy inflation security, TIPS, which actually decline in value when the CPI goes negative.

The silver lining to this situation is that a negative or low inflation rate might force the Treasury to raise the I bond fixed-rate to a more attractive level than the current 1%.</td>

<td>I want to get an IRA and need help finding a suitable one.?</td>
<td>Load funds charge you an additional fee to purchase.  You buy them at something call the POP, or Public Offering Price.  The load is how the broker who sold you the fund makes his or her money.  Depending on how much you buy, you may be able to get a discount, but since we are talking an IRA you won't be able to put in enough cash to get that discount for some time.  There are three general types of loaded funds, Class A, B, and C.  A is a front end load, meaning you pay an extra charge up front (often times 5.75% or more).  Let's say you buy a fund and it makes 10% that year.  Considering the load, you really only made 4.25%.  Call B shares have what is called a back end load.  You pay a load when you sell them, depending on how long you have held them.  In order to sell without a fee you had to have held most Class B funds for 7 years.  Class C have a fee if you sell them in the first year, but they have the highest ongoing fees, or expense ratios of any of the loaded funds, sometimes going up to almost 3%.  

When it come to no-load funds, they typically are the way to go.  Just check to make sure that their expense ratio's aren't too high either.  The expense ratio is really the cost of running the fund, paying the manager, etc.  Some people will say don't buy a fund unless it has an expense ratio of 1% or lower, I would actually raise that to 1.5%, especially in the case of some specialty funds.  

I would agree that Vanguard is a good choice, but I would also check Fidelity.  They are the two largest no-load fund companies, and have a different philosophy when it comes to investing.  You can also start an IRA at Fidelity with as little as $200 if you have an additional $200/month coming in automatically-it's called their Simple Start IRA.  I would check out both websites, call both firms to get an idea about which one can help you more.  Just one heads up, though-Fidelity is 24 hours.  Vanguard is not.  ;)</td>

For an owner to receive a periodic interest or principal payment, a coupon attached to the bond for that interest payment date must be clipped off and sent to the issuer. The ownership of registered bonds is recorded with the issuer, so interest and principal payments can be disbursed automatically. Most bonds issued in recent years are registered and their ownership is tracked electronically."

I would recommend William O'Neil's "The Successful Investor" as a good starting point. Follow that up with Peter Lynch's "Beating the Street". That should provide you with two strategies that you can learn from in building your own investment strategy.

Other good books include "The Motley Fool Investment Guide" by Tom and Dave Gardner or "Real Money" by James Cramer.

I have read all the books above and devised a strategy that adopts a bit from each one. 

Another thing you can do is invest using a fictional portfolio. Let that run for a few months to see if you are ready to take on wall street. In the meantime, let a professional look after your money (ie, mutual funds). Once you are ready, sell the fund and invest on your own.

Remember, the time spend learning about investing is far less then the money lost by not being prepared.

You are smart to get on this megatrend, and there's plenty of time and easy money left for it if you stick around (have you ever heard anybody say there's still easy money in any stock market or sector????).  Anxiety about our poisoned environment will only increase, and Americans with money can only do one thing about it--insulate themselves as best they can with water purifiers and safer food and such.  With the Bush administration attacking environmental protections every day, "natural" and organic foods are getting free advertising worth billions.  The only down side is these stocks are not recession resistant like agribusiness food stocks.  If things get bad, people will go back to ingesting dangerous chemicals to save money.

Another related megatrend that head-in-the-sand Republicans are missing out on is the earth's population is systematically destroying its supply of usable fresh water.  The companies that can purify, move, desalinate, or control potable water are going to profit massively from endless demand for shrinking supply.</td>

These include U.S. government bonds, municipal bonds and bonds issued by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (although the GSEs comply with FASB rules "voluntarily").  Corporate bonds and asset-backed securities have to be registered unless they're offered in "private placements."

<td>What is a holding company?</td>
<td>A holding company is a company that owns enough voting stock in another firm to control management and operations by influencing or electing its board of directors.

Strictly speaking, the term "holding company" might be used to describe any company that owns a majority of shares in another company. Usually, though, the term signifies a company which does not produce goods or services itself, but, rather, whose only purpose is owning shares of other companies (or owning other companies outright). Holding companies allow the reduction of risk for the owners and can allow the ownership and control of a number of different companies.

Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest publicly traded holding companies; it owns numerous insurance companies, manufacturing businesses, retailers, and other companies. Another large holding company of note is UAL Corporation, a publicly traded holding company whose only purpose is to wholly own United Airlines.

Sometimes a company intended to be a pure holding company identifies itself as such by adding "Holdings" or "(Holdings)" to its name. This was spoofed by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman in their book Good Omens with the fictional company Holdings (Holdings) Incorporated.</td>

There are many good books in the market, just to name a few authors ( John J.Murphy, Martin Pring, Edwards and Magee, and Steve Nison ( Japanese Candlesticks, 2nd edition ).

Now for Gold, you will notice that on a monthly chart( major trendline ) Gold is in a very healthy trend.

On the weekly trend ( intermediate )Gold is in a congestion band where prices are swinging between 535 / 589 $.

On the daily graph, the trend is up.

Please take a look on the following web page:

Drawing up the contract and finding that other party might be more trouble than its worth depending on how much you are planning on investing. Another alternative would be to go to an exchange bank and exchange your money for this currency you want to invest in. If the currency appreciates you can exchange it back later at the higher rate. But you won't be earning any interest in the mean time. A final option is to invest in the government bonds of the country who's currency you want to purchase.

<td>Apart from IRA, Roth IRA, what other federally insured investment options are available for investing?</td>

Also, Savings Bonds and Treasury bills, but these are really long-term investments (10+ years) and the rate of return is questionable right now.

By the way, it is important to distinguish between investment products (ie. CD's, Money Markets) and investment plans (ie. IRAs, 401(k)s).  The distinction is that the plan is the governing account and the product is what actually makes you the money.  So your plan is the 401(k) but the product might be mutual funds. 

Also, look out for Federal insurance on your investment products.  For example, you could have an IRA that is not insured if you are investing in mutual funds and a 401(k) that is insured if you are investing in a Money Market.  

If insurance is your biggest worry, just ask your bank or investment house whether the product you are funding is insured.</td>

The reason it can only become better is because Iraq is a war-torn country that happens to be very wealthy. The United States and other western countries are currently investing billions and billions of dollars in Iraq. If our governments are investing in Iraq, then I think it’s a fairly good indication that we should too. Governments are not in the business of giving money away without any kind of return. I believe our governments intend to see Iraq flourish. Once that happens, the Iraqi Dinar can only go up.

<td>Expected return and standard deviation of a portfolio?</td>
<td>You can find the answer to this question in any standard introductory finance text book.  Brealey &amp; Myers book is a good source.

The expected return of a portfolio is easy enough to compute.  You need to take each asset in the portfolio and find its portfolio weight.  This is just the market value of the asset divided by the market value of the portfolio.  Multiply this weight by the expected return of the asset.  Add them all up and you have the expected return of your portfolio.

For example, if you have a two stocks in your portfolio.  One averages a return of 10% per year and the other averages a return of 14% per year.  Suppose you have 40% of your money in the first stock and 60% in the other.  Then you have a portfolio return of 0.40x10%+-.60x14% = 12%

The standard deviation of the portfolio (AKA volatility) is a little trickier.  You need to know the variance of returns for each asset as well as the covariance of returns between each pair of assets.  Imagine a portfolio with ten stocks.  You could build a 10x10 grid (matrix).  In each cell, you could put the covariance between two assets.  So in column 1 row 2, you have the covariance between the first and second asset.  In column 7 row 5, you have the covariance between stock 7 and stock 5.  When the row &amp; column are the same, you put the variance (row 5, column 5 has the variance of stock 5).  This grid is called the Variance-Covariance Matrix.  To get the variance of the whole portfolio, you can do the following.  For each cell, multiply the value of the cell by the two portfolio weights.  So, in column 3 row 8, you multiply that covariance by the weight of stock 3 and the weight of stock 8.  Now add up all 100 numbers.  This is the portfolio variance.  Take the square root to get the variance.

If yu know matrix algebra, there is easier notation.  Multiply a vector with the weights times the matrix, then multiply that by the transpose of the vector to get the portfolio variance.</td>

<td>After selling stocks - How long does it take for the funds to free up?</td>
<td>Yes, it's usually three days once you sell a stock before the funds are "settled".  Usually the broker will allow you to purchase another stock, but if you sell that stock before the original funds are settled, you will have taken a "Free Ride".  

"Free-riding is the term used for buying and selling a security without having the funds to pay for original purchase.  Purchases must be paid for with settled funds or by depositing new money." --Scottrade.com

Scottrade's policy is, after two violations the account is suspended for 90 days.  If it happens again it may be restricted permanently.

The potential exists where you may be forced to take a "Free Ride" to avoid a loss, especially if you have a stop loss set and the stock plummets right after you buy it.  That is one reason it is critical to do your homework before buying into any stock, especially if you're an active trader.</td>

<td>Restrictive covenants are conditions to the bond. they usually apply to the issuer of a bond.  In the 1980's Bonds with such covenants were used to protect companies against hostile takeovers.  The covenants prevented a hostile acquirer from buying and then taking on more debt to finance the acquisition.  Its basically a guarentee that protects the bond holder from having the bond becoming more risky (I.e. lower credit rating) then when it was issued.</td>

The volatility in this sector is due to the demand fluctuations in the end product sectors, such as computers, batteries, cell phones, etc...  Also, the integrity of the supply chain in both the upstream and downstream directions contributes to how much raw material semis can purchase and how many units they can ship out the door.  Finally, huge investments in R&amp;D spending are necessary to keep pace with the changing technology and many of these ventures fail.  Some are wildly successful and produce large returns.  This is semiconductor economics in a nut shell.  There's a ton more information if you look up semiconductor organizations.</td>

It's known as Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether if I remember correctly and when it leaks from tanks one drop can contaminate 10,000 gallons of water and it's nearly impossible to clean up (my bro's a chemist).

The demand continually goes up for these alternative fuel additives which drives up the price.

I can tell you that as of the last 3 months we haven't even had fuel at gas stations WITH ethanol. Ethanol gas here was usually 3 cents cheaper, but now it's all being exported, so we're building more plants to meet demand.</td>

<td>Why/why not is the use of excess returns more appropriate thanthe use of raw returns?</td>
<td>Hi,

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) theory suggests that the expected excess return on a specific stock is proportional to the the expected excess return on market. The formula is as follows:

Excess return on stock= Beta of the stock * (Excess return on market)

Beta of a stock is a coefficient which shows the extent the stock is affected by the market movements. It is estimated from historical returns.

In sum, if you have the beta of your stock and the excess return on market, you can calculate the excess return on your stock. Note that excess return is simply the raw return on your stock minus the risk free interest rate:

Excess Return = Raw Return - Risk free rate</td>

Other negative costs include high fuel prices which affects its product transportations from distribution centers to stores. Also, it has heavy competition from others like Target that are biting into its Market Share. On the positive side, it is expanding a lot internationally.

<td>How to buy stocks at the stock market? What are the requirements? What is the process?</td>
<td>This is just the process for opening an account and starting to trade stocks.  Learning which stocks to trade can take years, and is way to complicated to try to explain here:

To open an account, go to a brokerage firm (like Schwab, Etrade, Scottrade; whoever) and get a form to open an account, or you could just download the form from the internet.  

Fill out the form, and send it to the brokerage firm (or you can drop it off at the brokerage firm).  

Wait for the firm to open an account for you, it won't take long and they'll send you the info when its open or you could call/ drop by their office.  

Now start trading.  You would typically trade by calling the firm and telling them what to buy/ sell, or doing it over the internet.

This is a very very general explanation, but there are about 100 details you will need to decide for yourself along the way.  ie what kind of account; are you rolling an ira or something into the new account (the brokerage firm will handle this, you just fill out another form); do you want a full service broker (more expensive but gives you more advice on what to buy) discount broker (less expensive, some advice) or deep discount broker (cheap, but you are on your own in terms of what to buy); and many other details.  

Of course the brokerage can help you with most of the details, but they can't teach you how to choose which stocks to buy/ sell (and quite frankly the picks given by the full service brokers may not be any better than throwing darts at a newspaper); this part takes years of trial and error to figure out - so hey, get going.  No time like the present to start.

<td>A certificate of deposit is basically a restricted savings account.  You must keep cash in a fund and not withdraw - if you do, there is a penalty.  4% for 6 months is really good; I had a 6 month cd before for a lower rate.

I wouldn't even call a cd an investment - there is virtually no risk since your account is fdic insured.

At the end of the cd term when it matures, you can either collect all of the money in the fund including principal and interest, or just leave it in and it will roll-over for another 6-12 months.  There is a 10 day period starting at the maturity date in which you have to close the cd if you cannot collect on the maturity date.

Those are the rules at my bank, I am sure they are similar at yours.

A benefit for a cd is simply the higher rate compared to a negligible rate for a regular savings account.</td>

<td>what is the difference between a bull and bear market?</td>
<td>A bull run on the stock exchange is a time when the investors create a situation that they buy shares at lower price and the buying activity is more than the selling side. In such case the prices will go on and then a reasonable rise in price means a good return for the investor. Such upswing is the Bull Market..... the Bull uses his horn to rise the stock index.

On the other hand there might be heavy selling and out pass the buying. Higher no of sellers will mean a competition to sell shares. So with more stocks available to buy the buyer will want a still lesser price. So the prices will keep falling and finally a time will come where is little to sell. At such lower prices investors may buy because that is the lowest price at which they can buy. Thus it is like a bear hugging the prey when it is on free fall. Thus the Bear run...

Long story short.... Bulls.... upswing...... Bears.... downwards..

<td>When I invest a stock for long term, how many years should I invest then? 10points!!!!!!!!!!?</td>
<td>Really depends on your definition of long term and what you think the company is worth now and in the future.  For tax purposes (in the US) long term is usually considered greater than one year.  When financial advisors talk about investing for the long term I think they usually mean 5-10 years or more.

The real answer, though, is that you need to somehow figure out what you think the company is worth and then decide whether the stock price is high, low, or about right.  Most people use numbers like the price-to-earnings ratio, cash flow, income, and debt ratios to figure out the health of a company.  The nice thing about these number is that they are all readily available at sites like Yahoo! Finance and they're quick and easy to use when comparing one firm to another.  The downside is that they only present a snapshot of the company and you have to use some common sense when deciding which ratios are most important.

For instance, looking at a retail company like Gap it's important to look at inventory turnover and same store sales figures along with some of the other information above to get a more complete picture of the firm.  But if you're looking at a software company like Microsoft you won't find same store sales (they have no stores) and the inventory numbers may not be as meaningful.

If you want to get more advanced you look at things like future cash flow predictions and net present value analysis and that sort of fun stuff to determine what you think the firm is worth and compare that to the stock price.</td>

So even if the war ends 3 years from now, Iraq won't rebuild itself less then 5 years later. I'd say you may see a value increase in 5 years, but nothing significant until 10 years have elapsed.

<td>What kind of stock would be good to invest in right now for the long term?</td>
<td>If you have a strong stomach for $100 price fluctuations in a day (that's $10,000 on 100 shares), you can buy something like Google.

But first, what is your definition of Long-Term? If you had bought anywhere around the 2000 high in the stock market, you would still be waiting to get even after six years, and wouldn't mind waiting another seven years to make a profit if you are truly a "long-term" investor.

The "Buy-and-Hold" strategy really doesn't hold water if you consider it depends on when you "buy." You might go 25 years without a profit, if history is any guide. But if that is your deal, then go for it.

Otherwise, you have to consider that the Dow is again approaching that all-time historical high set in Jan 2000 at 11,721.  Looks like a Double Top to me, but some people say we could double that again. Logically, this is one of the scariest markets I've ever seen in two decades of watching it; just pick something that is stable, anything. Doesn't exist, does it. Anything could send this market over the edge to the great void. But hey, it might double too, who knows. 

For most people, the name of the game is capital preservation. You don't invest when the market gets too risky or too frothy or is nearing a market top or an old market top, or when the market is overpriced, or unstable, and all of these things are true today. There really is a time when cash is King. That 1.5% CD is going to look pretty good when everyone else is cryin' in their beer about losses. Or the market could just go sideways to work off the excesses, but either way, you're safe if you're out. Wanna trhow the dice, go to Vegas.

If you wish to research the “Buy and Hold Strategy” further, or perhaps trade yourself, I recommend two book titles. One is called "Which Is Better, Buy-and-Hold or Market Timing?" The other is "Do You Have What It Takes to Be a Market Timer?" They will give you plenty to think about.

To learn about the basic principles of money, get the book "The Richest Man in Babylon." by George S. Clason</td>

<td>Owning a mutual fund is safer than owning individual stocks. If you own a particular mutual fund, you own shares in that fund. They in turn own shares in the individual stocks. Mutual funds are significantly safer than owning individual stocks because they own so many different stocks. they are called "diversified". By law they cannot own more than a certain % of their total money in one stock. This is safe because if one single stock does poorly, you may not even feel it, since there are 200 other stocks in the mutual fund that may be doing well. hope this helps. P.S. stick with Vanguard or T-Rowe Price, they truly have a great product.

The stock market in the US grows about 17% a year if you look at the LONG term (like 50 years or so, about the time many people work before they retire).  Inflation runs about 4.x% and banks average somewhere about 7%.  These figures change depending on how the economy is doing, hence you have to keep an eye on things and move money around.  Bonds also come in to play, but that gets pretty complex...
Money in a bank is safer, but it grows more slowly, sometimes slower than inflation (which means that even though the account goes up in numbers, the buying power of that money is actually going down).</td>

FX is one of the most risky investments you can make because holding cash doesn't earn any type of return regardless of what currency it's in.  The only way you can make money is to buy and sell at the right time.  When you compare this to bond or stock investments, both of those appreciate over time just by holding them.

If you have savings to invest, I would say buy a mutual fund or put together a diversified portfolio of stock and bond investments.  Don't waste your time or money on FX.</td>

After all, it is individuals that trade with one another, not countries.

Take two people (Bob &amp; Jim)

Bob has 2 apples and Jim has 2 oranges.

Bob would like one of Jim's oranges, so he offers to trade one of his apples.

Jim agrees and the two make the trade (1 apple for 1 orange).

What's the economic impact?

After the trade, you have two satisified individuals. Each now has the things that they value most. Bob valued Jim's orange more than his extra apple, and vice versa with Jim.

It's a win-win situation.

That is the economic impact of EVERY trade that occurs in the marketplace (UNLESS there is outside interference with the exchange).

Now, imagine that Bob lived in Italy and Jim in Canada...

It wouldn't make a difference.

<td>I have a $500 Gulf Coast Bond. How do I get the $500 out of it?  Is there a time limit for how long I keep it?</td>
<td>The way bonds work, you only get the face value at the end of the term, if you are to sell it early, then you have to accept market price which may be more or less than $500. The market price depends on the coupon rate, which is how much money your bond is getting you, for example, if you get $50 a year, that is a %10 coupon rate, VS, the market rate, which is the yield being traded in the market. So if you your coupon rate is higher than the market you can sell it over $500 if less, than  opposite, but if it was issued last March, very little probably changed and you would probably get from $490-510 for selling it.</td>

If it's for retirement, or college education, or that second home, and we have a time horizon of 10 years or more, then ABSOLUTELY is MSFT a good buy right now.  It's a great company that's an industry leader, operates globally, and keeps increasing its dividend.  It's EXACTLY the sort of company you'd want to own. True, it's not as low as it's ever been, but timing the market is proven to not be anywhere near as important as TIME IN the market in the vast majority of cases.  

If, however, this is more of a short-term investment, then of course price becomes much more important.  Other tech plays that are more attractively valued at the current exact time are INTC and DELL.  Both are way off their 52-week highs.  

Either way, keep in mind, lots of huge Value funds hold Microsoft right now, so the big money people think it's a good buy.  We can learn a lesson from that.

Also please keep in mind, that MSFT Being down over 3 points just TODAY(4/28/06) creats an incredible buying opportunity, especially if you're going to keep owning it for a while.

Good luck, and try to avoid short term trading.  In enarly every case, it leads to ruin!

No, the market is not complex at all.  Just the maturity of thinking behind it is humongous.  

Think as if stocks is just your own business.  You first start with your own money.  But then the business grows.  You start making profits.  Then you borrow money.  First you will borrow on interest only.  Later people will be willing to trust you and share your risk for profit just like you would be doing.  You want to give away your risk and in exchange for profits.  The market is about exchanging risks for returns.

As measuring risk is complicated it just keeps getting complicated.  To add oil to the fire, We have an array of economic parameters, Industries and investments.  If we try to look at the Stock market analytics as a measure of performance, risks and ability to forecast you will be able to read well into them.
--------
I read into your question as how do you want to get started with investments, hence the earlier answer.

I'd strongly suggest, don't do it yourself.  I have burnt my fingers.  Use a Financial Planner.

But if you still want to do it yourself I have some resourses and pointers you can check out.

<td>Both bonds and preferred stock are "fixed-income" investments.  They both offer periodic payments at a (usually) fixed rate.  They also both behave pretty similarly in relation to interest rates.  Which to own depends on how much credit risk--risk the issuer of your bond or preferred could default or that their credit could go downhill--you are willing to take on.  Preferred stock usually offers higher yields than bonds, but also comes with more credit risk, since bondholders get paid before preferred holders if the company is ever liquidated.  For both bonds and preferred, prices go down when interest rates go up and vice versa.

It sounds like you have a good, solid preferred portfolio with minimal credit risk.  There is always the possibility that one of your issuers could go south--look at General Motors--but your biggest risk is probably to interest rates.</td>

<td>That is a loaded question.  First is interest.  there are several theories.  The most popular is the expectations theory defined as the yield or interst rate is derived from expectations.  Ultimately people have expetations that the interst rate will prevail.  If the rate will prevail then the demand will keep the interst rates up.  There is also the force of the Federal system.  this usually occurs when a bad economic situation occurs, the Fed will pump money into the economy to stimulate the economy.  This fits into the first theory on how expectations drive the market.  I hope you can follow this.</td>

You know the future value and present value of the investment as well as the holding period.  So, the CAGR would be found at the total yield (FV/PV) raised to the one over nth power where n is the holding period.  Then the whole quantity is reduced by one.  So the complete formula looks like ((FV/PV)^(1/n))-1.

<td>i have 500000 dollars to invest.What are the best safe ways to invest this and get the highest interest yields</td>
<td>It all depends on what risk you are willing to take. The ones you mentioned are safest but disperse it between banks because you are only insured $100,000 total deposit per bank from the FDIC. So if you go that route and don't disperse you stand to lose 400,000 If the bank tanks.

You could also look into bonds. AAA,AA, Aaa are all very safe but again there is always the risk of you losing everything and these are not insured. However based on their rating they are unlikey to tank.

The lower the rating i.e. B, C, D bonds will give you a higher yield but they are more risky the lower the letters go. 

Best bet, see a investment professional who can assess your ability to take risk and help advise you on the best ways to disperse.</td>

<td>Commodity Futures and Forex Interest Rates What's the Difference?</td>
<td>Definitely interest rates (plus other things) affect foreign exchange levels.  The thing is you need to look at both countries interest rates.  If you're trading US Dollar vs Canadian Dollar, you need to look at US and Canadian rates.

If one of the two countries (say the US) raises it's rates, some people will move their money into that countries currency (USD) and that currency should strengthen.

If you're trading forex futures you should look at the interest rates in the two countries around the time of your future's expiry.  I.e. if you're trading a future that expires in 3 Months, you should look at the 3 month interest rates in both countries (so you could look at the interest rates of bonds maturing in 3 months, or cash deposit rates for 3 months).

I.e. I believe you will find that the price for a USD-&gt;CAD forex future expiring 3 months from now is the current USD-&gt;CAD fx spot price (1.13) + (USD 3M rate - CAD 3M rate)*3/12.  Which would end up giving you something like 113.2 .</td>

<td>What exactly is a money market account and will it make my money grow?</td>
<td>A money market account is a type of savings account offered by banks and credit unions just like regular savings accounts. The difference is that they usually pay higher interest, have higher minimum balance requirements (sometimes $1000-$2500), and only allow three to six withdrawals per month. Another difference is that, similar to a checking account, many money market accounts will let you write up to three checks each month. 
Like other bank accounts, the money in a money market account is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which means that even if the bank or credit union goes out of business (which is very rare) your money will still be there. The FDIC is an independent agency of the federal government that was created in 1933 because thousands of banks had failed in the 1920s and early 1930s. Not a single person has lost money in a bank or credit union that was insured by the FDIC since it began. 

Money earning even more money!
When you put your money into a money market savings account it earns interest just like in a regular savings account. Interest is money the bank pays you so that they can use your money to fund loans to other people. That doesn't mean you can't have your money whenever you want it, though. That's just how banks make money -- by selling money! Basically, it works like this: 

You open a money market account at the bank. 
The bank pays you interest on the money that you deposit and leave in that account. 
The bank then loans that money out to other people, only they charge a slightly higher interest for the loan than what they pay you for your account. 
The difference in interest they pay you verses the interest they charge others is part of how they stay in business. 
How does interest work?
Interest on money market accounts is usually compounded daily and paid monthly. The cool thing about compounded interest is that the bank is paying you interest on the money they've paid you in interest! 

Interest rates paid by money market accounts can vary quite a bit from bank to bank. That's because some banks are trying harder to get people to open anaccount with them than others -- so they offer higher rates. 

Another difference you'll sometimes find with money market accounts is that the more money you have in the account the higher the interest rate you get. Always check with the bank about how the interest rate may change. 

It can cost you!
Like a basic savings account, money market accounts let you withdraw your money whenever you want. However, you usually are limited to a certain number of withdrawals each month. Banks will usually charge a fee (typically around $5) if you don't maintain a certain balance in your money market account. There may also be a fee (typically around $5-10) for every withdrawal in excess of the maximum (usually six) the bank allows each month. 

Because of these possible fees, you should always shop around and compare what different banks are offering. Things you should look at include: 

Fees and services charges on the account 
Minimum balance requirements 
Interest rate paid on your balance 
What happens once you have a money market account?
With a money market account you'll get a small book called a register (like a checkbook register) where you write in your beginning balance (the amount you originally deposit) and all of your future deposits and withdrawals. This tool helps you keep track of how much money you have. 

Each month, your bank (or credit union) will send you a statement of your account either in the mail or by e-mail if you prefer. The statement will list all of your transactions as well as any fees charged to your account and interest your money has earned. In order to make sure you didn't forget to write down any withdrawals and/or deposits (and also to double-check the bank's activities) you should go through each entry in your register and compare it wi</td>

<td>How does the stock market work?</td>
<td>What makes stocks rise and fall is "supply and demand".  When demand for a stock is high (lots of people want to buy it), it goes up.  When the supply for a stock is high (lots of people want to sell it) than it goes down.  The reasons why some investors want to buy a stock and why some investors want to sell a stock vary tremendously, and that's what makes a market - many people with different opinions about a company.  If more investors think that yahoo sucks than think that it's a great company, the stock will fall.  

In general, people form these opinions based on how a company performs (how much money it makes).  However, we as investors can't see how much money a company makes each day.  We really only find out how it's doing about 4 times per year when the company announces its results for the previous 3 months.  So over the long run (serveral months or several years), a stock will move based on how well its financial perfomance has faired.  In the shorter term however (an hourly or daily basis) while everyone is wondering how the financials are looking, the stock moves based on what people are feeling at that particular time.  So short term movements are more speculative in nature (people guessing how well the financials will look).

A wise man once said, "Over the short-term, the market is a voting machine.  Over the long-term, it's a weighing machine."  There's no guessing about your weight once you get on that scale.  It is what it is.  So over the long term, if a company is good at making money, it's stock will rise.</td>

Looked at differently, if you have any amount and want to know what rate I would need to double my money in 6 years then divide 72 by 6 to arrive at 12 %</td>

<td>what happens after a stock split?</td>
<td>After a stock split an investor who owns the stock would have twice as many shares (if it was a 2 for 1 stock split).  But the value of each share is cut in half.  So there is no real change in value for the investor.

(Similarly for a 3 for a split: 3 times as many shares at a third of the value per share, etc.)

Companies split their stock for several reasons, not the least of which is that it improves the liquidity of their stock.  If a stock typically has low trade volume, then the same dollar amounts traded in the future would double the share volume.  Other reasons could be that small investors would be more likely to buy the stock if the price is lower, and also, if a company wants to eventually be listed on the NYSE instead of the NASDAQ, then they must have a certain minimum number of shares outstanding (as well as a certain market capitalization).

Hope this helps.

By the way, typically, when a company splits its stocks it is because they think they will continue to do well.  the last thing they want is for the price to fall TOO low and then later have to do a reverse split.  For this reason, following a split, some stocks may perform slightly better than normal.</td>

<td>Is the Federal Reserve behind or ahead of the inflation curve?</td>
<td>The interest rate on 10-year Treasuries is now 50 basis points higher than it stood at the start of the year. This rise coincided with a run-up in many commodity prices.

The market is concerned about incipient inflation but has confidence (at least no less than a month ago) that the Fed will succeed in eventually getting that inflation under control. The argument is that the Fed impacts the economy primarily through its effect on long-term real interest rates, so that the Fed will somehow have to get long-term real interest rates to rise in order to slow down the economy sufficiently to offset the incipient inflation.

Over the past couple of years a few culprits have been identified as causing low long-term yields including foreign central banks managing their currencies, China &amp; Japan, oil exporters not spending their windfall, Saudi Arabia &amp; Russia, and pension funds moving out of stocks and into bonds to better match their long term liabilities.

With China slowly moving to a floating exchange regime, Japan ending its quantitative easing, the collapse of many middle eastern stock markets, and pension funds possibly completing their asset reallocation, current long bonds may be reflecting a drying up of demand

As the housing market continues to weaken it will have serious ramifications for the overall US economy. "The collapse of the housing bubble will throw the economy into a recession, and quite likely a severe recession. A turn in the housing market is central to our economy with a downturn in housing meaning more than 1.3 million lost jobs, bumping up the national unemployment rate by 1 percent and the unemployment rate in house-mad California by 2 percent. Those numbers don't include likely job cuts in housing-dependent businesses, such as mortgage banking, furniture and building materials. A bubble burst would mean the loss of 5 million to 6.3 million jobs. 

The housing run-up has financed consumer spending, creating more than $5 trillion in bubble wealth. Consumers have used "cash-out" mortgages to pay for everything from new kitchens to college tuition. 

To answer your question Yes the Federal reserve acted too late to slow current inflation and the 2007 recession.</td>

<td>what does leveraged buyouts mean .....imply in business terms?</td>
<td>It's a strategy involving the acquisition of another company using a significant amount of borrowed money (bonds or loans) to meet the cost of acquisition. Often, the assets of the company being acquired are used as collateral for the loans in addition to the assets of the acquiring company. The purpose of leveraged buyouts is to allow companies to make large acquisitions without having to commit a lot of capital.  

   
 In a LBO, there is usually a ratio of 90% debt to 10% equity. Because of this high debt/equity ratio, the bonds are usually not investment grade and are referred to as junk bonds. Leveraged buyouts have had a notorious history, especially in the 1980's when several buyouts led to the eventual bankruptcy of an acquired company. This was mainly due to the fact that the leverage ratio was nearly 100% and the interest payments were so large that the company's operating cash flows were unable to meet the obligation. As of 2005, the largest leveraged buyout to date was the acquisition of RJR Nabisco in 1989 by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. (KKR). Depending on the source cited, KKR paid between $25 billion and $31 billion for the acquisition. 

It's ironic that an acquired company's success (in the form of cash on the balance sheet) can be used against it as collateral by the hostile company that acquires it. For this reason, some regard LBOs as an especially ruthless predatory tactic.</td>

<td>Where can you find analysis of past stock earnings and stock price increase after earnings?</td>
<td>This is much harder to do than it may seem.  The chief problem may be that you are keying on the earnings reporting date, not the quarter ending date.  

Thus, if a company reports great results for the quarter 1/06-3/06, but they report their earnings on 4/15/06, you want to see what happened to the stock beginning 4/15 going forward (and you may or may not be interested in the activity on 4/15 itself depending on whether they reported before the market opened, or after it closed).  To do this analysis precisely and automatically with some sort of screening software may not be possible because the earnings reporting dates vary.

Best way I can think of to do this is go to 

www.earnings.com

Not all companies info will be given here, but for a whole lot of companies you can get the history of conference calls for a company, what they reported as earnings, and how this reported number compares to their guidance if they gave any.  Based on the time of day for the conference call you can also make a good guess as to whether the company reported earnings before the market opened or after the market closed.  From there you have to just look for companies that consistently beat quidance and had increasing earnings and check them out.

Also, though you are not asking for my advice, let me throw it in anyhow (you can ignore it if you want).  It sounds like you are trying to get a system for buying certain companies before earnings hoping for either a pop in price after earnings or a slow progression upwards until the next earnings date.  I think you may be onto something, but I doubt you will find an easy little system to follow.  Each company behaves differently (some always beat earnings, some usually hit earnings, some are erratic) but the companies behavior is well known by the people who track the stock and probably built into the price before earnings.  Thus, you are trying to estimate what actual earnings will be compared not to what past earings have been, nor compared to the companies own guidance but rather compared to the markets consensus of what the earnings should be and who knows what that number is.  Also, more important than the companies earnings might be their forward guidance and this may drive the price alot more than the actual earnings.

To give an example for that last sentence, supposed a company consistently beats earnings by varying amounts, and is growing at 20-30% per year.  They guide their earnings 10% above last years number, but since they always beat the market may decide they are just being cautious and based on how their industry has been chugging along the market prices the stock as if earnings will come in 30% above last year.  Earnings come in and are 20% above last year.  On the day they report earnings, the company shows 20% growth, and is still 10% above quidance but will nonetheless probably have a really bad day because the actual earnings are 10% below what the market was expecting.

To give another example suppose a company is growing 20%, is expected to earn 20% more than last year, hits the number perfectly, but then guides lower for next quarter.  Watch out below, the earnings in this case is meaningless.

I guess what I'm saying is there are alot of details to consider and if you get it right 2/3rd of the time you may end up a millionaire in spite of having some really bad days.  Anyhow, www.earnings.com may be the place to look for this data, and best luck with your analysis.</td>

In regards with consumer sentiment, there are certain companies that are less sensitive to consumer sentiment.  For example food industry is really not impacted by consumer sentiment because we all got to eat right? =)  Electronics makers are very susceptible to consumer sentiment because you will buy food before you buy that new iPod, though at the rate this country (USA) is going things may change soon.

If you are investing with a brokerage firm, make sure you are covered under their SIPC insurance (get a brochure of coverages).  Regardless of your choice, remember that in the financial world we have a VERY TRUE saying:  "The higher the risk, the higher the return".  Logically, if you take a risk on a given stock, you may get very lucky and make a killing or you can lose all or part of your investment, conversely you can invest on a T-Bill or bank CD and have a much lower rate of return but sleep at night knowing that your investment is more or less safe; if you secure the services of a financial planner or financial consultant first find out how they are compensated because in most cases they get compensated by the investments you purchase, which means that they have an interest in where you invest regardless of how good or bad it is for you.</td>

The book value is the Shareholder Equity, I think.  Then, you figure out the number of shares to get a book value per share.  To do this, you can take their market cap and divide by the price.

For WMT, this is 191.61B / 45.98 = 4.17 billion shares.
SE/shares = 53.171 / 4.17 = 12.76 book value per share.

Price to book will be price divided by book value per share.
45.98 / 12.76 = 3.60, which is close enough.

P/E is just the price divided by the earnings per share (EPS).

Their EPS was 2.68.
45.98 / 2.68 = 17.2 P/E

<td>Why did AMD's share price dropped more than 10% today (April 13 2005)?</td>
<td>NEW YORK (AP) - Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. dropped hard in midday trading Thursday after some analysts expressed disappointment that the company didn't seem to steal as much market share as expected from archrival Intel Corp. during the first quarter.

On Wednesday, the chip maker said for the first-quarter, it earned $185 million, or 38 cents per share, topping analysts' expectations for 30 cents per share. Gross margins for the quarter were 58.5 percent, up sequentially from 57.3 percent during the fourth quarter.
Credit Suisse analyst Michael Masdea, who has a "Neutral" rating on the stock, called the company's earnings upside "somewhat artificial," driven by improved gross margins, which were based on lower-than expected depreciation, lower incentives and a better mix in sales.

Masdea also speculates that although Intel may report weak results, he doesn't believe Advanced Micro took "material" market share from Intel during the quarter, as was expected. Last month Intel warned its first-quarter revenue would fall short of previous guidance, due to weak demand and a "slight" share loss, fueling speculation that AMD may stolen significant business from Intel.

A.G. Edwards analyst David Wong agrees. Wong, who has a "Hold" rating on Advanced Micro, thinks Intel may have only lost 1 percent to 2 percent market share during the quarter.

"Market share losses by Intel to Advanced Micro in units may have been less than we assumed," Wong wrote in a note. "If this is true, the inventory issues (at Intel) may not be as severe as we have feared."

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, which have traded between $14.08 and $42.70 over the last year, were down $3.08, or 8.7 percent, to $32.34 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Intel shares were up 43 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $19.55 on the Nasdaq</td>

Be aware that fundamental analysis study the CAUSES OF MARKET MOVEMENT while technical analysis study THE EFFECT.

Now, can you imagine the sum of research you woulld have to accomplish should you trade a particular stock, currencies ( Swiss, Euro, Sterling pound, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen..............)

Enormous. Moreover, you have any degree ( Master, Phd. CFA,and so on...).

Be sure that in a graph ( any graphs, does not matter the product ), everything is already discounted according the theory of CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL, WILLIAM F. SHARPE, NOBEL PRICE OF ECONOMY ). Stated in another way, prices tend to lead THE KNOWN FUNDAMENTALS.

For further readings in technical analysis, see these books by authors, leaders in that field ( John J. Murphy, Martin Pring, Steve Nison, Edwards and Magee, and many others...).

Be careful trading any financial markets, There is huge risk and losses pertaining to trading. Be prepare very carefully. Do not pay attention to those who are claiming that you can make a lot of money with their systems.

Begin by studying, a lot, and practice yourself on free trial trafing plattform on the internet.

If the offer is made at a price that is below street value, the company can expect to loose money on the transaction whenever the sale occurs. This for accounting purposes is recorded as a loss to the company, and losses reduce the income of the company - and the loss/reduced income is recorded before the corporate taxes are paid, so the loss is pre-tax.

<td>Your questions:

How to set-up account?
You can go to a reputable brokerage company's website (do your own investigations via internet - different brokerage houses maybe strong in different products) and download the required form. Along with your supporting document, you will have to fax or mail the form to the brokerage house, and probably follow-up with wiring your fund over. Once your account is ready, you are ready to trade. Make sure you are using latest software and anti-virus on your computer (and never use any public computers like in the internet cafe), so that internet security is not compromised.

Most helpful websites?
Well that depends on what you are looking for. For charts, i personally prefer Bigcharts.com and Stockcharts.com. For finance information, Yahoo is good for me, and MSN provide good online stock screening tools. Also, your online brokerage house will provide information too. (side note: you might want to consider using more than one online brokerage house for various reason as long as your resources are not spread too thin.)

You are your best resource and you must always in the driver seat when it comes to managing your own fund. On mutual fund - my personal belief is they are useful if you want to invest in a market that you do not have access to, and are bullish about the outlook. As with most things, always choose the best (morningstar.com should be a good resource for mutual funds.)</td>

<td>It is general recommended that you have a emergency stash of money equal to ~3 months salary stashed away in a Money Market before investing in other things.  Once you have about 12-13K in a money market you can look into investing.  The first place to look is at a 401K at work.  If you have no 401K considered an IRA, possibly a Roth IRA invested in an Index fund. The advantage is the IRA's and 401K's are tax deferred.  Paying off your student loan is a reasonable idea as well.  The stock market does not guarantee a return, paying off your student loan gives you a guaranteed return in lower interest payments in the future.  If you are taking the standard deduction (which I suspect you are), you can't write off your student loan interest.

If your car breaks down, you can use the emergency stash for a new car.  You may also need it if you lose your job; it happens to the best of us.</td>

<td>Is it worth investing in an oil company like Exxon in the current market?</td>
<td>Wouldn't we all like to know the answer to this question? If indeed you had $10 million, there are a lot less risky ways to make lots of money, because you have quoted such a large sum. This is the fantasy that most people get caught in. They pose a valid question on an invalid premise.

People with $10 million don't need to make more than 3-5% a year to get rich. They already are. You, on the other hand, will never get anywhere at the current interest rate on a CD of 3%.Thus the question concerning stocks.

First, you would not put your entire investment into one basket. It was about this time seven years ago when I last owned Exxon stock. I'm a Petroleum Engineer, and know quite a bit about oil companies, and they had just discovered some big fields on the North Slope of Alaska. I woke up one morning, and found my IRA cut in half, when they spilled oil in the Port of Valdez.

Now, I trade Index Futures on the stock market for a living. In my opinion, the Top in the stock market is already in, and direction is now down for several months. 

Some would tell you to diversify, but not by buying five different oil companies, you have to diversify across industries. But I would tell you that all ships rise and fall on the tide, unless you are an exceptional stock picker and fast enough to maneuver your boat to gain headway.

There are times when cash is King, and this is probably one of those times. If you're in a mutual fund, switch to the money market fund or a CD or Treasury Bill; just park it for now. The name of the game is preservation of capital.

If you really do have $10 million, lets start our own mutual fund. Write me at  dredude52@yahoo.com</td>

<td>Your best bet is to try to sell them on eBay.  You will get prices closer to the current market value, but it is a lot more work.  The easiset way is to find a coin dealer in your area, but realize the dealer is in business to make money, so he will offer about 40-60% of the current market value for the coins. He is not cheating you, that is just the typical amount dealers are willing to pay for coins.  If the coin is a rarity, then he will pay closer to the market value.  Good Luck!</td>

Read some books on retirement investing, mutual funds and stocks. You don't have to become an expert. But if you take six months to a year.... you'll save 10's of thousands of $$$ over your lifetime.

Never take tips.
Follow an asset allocation.
Get a stock broker that meets your needs. I use Scottrade. Great pricing but not there to help a new person in the market. Best bet: Schwab or Fidelity Brokerage.

READ READ READ (first)...  Don't chase stocks or mutual funds solely on past performance.

If you see the stock above 36 in the next few weeks, it will probably make another run at its highs at 42.

<td>Are there any online guides that can teach someone with no knowledge how to invest in stocks?</td>
<td>Start by learning HOW to invest, determining WHAT to buy through Fundamental Analysis and determining WHEN to buy through Technical Analysis. 

Start with Investors.com, it's William O'Neil's online version of Investors Business Daily.  The How To Invest section is the best place to start learning the importance of Fundamentals and the basics of Technical Analysis.   The site has the IBD 100, a cross index list of the market leaders, the Stock Checkup, a great tool for checking fundamentals on any stock, and articles and analysis of stocks and general market conditions.  They also run various screens every day which in addition to the other lists, (IBD100, New America, stocks under $10, CANSLIM select, ect) are very helpful for finding investment ideas with solid Fundementals that are ready to move.  The CANSLIM method alone is a very successful and popular trading system, but I prefer to use a combination of Fund &amp; Tech Analysis, rather that just the rating system alone.  This site is also extremely helpful in finding the leading industries and sectors as well as the leaders within those industries.

Yahoo Stock Quotes have excellent Company Profiles, Key Statistics, Current Headlines, etc. for deeper fundamental study and due dilligence.

From there you can move on to more detailed study of Technical Analysis. 

Start with StockCharts.com, they have an excellent free Chart School which helpfully explains various chart patterns and Technical Indicators and overlays.  Pay particular attention to the Chart Patterns section, and make sure you learn about Zig Zag patterns, Bollinger Bands, Moving Average, Volume, RSI, the MACD (Mac-D), The Williams %er, Stochastics, and the Chaikin Money Flow.  Sounds complicated, but when you start chart reading you'll want about a half a dozen or so of these overlays and indicators.  I personally rely heavily on the ZIG-ZAG, MACD, Chaikin Money Flow, Volume, Moving Average and RSI. 

StockTA.com is also an excellent Technical Analysis site, with charted Fibonacci resistance and support lines and will tell you if the stock is bullish or bearish in the short, medium and long run.  The site also has an extensive Candle Pattern Glossary and a fantastic technical screener. 

The above sites do have premium services, but all the services I mentioned are free.  After you've absorbed some of the Technical information, do some reading on Fibonacci numbers and Elliot Wave theory, there are good links in the "School" section of StockTA.com.  I've been using Elliot Wave and Fibonacci's to help refine my in and out points.  StockCharts.com's "ZigZag" overlay helps me plot and count the waves and that helps determine where I am in the overall pattern. 

So basically I'll find interesting stocks through the screens on Investors.com or StockTA.com, run them through the Stock Checkup at Investors.com, if they measure up I'll run them through the Analyisis &amp; Fib Analysis at StockTA.com and do an extensive chart study, examining the 2 yr, 1 yr, 6 mth, 3 mth, 1 mth &amp; 5 day.  I'll also do my due dilligence, studying the profile, key statistics, headlines, etc. through Yahoo Finance and web searches.  If it all measures up and the stock is in a base or in a pull back and it's starting a wave 1 or wave 3, it's time to buy. 

Remember, always protect your downside with a stop loss or a trailing stop loss.  Once you have absorbed a few of the things I've mentioned, the fog will begin to lift and you'll start seeing which stocks should be bought or sold and you'll be able to do your own analysis on any stock. 

If it's all too daunting or confusing, stick with it, it takes time to absorb.  Start by paper trading.  Yahoo Finance lets you track portfolios for free, try picking a couple stocks and see how they do.  Be realistic with your buy and sell prices if you paper trade, seeing for example if you can actually get</td>

An important note:  There are "load" funds and "no load" funds.  The difference is when you buy in.  For the load funds, there is a fee for buying.  For the no load funds there is no up front fee.  Another excellent company that I own is Wells Fargo, with a lot of funds to choose from.  This company has been around for a long time too.  Bottom line, don't take advice from anyone, even me.

<td>Senior notes and bankruptcy?</td>
<td>Priority in a Chapter 11 or Chapter 13 case will be dictated by both the Bankruptcy Code and the plan, while disbursement under a Chapter 7 is governed by the Bankruptcy Code and the secured status of the claims. Section 507 of the Bankruptcy Code outlines the priority ranking for various classification of debts. (site below)  Section 1122 et. seq. for Chapter 11 and Section 1322 et. seq. outline the criteria for classification of various claims in the plan.

The first step in ranking the obligations you listed would be in determining the secured status of the various classes.  Secured claims are usually paid first.  In your example, if the home was being surrendered and after the first mortgage was satisfied there was nothing left for the second mortgage, then it is quite conceivable that all of the claims you listed would have an identical priority in most bankruptcy cases.  It is equally conceivable that the different categories could be secured or fall within one of the priority provisions of 507 and completely alter the order.  

For example here is one possible order that puts the second mortgage as being the last class to receive priority:

1. Notes Payable, but secured by deposits held by the bank which loaned the money.  This would have top priority.

2. Accounts Payable: Debtor is placed in an involuntary case, a claim arising in the ordinary course of the debtor's business or financial affairs after the commencement of the case, but before the appointment of a trustee and allowed under 507(a), (b) and (c).

3. Senior Notes: Unsecured debt, but given a higher claims ranking over other unsecured debt in the plan.

4.  Second Mortgage:  A second mortgage on a property surrendered to the first mortgage that consumed all the equity becomes an unsecured claim and is treated as a general unsecured claim in the plan.

Of course, the order could be completely re-arranged with different fact scenarios.  Look to your specific facts and the language of the plan.</td>

The best place to start is by opening an account with an online broker. This requires a minium deposit/balance of $500 to trade. Scottrade is one of the few that offer low commissions, no inactivity fees, and pays interest on your account balance. With around $2000 in your account you can even write checks from it.

As far as learning, go to your library and borrow books and videos (a cheap resource many books/videos on this subject are around $100 each). Also watch TV business news (NBR on PBS or CNBC). Current stock market guru Jim Cramer(CNBC's Mad Money host) has an insitefull book "Real Money" not that this is all you'll need to know but its a very good start for a beginner.

Wishing you the best of good buys!

<td>What you think of Crystallex (KRY)?</td>
<td>I was checking this out the other day, but bought PTEN instead.  This stock is fundamentally unsound, the only positive is the 31% quarterly revenue growth, undoubtedly due to the increase in gold prices.  Technically, it's another story; all indicators are Very Bullish in the Short, Mid and Long terms and the stock seems to be forming a solid base finding support at 5.94.  Personally, I'd buy this stock if I weren't currently in another issue, though I rarely get involved with an issue that is fundamentally weak because it makes very little sense.  

Having said that, if I get stopped out of PTEN and KRY is still in it's base, my play will be to get in as close to 5.75 as possible with a fixed stop loss at $4.90 because volatility could push it to it's previous resistance at 4.91.  If it closes below 5.25 I'll be keeping a close eye on it, and will consider cutting my losses, depending on indicators.  If it stops me out before I can react I'll just take my loss and move on, but it will be a much larger loss than I normally take, because I usually set an 8-10% stop loss, so I would consider this a risky play.  However, if the stock breaks it's resistance at 6.14 and closes higher than it's previous high of 6.25 I'll change my stop loss to a trailing stop of 10% and just hold on, because I can see this stock easily moving to 9-12 before it's next pull back.

<td>How do you read a 10Q?</td>
<td>All publicly traded companies are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to file a quarterly financial statement, known as a 10-Q, for the first three fiscal quarters of the year. Now that the first quarter statements are coming out, what do some of the terms reported on the reports mean?

If you're reading the reports in the newspaper, you probably see a reference to the actual results compared with the analysts' expectations or forecasts. People who track particular companies for financial firms, for example, are constantly monitoring the performance of that company. As the date for the 10-Q approaches, analysts, often after discussions with the company, predict how much a company will make or lose. And woe to the stock price of a company that does worse than analysts expected.

Quarterly reports will tell you what the company's net income (also called net profit) or net loss was during the previous three months. This is how much the company earned after deducting all its expenses--everything from salaries to debt payments to purchase of equipment. This is usually expressed as a big lump sum. Earnings are, very generally speaking, the net income divided per share of stock, and that is usually expressed in cents, or if things are really good, dollars. For example, if a company's quarterly net income was $600,000 and it has 200,000 in common shares, the company's quarterly earnings would be $3 per share. Gross profit or gross margin is the money the company made in sales minus the direct cost incurred. For example, if a company sells $1 million of widgets in a quarter and it cost $250,000 to actually make the widget, the gross profit is $750,000 for the quarter.

Operating income, or loss, is the money the company makes (or loses) doing its business minus the cost incurred doing that business. This is not necessarily the same as net income. A widget company may be lousy at selling widgets (and who isn't?) but great at investing in stocks. So the money made--or lost--by widget manufacturing--the operating income--is separated out from the money made from stock investing in order for investors to see how the company does at its core business. That non-operating income is called--surprise!--non-operating income. Both are calculated in the net income. Sometimes you will see that a company has to account for an extraordinary item or a one-time gain or loss. This is something that is not expected to occur in the normal course of business--for example, the Mississippi overflowing and shutting down a factory, or the costs of eliminating an entire division, or a huge profit made by selling investment stocks.

And what about dividends? Dividends are a portion of income paid per share of stock. For example, if a company's stock is selling at $100 a share and has an annual dividend of $1 per share, the dividend yield is 1 percent. If you're into technology stocks, you aren't getting any dividends. Old economy companies like utilities and financial concerns tend to pay dividends; how much is usually decided by the board of directors. New economy companies--which eat up huge amounts of capital--usually invest profits, if there are any--back into themselves.</td>

one pip is the smallest measure of price move used in forex trading.

The pip is the smallest measure regardless of the fractional representation of the currency exchange rate. Thus, 1.3000 to 1.3010 is the same move in pips terms as 110.00 to 110</td>

More likely, the firm is healthy if it's confident enough to pay out 100+% because it's a very bad idea to lower dividends.  Wall Street tanks the price of any stock that does so, more than the price went up when the company announced the dividends.  Most companies know this, so they're most likely not going to offer a high dividend unless they're confident they can pay it out, which leads to the inference that the company is doing well.</td>

<td>Where does the stock come from when you sell short?</td>
<td>You do borrow shares from someone if you short.  Typically it's the brokerage you are shorting with, who is using the shares of another account holder. If they don't have the shares, they borrow from another firm.  Interesting problems happens when they run out of shares to borrow.  Or even better, the owners of the borrowed shares decide to sell their's.  Often when you want to short in a tight market, brokers will trash your trade while advising "no shares available" so you can't always short when you want, no matter the price you offer. 
  Where do the dividends come from?...your pocket if you are holding the short because you have basically a negative stock.

FYI, there's no reason to hold a short unless you are selling a "covered put"; which will be never.

Most traders buy puts to play the downside of an equity.     
Again: don't ever short a stock. Use puts.

During the past year their net loss was 862 million and its increasing too (albeit not as fast as revenue) and stands at almost 4 times revenue for the past quarter.  It could be 10 years (or never) before these guys make a profit, and they will have to dilute their shares (ie issue more shares to raise cash) before then.

To make matters even worse, their stock price peaked (at almost 8$ per share in early December) and has been trending sharply down since then, so even from a technical point of view they look terrible.

So, we have a fantastic growth rate but utterly terrible fundamentals and technicals, whats to like.

Again, just one opinion.</td>

<td>Does anyone have any good info on ticker symbol: HQSM?</td>
<td>HQ Sustainable Maritime Industries, Inc. principally engages in aquaculture business through co-operative supply arrangements, ocean product harvesting, and processing and sale of farm-bred and ocean harvested aquatic products. It also engages in the production and sale of marine bio-products and healthcare products. The company’s principal products include cross-bred hybrid of tilapia and white-legged shrimp that are exported to the United States, Canada, Japan, and European countries. Its marine bio-products comprise shark cartilage capsule, shark liver oil, and shark liver that are sold principally in People's Republic of China. The company was incorporated in 1989 as Sharon Capital Corporation and changed its name to PEI, Inc. in July 1990. Later, it changed its name to Process Equipment, Inc. in November 1990 and to HQ Sustainable Maritime Industries, Inc. in 2004. HQ Sustainable Maritime Industries is based in Seattle, Washington.

Personally I stay away from OTC stocks but this one is somewhat of a surprise fudamentally because it actually has a positive EPS and a low P/E ratio.  I'm not crazy about the cash/debt ratio, but not exactly shocking on a penny stock, the fact that there is more cash than debt is a positive though. The ROE and ROA are fairly solid, but the negative quarterly revenue growth is a definite negative, as is the negative cash flow.  The other thing that bothers me is I can't find any info on institutional holders... the drivers of heavy volume and price movement.

Technically, most indicators are very bearish, it lept from .12 to .44 last August, traveled erratically to .58 in November and pulled back to .26 in January.  Since then it has traded between .26-.35, climbing to .45 last month before falling back to .30.  It seems to be forming a base and could be heading up, but unless it breaks past it's previous point of .45 I'd stay away because it could easily head the other direction in the next few weeks.  Money Flow, Acc/Dist and MACD are all bearish.  Keep your eye on them though, if the stock starts to move past .45 and the MACD line crosses over and the Acc/Dist and Money flow start moving heavily upward, it could mean the start of a solid impulse wave, and the beginning of some bullish activity, but you'll want to see those indicators starting to act like they did last August.

<td>How do you play the stock market succesfully?</td>
<td>Go to morningstar and look up the weighted average PE ratios of the funds for stock funds and duration for the bond funds.  As most funds underperform the indices over time, treat them as index funds.

For stocks, never hold a fund with a PE over 15.  It works out that unless your expected return is very low, fifteen is a good rule of thumb for discounted cash flows to time 0, as an upper bound for price.  You can take the PE, find the estimated growth of the indices and go to moneychimp.com and estimate return.  Keep tinkering with the growth rate until 1.00 in earnings yields a PE of the same value.

For bond funds, look up the duration and credit quality.  Junk bonds can lose extraordinary amounts in stressful times.  I remember a time in the '90's where one third of junk simply was written off the balance sheets of funds.  In any case, look up the duration.  Figure out the weighting between classes (morningstar should tell you) and go the the Financial Times of London or Barrons or the Wall Street Journal and look up the yield for that approximate duration or average maturity.  That minus the fees will be your yield.

Compare this to your goals.

My guess is that if you do this, you will be in for a shock and be very upset and disappointed.  You might then look at bankrate.com and buy a moneymarket or CD from GMAC Bank or the State Bank of India (member FDIC).  You will likely do better than in the markets.  Prices are high in most funds relative to what they provide.

My checking account at GMAC Bank pays me 4.65% and I am globally among the best investors in the world, from a purely statistical perspective.  Most general public investors are in over their heads but they don't know it.  The professionals don't want to tell people because if you withdrawal your money they get lower fees.

There are not a lot of funds that are reasonably priced compared to their underlying assets, and have a good management history.  I know, I have looked and I am trained to evaluate portfolios.</td>

<td>Question about penny stocks?</td>
<td>You very well may hit a very good returning stock by your method (spread $2000 among 20 random penny stocks), but overall and I guarantee eventually you will fail with that strategy.  My basic question to you on this is, if it were that easy everyone would be doing it, and I guarantee many people have tried this (or a similiar) strategy, and failed.

Anyhow, to answer why this would fail, let me give you some problems you may not have considered.  First off, commissions are very high, just to invest that money into the stocks may run you a few hundred dollars; thats about 10% of your money right there, and you still have to pay commissions on what you sell. ie the first 20% (or something like that) of your gain just goes to paying off commissions.

Also, penny stocks are very, very illiquid, meaning to buy even just $200 of one of them may on its own cause the price to go up.  Thus, for example, you may end up getting half the stock at .01$ and half at .015$ and then watch in horror as the bid price immediately drops back to .01$.  So, your average buy in price was 1.25 cents per share, and the bid now is back to 1 cent per share.  You just lost 1/5th of your money, and remember again that this same thing will happen when you sell.

Finally, remember that stronger companies never enter the world as penny stocks.  They go straight from privately held to IPO's for 10$ per share (or whatever), so to be a penny stock the company probably is a weaker, much riskier company already, hence they do much worse (on average) than regular stocks.

So in summary, I think this strategy may well find you some multi-baggers but you will lose all (or at least most) of your money on most of your other stocks, and overall almost certainly lose money.  Again, if it were that easy, everyone would be doing it.

One last thing though, I really think this is a losing idea, but hey if you don't believe me give it a try anyhow. If you are smart the gained experience may well be worth more than the cost.  So, consider the money you put into this as play money, or tuition money for learning first hand more about how to play the stock market.</td>

Here is the intro to an interview with him:


Eugene Fama grew up in Boston, a third generation Italian-American. While an undergraduate at Tufts University, he excelled in athletics and majored in French—an inauspicious beginning for a future giant in the field of economics. But he also worked for a professor who was trying to develop "buy" and "sell" signals based on price momentum. Although the theories the professor devised worked well when applied to the past, they worked poorly when Fama tested them in real time. That puzzle, plus the skills that he acquired evaluating stock market data, drew Gene Fama to business school. After earning his doctorate at the University of Chicago, he joined the faculty there in 1963.

A simplified version of his dissertation, "Random Walks in Stock Market Prices," was published in Institutional Investor magazine, provoking a stir. It was Gene's article that introduced the still-controversial efficient market theory to the investment community. (There are many variations of the efficient market theory, but they all postulate that stock prices promptly and fully reflect all public information.) Very few academics specializing in investment research have any audience in the investment community, but that article made Gene Fama very well-known on Wall Street.</td>

You will need to have them send you a list of deinquent tax properties and then pick the lien or liens that you what. Send a check with the amount to cover the delinquent lien and then after 1-3 years, depending on the the time frame for that county to have the tax payer make taxes current you will recieve a check with interest. If you have other questions about it email me at the website below, I can tell you a good book to pick up that tells you everything you need to know.</td>

<td>In placing a trade how can I set the trade to happen when the price of the stock is lower? And what it called?</td>
<td>This is called a "limit" trade (which is opposite a "stop", which would mean sell a position if it falls to "x" level).

Your first question/thought should be:  What is my long term goal &amp; what is the "asset allocation" I need to get there?

Spiders &amp; IShares are a great way to invest if it's part of a well thought out plan. Feel free to start with a S&amp;P500 ETF or a all US Market ETF..... but please (for your own sake).... take the next year to read a couple of books that go into investing for retirement.  Make sure they include alot of info of "asset allocation" it is the number one indicator for success for the small investor (#2 is no-load, low fee funds, ETF's and transaction cost). YOU MUST ALWAYS TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE BUYING AND WHY..... 

Good luck!</td>

<td>How to calulate price of 18k gold from 99.9%gold(pure gold)?</td>
<td>The karat value of gold is determined by it's purity. The volume of a piece is divided into 24 parts. If the value is 24k that means 24 of 24 parts are gold. 14k is 14 parts gold and 10 parts some other metal. (copper, silver, etc.)
An 18k piece is 18/24 parts or 75% pure gold so you would take the spot price (592.6 USD in this case) and multiply by .75.
Other properties of the piece can affect it's value. Hallmark, craftsmanship, provenance, or antique value must also be considered and in the case of coins, their mintage. Gold nuggets, especially larger ones, usually fetch well above the spot price.</td>

<td>How do stock exchanges calculate opening price of stocks?</td>
<td>Other exchanges, such as the NASDAQ, Singapore Exchange and Australian Stock Exchange, work on an opening price auction where buyers and sellers are matched electronically.

If the bid overlaps (or exceeds) the ask then that determines the opening price.

eg. A buyer bids $40 to buy a stock before the market opens and a seller asks $39.50 to sell that stock, then the sale goes through at $39.50 on market open.

There are variations between exchanges when there are multiple levels of overlapping bids and asks.  But, effectively, the buyers will never pay more than their bid and the sellers will never receive less than they ask.

Scottrade get the job done too and it is a lot cheap than Fedility or etrade.  Only $7  for a any king of trade, limit order or market order.  No inactivity fees.

A hundred shares of stock costing $2,250 dollars that day would have multiplied into 74,360 shares today, worth over $1.8 million on December 31, 2003. In 1985 McDonald's was added to the 30-company Dow Jones Industrial Average. 


In 1965, with 710 McDonald's spread throughout the nation and 170 million dollars in sales, McDonald's finally blossomed. The company went public and once again Sonneborn did a fine job with the Initial Public Offering (IPO). The stock was priced at 22 dollars each, but by the end of the first day it had already jumped up to 30 dollars and then, shortly after, took off to 49 dollars. Kroc urgently needed the capital to expand rapidly because the company's success had generated many imitators seeking to cash in on the growing industrialization of fast food. 


April 15, 2005
Happy Birthday McDonald's
Happy Birthday McDonald's! The home of the Golden Arches turned 50 today. Ray Kroc opened the first restaurant in Des Plaines, IL; today, there are more than 30,000. If you purchased 100 shares of McD's on the 1965 IPO at $22.50, your investment would be worth $2.4 million today.

<td>when do mutual fund prices get updated?</td>
<td>It depends upon the fund.  Some price hourly, however 99% of firms price their funds at the close of business.  When they release the information is specific to the firm and when it appears is specific to the data provider.  You should presume that any price you see was the close of business the prior day, unless you specifically know otherwise.  Since funds are not designed to daytrade and since funds have strange redemption rules based upon the phrasing of the Investment Company Act, it doesn't matter much because you are pretty much required to sell or buy blind.  

If I buy at noon tomorrow, it will be at the next official price, which is usually close of business and will happen on the following day.  So if the price tonight is 10.13, the real but undisclosed price tomorrow at noon is 10.12 but finishes at 10.14, then I will pay 10.14 the day after tomorrow at the opening of business probably but at some point in the day.

From 8/20/04 to 3/31/06 the return from the S&amp;P is +14.8% - looking at it that way, 10% over 1 year is OK.  You can NOT base information like this in dollars - just percentages.  Its easy to loose sight of things with the mind set - "its only $50".

Go around to the full service banks in your area and ask for the sheet that gives thier CD rates and compare them to each other.  I think the national average is only around 4% right now, but sometimes they have specials.  This'll allow your money to be 'close' to you in the event there is an emergency. Good luck!!

Ensure the diamonds are from a reputable seller that adhere to the Kimberley process (so definitely not conflict diamonds) &amp; that they are accompanied by a full grading certificate from a repuatable lab (for example EGL or GIA) so that when the time comes to resale, you can get the maximum possible for them &amp; sell with confidence. Also make sure they are fully insured &amp; kept safely (i.e. not together as diamonds can scratch each other if not store properly). 

To be honest though, diamonds are only really an investment if you wear them and enjoy them. Although they will appreciate with time, this will take a long long time to see any real dividends so the best pay off of all is if you really enjoy the diamonds and their beauty! Hope this helps!</td>

Markets do not work this way, in practice, and this is the main reason Marxist economic doctrine failed. To each according to his need is a great concept but some people cannot work and represent no productivity and others are extremely productive, far beyond any need they would ever have in a thousand years. With no market to balance outputs you have a system bound for disaster like the former Soviet Union.

A doctor who earns a lot of money and does research that eventually created jobs by way of new technologies and techniques can afford to pay higher taxes as do the people who win new employment because of his research, to help  pay the cost of the care for the individual who is not productive, say because he or she is disabled.

Even in a seriouly distressed situation, like drought or famine, markets can come to the aid of the suffering region because some elements of the market will have surplusses. Also in this day, there are no real famines because transportation can get any amount of food to any point on the globe in little time therefore the real issue is politics and culture not economics.

But to trade any stocks, whether U.S. or foreign, you want an account with a broker, such as Ameritrade or Scottrade, not with a bank normally.  A lot of banks do have some ability to offer brokerage services, but they're usually not the best resources for that.</td>

<td>which industry will prosper more, oil sands or ethanol?</td>
<td>Ethanol
 Actually Ethanol has a very positive outlook in  the next 24-36 mos.I won't go into this too deep,but the premise is this: 
 It's obvious the world is in a pickle concerning energy demand versus energy output.Free world governments are already making the move to improve emissions,(already done in automobiles for the most part),and find alternatives.Big business for the 1st time in decades are thinking "green",so there's a favorable climate for profit in the near term.Developing countries as they prosper are increasing pressure on supply.(Did you know the Chinese have their own "World Trade Center"? It's only @50 stories tall though.)
 Enter alternative/substitute fuels. OIL SANDS are costly to develop, and not expected to be on-line for years; hence no product/no profit.Ethanol however;is being introduced to a wide national market right now, and is close to being blended with gasoline with a 10-15% cut per Gal.Currently there isn't enough ethanol(I didn't beleive it either!), so it is being imported from S.America. Ethanols dark side is the cost of insurance and distribution.Here in N.Y., ethanol is cut about 10% in about 1/3 of the supply chain at present.There are facilities being built at refineries now that will "cut" your gasoline with ethanol at the refinery.(I was lucky enough to by chance meet an engineer who was over-seeing an installation here).
 OIL sands do have a positive side: that being  the Chinese have a speculative interest in the Canadian fields.</td>

What you can do is buy call, buy put..that's known as a stradle.  So you can benefit from upside or downside movement.  The key is to find a stock that likes to move a lot (GOOG =D )

You need to get set up with an account with a bank or a brokerage house.

You can also buy and sell mutual funds this way as well.

I haven't done it this way myself but I know a few people who do.
I like to use the telephone for stocks and go into a bank or an invetment broker for mutal funds.

Be carefull with the stock market because you can lose a lot of money if you don't know what you are doing.

I am no expert by any means but I do know that most people including me do not know when it is time to sell a stock.

If it's going up everyone wants to keep it and make a lot of money.
If it's going down everyone thinks it will stop going down and come back up but that is not always the way it works.

From what I have read but haven't done most of the time is that you should always pick a price that if your stock gets to,you should sell it.
If for example you buy one at $20 per share and it drops to $15 or $16 then you should sell it and take your loss rather than watch it go even lower.

If it goes up to the figure you have picked like maybe $30 per share then sell it and take your profit.
If it goes higher after you sell it you just have to be satisfied that you made some money because no one knows for sure how high it will go before it starts to come down.

3.   Take a year to learn. As you're learning you can invest the money in an S&amp;P500 ETF or go to Vanguard for the S&amp;P500 Index Fund. (Open the IRA at Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, etc). Do this until you're ready to diversify. Although the China/Asian fund may be a good idea... it's not the place to start!

Another thing to invest in is perhaps furthering your education and moving on to a higher paying job.  Investing in yourself.

<td>What is the best way to go in BId and Ask in Investing?</td>
<td>That's a really wide spread.  It might not be a very liquid stock so that's why the spread is higher.  If there was more interest, then the spread would close up a little bit.  The bid matters because that's what you'll get if you cross the market and sell stock.

Last is the last price that an actual trade occured at.  Since the last is much closer to the ask, it's possible that someone did a lot of selling and new bidders haven't had time to put in their bids yet.

Market order means the broker can use any price he wants, theoretically, but it's in their best interests not to give too bad of a price or else the broker will lose future business, so generally, they won't rip you off more than a few cents off the spread.  Limit orders really aren't that much better for saving money because you just have to wait until your price hits the other side anyway.  It's more a convenience feature so that you get a certain price for sure and don't have to watch the market all the time.</td>

But most people spend more time deciding the color of their new car, than they do on a mutual fund advisor, for example. 

Are you really wanting to do this yourself, or are you asking about someone who is an expert who can do it for you?

If you invest in the stock market right now, or just buy into all the ETF's you can afford, it's a crap shoot, like rolling the dice, and the odds are probably not in your favor, whether you have an expert fund manager or not, because mutual funds are always "in" the market.

They say "Buy and Hold" for the long term is better, but that depends on when you get in, and what your definiton of "long term" is. 

The Dow is now approaching all-time highs last seen in Jan 2000, so if your long-term definition is more than seven years, then you won't mind waiting another seven years for a profit.

In my opinion, the name of the game is capital preservation. When the risks are high, like right now, you get out of the stock and bond markets and park your cash in a interest bearing money market fund or CD or Treasury Bill.

This is simply not a good entry point for investors. Be patient, wait a few months, and you'll be able to buy much more stock a lot cheaper, the risks will be lower (even though they will seem higher), and your chance of success greater.

If you wish to research the “Buy and Hold Strategy” further, or perhaps trade yourself, I recommend two book titles. One is called "Which Is Better, Buy-and-Hold or Market Timing?" The other is "Do You Have What It Takes to Be a Market Timer?" They will give you plenty to think about.</td>

<td>what is the problem of investment in developing countries?</td>
<td>The problem is the same with all investment.  There is the risk that you will lose some or all of your money.  Developing countries are especially high-risk in this regard because they frequently have political turmoil which could lead to the government (or pseudo-government) seizing/stealing your property.  Also, developing countries tend to have higher poverty and weak law enforcement, so your property is at risk for vandalism, destruction, or theft by criminals.

The solutions depend on how you actually plan to invest.  If you will be lending money to locals to establish a business, charge an appropriately high rate and do not put all of your money into one venture.  The rate must be high enough to offset your risk, but low enough to be affordable to your debtors.

If you intend to actually go into the country and establish a business, you must pay close attention to the security of your assets.  Do not expect the government to protect your property, and do not expect them to keep their word - even if it's in writing.  You must have adequate security to defend your property, and secrecy to hide as much as you can in case your defenses fail.

It is NOT easy to overcome those problems, which is why there is not more investment in developing countries.  It's really a bummer because investment and economic growth are precisely what are needed to stabilize the systems.</td>

<td>Looking for Investors!!!!! Where can I find??</td>
<td>I know that you are not going to like this answer, but the truth is that you will simply not be able to find an investor until you have done a LOT of work beforehand (think the equivalent amount of work to writing perhaps 100,000 lines of code...seriously). Investors have many, many options as to where to invest their money, from public companies like Google, to hedge funds and other professionally-managed vehicles, to early stage companies.

However, no matter how much of a "killer app" YOU think you have, it won't attract an investor until THEY themselves are convinced that it is a killer app, AND that you are the person who can make a success of the business. At the very, very least this would require a carefully thought out, comprehensive business plan (thirty or so pages), detailing exactly how your business would work, what needs the product would solve, who would buy it and how much they would pay, what the market for the product is, who the competition is, detailed background on your management team showing that they have previously run successful companies...and much, much more.

A good place for you to start putting all this together is an excellent book called "The E-Myth Revisited", which will step you through the path of changing your thought process from being a paid computer engineer to being a risk-taking, entrepreneurial company builder. I've included a link to Amazon below, which will take you right to the book.

<td>What is more valuable: a portfolio of options or a option on a portfolio? Why?</td>
<td>The question is a bit more complex than one might think.  There are quite a number of factors to consider here.  

To begin, a portfolio of options presents its own unique set of risks that the investor would need to understand very thoroughly.  Primary sources of exposure include volatility, time and changes in the underlying asset prices. The level of exposure to each of these sources is continuously in a state of flux, so the investor has to have a meaningful degree of efficiency in holding options as investments.  In this day and age, a great deal of knowledge can be acquired on the web: www.chartbender.com is a great source for options knowledge.

With stock, on the other hand, your primary exposure is to changes in the prices of the equities themselves, with modest exposure to time in terms of interest expenses (e.g., the money tied up in the stock investments is not earning the risk-free rate of interest).

So, while a portfolio of options may give you more risk control, if you don't yet have the skills to exercise that control, then it could end up proving to be a less valuable scenario.  Conversely, with a little knowledge, bringing options into your portfolio can produce incredibly meaningful benefits.

As for using an index option to hedge a portfolio of equities, this can be viable.  However, you would want to be confident that a) the value of your portfolio was sufficiently correlated to the index whose option you are using for the hedge, and that b) this correlation would remain largely in tact should the portfolio move sharply against you causing the hedge to be needed. 

Hope this has been helpful.

<td>how do i become rich?</td>
<td>First: Work on having the wealth builders mind-set. You have to believe that you will become a financially secure "rich" person and never doubt yourself. It all begins in your mind.

Second: Become financially literate. Education is the key. Learn how to make money, mange it and grow it.  Rich people know how to make money and grow it...that's why they are "rich".

Third: Plan on becoming a business owner and an investor someday and NOT work as an employee. How many "rich employees" do you know?  

Fourth: Make a hobby out of becoming rich because its going to take a lot of time, work, money and effort. How many lazy people do you know who are rich? So make the whole process a hobby and have fun with it.

Fifth: Become rich for the right reason. Like to take care of your family and to be able to help others who are in need. knowing that you may someday have the financial means to help others will help keep you motivated. 

Read books and listen to audio tapes that are published by people who are wealthy business owners and investors. They give you direction, valuable information and tips.  Start with the basics...Robert Kiyosaki's "Rich Dad Poor Dad" and read all of his other books. Read or listen to the audio book Millionaire Next Door by Thomas J Stanley.  Also, read bios on wealthy people like Warren Buffet and Donald Trump.  

Wealth building information is actually free online and offline. All of the books and audio books that I've listed on this post are best sellers so most can be found at public libraries. 

Being a "rich" person, "middle-class" person or a "poor" person is simply a reflection of whats going on in your mind. Change your mind-set and you change your life. 

Answer this question..."What really separates rich people from the poor and middle-class?  Answer: Their mind-set. 

Rich people are really no different from anyone else. They just used their "mind"  and do what's required to make a lot of money. The broke and middle-class use their minds to look for jobs and follow employee manuals. 

I'm a business developer and I help people start their own internet business. You can contact me if you want to start your own business online. I can help you with the process.

If you want to make a lot of money on the market you got to do your own research.  Think about it,  if the subscriptions are that hot why do they tell other people about it?  I am a licensed adviser and I have seen too many people looking for the short cut and after being disappointed a few times quit the market all together.  I would recommend you to look at some thing like the Motley Fools or IBD and look at what they like and why they like what they like and then do your own research on the company or fund managers.  When you buy a fund you are betting on the management's ability to beat the market, that is all.  Another thing, this I learned myself after thousands of dollars worth of market lessons.  Don't try to time the market.  There are to many factors that we do not control.  The consistent way to beat the market is through figuring out the fundamentals and let time do the growing for you.  Market timing and refusing to cut loses are two sure way to decimate your portfolio.  So be careful and do your research before sinking your hard earned dollars.</td>

<td>What are Credit Derivatives ?</td>
<td>(m)

A credit derivative is an OTC derivative designed to transfer credit risk from one party to another. By synthetically creating or eliminating credit exposures, they allow institutions to more effectively manage credit risks. Credit derivatives take many forms. Three basic structures include: 

credit default swap: Two parties enter into an agreement whereby one party pays the other a fixed periodic coupon for the specified life of the agreement. The other party makes no payments unless a specified credit event occurs. Credit events are typically defined to include a material default, bankruptcy or debt restructuring for a specified reference asset. If such a credit event occurs, the party makes a payment to the first party, and the swap then terminates. The size of the payment is usually linked to the decline in the reference asset's market value following the credit event. 

total return swap: Two parties enter an agreement whereby they swap periodic payment over the specified life of the agreement. One party makes payments based upon the total return—coupons plus capital gains or losses—of a specified reference asset. The other makes fixed or floating payments as with a vanilla interest rate swap. Both parties' payments are based upon the same notional amount. The reference asset can be almost any asset, index or basket of assets. 

credit linked note: A debt instrument is bundled with an embedded credit derivative. In exchange for a higher yield on the note, investors accept exposure to a specified credit event. For example, a note might provide for principal repayment to be reduced below par in the event that a reference asset defaults prior to the maturity of the note. 

The fundamental difference between a credit default swap and a total return swap is the fact that the credit default swap provides protection against specific credit events. The total return swap provides protection against loss of value irrespective of cause—a default, market sentiment causing credit spreads to widen, etc.</td>

Your idea must be a proven product with a proven market that is growing.

Your plan must be realistic, achievable and show you've done your homework.

Your executive team, including yourself, has to be the best.

If you satisfy the three requirements above, you get... a brief meeting with the investors.

That's when the fun begins. They will drill you until they find out all the key success factors of your business / industry. Then, they will convert all the information you give them into a probability of success.

Depending on the odds of success, they will invest the appropriate amount of funds. Read by blogzine below, especially the posting on "Kelly's optimal investment equation," for details.

Venture capital is normally thought of as an investment in a start-up business.  Generally, new companies look for venture capital when they are early stage and do not have access to catpial markets.

Private equity on the other hand does not have to be early stage money.  It is money invested in companies in pretty much all stages.  (You read about private equity companies taking public companies private, for example).

They are not going to go after the taxpayer 300,000,000 because even if they find he has not paid enough taxes what are they going to take away from him if he is broke.

<td>You're probably referring to advisors who recommend converting to cash "instruments," or cash equivalents. 

If someone were in stocks, or advising someone in stocks, they would just advise selling the stocks.

So the question is probably directed at mutual fund investors, who may be in baskets of several underlying investments, whether stocks, bonds, real estate plays, or whatever. 

The advice refers to these types of investors to sell out of their current investments, and buy into money market accounts or T-Bills, or CD's, or some other form of liquid cash instrument, but not cash itself, which is not interest bearing.</td>

If you are begginer investoer you probably want S&amp;P ETF (SPDR) or an Index fund that reflects S&amp;P 500. 
If you are begginer futures trader then minis are good for you but then you need to guess which way you think index is going.  Minis are more commonly used to leverage your position in the index.  And remember futures work different then options.  In futures if you think price will fall you buy, and if you think price will rise you sell.  (kind of like shorting)

<td>How mutual funds are different from shares? Which one is good &amp; secure in terms of investment?</td>
<td>When you buy mutual funds, you are not buying stock in just one company. A Mutual Fund takes your money and combines it with other investors money to buy bulk lots of stock. Usually the funds are divided into low risk, moderate risk and aggresive funds. The lower the risk fund the more they diversify into safer bonds and large companies. The more aggresive the fund means that you are investing in smaller companies, but the chance for greater fund growth comes with these smaller companies, as well as more risk. Look in a newspaper and find the name of some mutual funds that have the letters nl. These are "no load" funds, which means you don't have to pay a broker fee to invest in them. Request an information package from the fund. It is much safer than buying individual stock.</td>

<td>What's the best way of consistenly making money on the stockmarket ?</td>
<td>Know what you're doing while you're investing.  Too many people just buy and hope for the best, and buy and hold strategies are inefficient to say the least.

IMHO, you should start by learning how to invest, determining WHAT to buy through Fundamental Analysis and determining WHEN to buy with Technical Analysis. 

I firmly believe that to get the clearest picture about any stock, and to determine whether you're actually going to invest in it, it's best to do your own research and adapt a system that meets your investment needs, style and risk level.  There are many stocks ripe for the picking just about at any time if you know how and where to look. 

Start with Investors.com, it's William O'Neil's online version of Investors Business Daily.  The How To Invest section is the best place to start learning the importance of Fundamentals and the basics of Technical Analysis.   The site has the IBD 100, a cross index list of the market leaders, the Stock Checkup, a great tool for checking fundamentals on any stock, and articles and analysis of stocks and general market conditions.  They also run various screens every day which in addition to the other lists, (IBD100, New America, stocks under $10, CANSLIM select, ect) are very helpful for finding investment ideas with solid Fundementals that are ready to move.  The CANSLIM method alone is a very successful and popular trading system, but I prefer to use a combination of Fund &amp; Tech Analysis, rather that just the rating system alone. 

From there you can move on to more detailed study of Technical Analysis. 

Start with StockCharts.com, they have an excellent free Chart School which helpfully explains various chart patterns and Technical Indicators and overlays.  Pay particular attention to the Chart Patterns section, and make sure you learn about Zig Zag patterns, Bollinger Bands, Moving Average, Volume, RSI, the MACD (Mac-D), The Williams %er, Stochastics, and the Chaikin Money Flow.  Sounds complicated, but when you start chart reading you'll want about a half a dozen or so of these overlays and indicators.  I personally rely heavily on the ZIG-ZAG, MACD, Chaikin Money Flow, Volume, Moving Average and RSI. 

StockTA.com is also an excellent Technical Analysis site, with charted Fibonacci resistance and support lines and will tell you if the stock is bullish or bearish in the short, medium and long run.  The site also has an extensive Candle Pattern Glossary and a fantastic technical screener. 

The above sites do have premium services, but all the services I mentioned are free.  After you've absorbed some of the Technical information, do some reading on Fibonacci numbers and Elliot Wave theory, there are good links in the "School" section of StockTA.com.  I've been using Elliot Wave and Fibonacci's to help refine my in and out points.  StockCharts.com's "ZigZag" overlay helps me plot and count the waves and that helps determine where I am in the overall pattern. 

So basically I'll find interesting stocks through the screens on Investors.com or StockTA.com, run them through the Stock Checkup at Investors.com, if they measure up I'll run them through the Analyisis &amp; Fib Analysis at StockTA.com and do an extensive chart study, examining the 2 yr, 1 yr, 6 mth, 3 mth, 1 mth &amp; 5 day.  I'll also do my due dilligence, studying the profile, key statistics, headlines, etc. through Yahoo Finance and web searches.  If it all measures up and the stock is in a base or in a pull back and it's starting a wave 1 or wave 3, it's time to buy.  I'm usually looking for 15-30% during run ups, I'll get out during pullbacks and either move on to another stock I've been tracking that is ripe, or wait for the pullback to recover and get back in.  Remember, the idea is not to lose money, so letting your money sit there during a pull back wastes both time and money and neither can be squande</td>

I assume a similar event can occur with drill pipe that is vibrated by its constant rotation while drilling. It seems reasonable to me but I'm sure the magnetization level is very low.

<td>How does venture capitalism work?</td>
<td>Generally, venture capital is funding given to early stage (start up) companies.  The funding is used to finance the operations of the company until it reaches the point where it can either fund it's own operation through sales, can be purchased by a mature company, or becomes large enough to seek public capital through an issuing of stock (IPO).  

Introductions to venture investors are made through formal and informal networking of individuals within and outside of the profession. If you wish to attract venture capital you should develop a 'pitch' that includes a targeted business plan.  There are websites devoted to helping people develop these plans (see sources below).  Some potential sources of VC contacts-  talk with anyone and everyone you know with in your industry of interest, alumni networks either of your school or the schools of your industry, or the schools venture capitalists attend (think top MBA programs), some angel investors, business schools and venture firms sponsor 'pitch nights' where just about anyone can present their business plan for review.

The interest of an angel or VC investor in your plan will depend on the potential of your idea.  Some simple questions a VC asks- will it make money? will it make enough money to justify the investment in it?  is the idea patentable?  is the ides defendable or easily copied by others? is this an attractive industry?  is this an attractive business relative to our other investments?</td>

<td>Is anybody getting nervous about the stock market with the coming World war?  Would buying gold be smart??</td>
<td>I have spent 13 years as a financial planner and am now retired at the ripe age of 34. I managed over 105 million in assets to give you some perspective on my answer. Gold can be every bit as volatile as the market. For instance, look at what gold has done in the past year or so, the movement in the stock is a refection on the perception of what is happening both in the world as well as the economy. If perception changes about either of those 2 items, gold will plunge and your "safe" non correlated asset won't be as safe as you orinally thought. Gold hasn't been a viable investment option for nearly 60 years. If you are panicked about the coming war then seek out defense companies like Lockheed or Northrup Grumman. Both of these types of stocks are good if such an event takes place but they are also good fundamental stocks. As with all investments though, cirumstances change rapidly and most lay-men investors lack the emotional fortitude to do what is right with there investment money. My advice is that if you are concerned with the direction of the market, then dont get into it. With rates as high as they have gone recently, there are some great fixed rates out there to ride out this storm. And consider that if rates should fall then the price of fixed income securities actually goes up. The key in any investment portfolio is BALANCE. Cash equivelants, stocks, and fixed income are the 3 general investment types. Some of the more sophisticated investors also utilize real estate. Depending on how much money you have to invest, there are other alternatives too.</td>

<td>How to measure a company's intangible value?</td>
<td>Intangible value comes from things such as goodwill, patents, trademarks, and customer lists.  The problem with valuation is that these assets can be hard to identify and the value they create or distroy is really really tough to measure.  In general, the value of an intangible asset is the value of the firm with the asset less the value of the firm without the asset...clear as mud?  Ok...some helpful things, then.

If you take a market approach, simply take the Value of the Firm (both debt and equity) and subtract out the value of all tangible assets.

A bottoms up approach would require a fundamental analysis of the asset, just as if it were like any other asset.  A DCF model can help out here.

Either way you do it, the process is not exact, can be very expensive, and extremely time consuming to do right.  Good luck.</td>

here you can invest money to earn 10% a month compounded! This was my sons only hope to buy a house these days. After testing with 100.00 it works, and invest more, four different options, all 10% amonth, "ofshore investing".
Examples of compounding: 1000.00 after one year: 3130.00.

To give you an idea, the dollar went off the gold standard back in the 1970's has has been getting printed like anything. If the dollar went back on the gold standard, it would take $52,000.00 being destroyed to be replaced with each ounce of gold (going rate for an ounce of gold is about $620.00 USD).

Also, countries like China, which ownes about 30% of U.S. debt) is growing like crazy. Invest in developing countries.

However, higher oil prices are here to stay and may continue to rise along with consumption. China, with the largest pop. in the world, is trading in bicycles for cars.  Their consumption alone has recently grown to #2, surpassing Japan and Europe. Ford is #3 in sales of hybrids right now, behind Toyota and Honda.  They may become #2 in the next few years.  Where do you think the trend in automobile sales will go in the next few years?  Remember, as an oligopoly, the financial barriers to entry are high, so both may remain in business for years to come.  Who's plan looks best?  My money likes Ford.</td>

<td>why Intel looses market share against AMD?</td>
<td>This is an interesting question. The microprocessor market is actually composed of two different purchasing processes. and Intel has focused on one and "forgotten" the other.

The first is the "Integrator" market, composed of PC Brnad  manufacturers (lead by Dell, Lenovo, HP, etc.) 

To reach this segment Intel has negociated exclusivity deals, with the idea that if they secure their leadership by locking up the brands, the consumers will eventually purchase Intel systems indifferent to what ever the competition offers. They first used this strategy to drive cyrix (developer of the 586 and 686 chips) out of business in the late 1990s. 

The second segment is the consumer, Intel has focused on branding rather than performance by using names such as Pentium, and Centrino, In short by focusing on large deals with the manufacturer and a good brandname, they have left behind superior technological design.

Strangely, Intel has not lost as much market share as it seems, Their technology placement agreements for 2007 and 2008 still leave them as number 1 with manufacturers. For every AMD system offered on the open marhet there will be 1.7 Intel systems offered. 

Since consumers purchase after the manufacturers´ agreements, it takes a time delay before manufacturers can actually see a shift in purchase preferences.

That is why the gap in market share is more visible in  Servers and specialty built systems and less visible in mainstream equipment such as laptops.

The sad thing is that it looks like intel will continue to follow this strategy, leaving the consumer in second place for as long as they can ride the "preference gap" by sweetening the deals to Manufacturers (see the case of Apple dual cores)</td>

<td>is there any low investments i can start to save money for my future?</td>

I have included a link through Yahoo finance showing funds of that nature that are rated better than average by Moringstar. Yahoo sometimes does not provide correct information so you need to use this as a starting point and research a little furture. 

Another way is to open an on line brokerage account and buy shares directly in good solid companies that have a good track record and pay dividend that have tended to increase over time, such as BAC, for example. But that is more risky without having at at least 5 and preferably 10 different stocks in your portfolio to reduce the risk of a piece of bad news causing disaster. You also have the option of buying exchange traded index funds. That is an inexpensive method to participate in general market trends. I personally do not like the idea, but a lot of people do.</td>

3. Warn about how this should not lead to any ideas that deficits are good and start with the debt management issue.
4. Go deeper on the budget thing by showing the relation of debt to: interest rate and employment.
5. conclude with the current view that budgets are only a tool, and if used wisely can help foster an economy blah blah blah...

If you are not into fiscal thingy (or if you are more into international affairs), take the same deficit idea but with TRADE deficit. You can basically use the same approach to both deficits.

<td>is it better to invest in mutual funds or individual stocks for a long period of time?</td>
<td>a mutual fund is you paying some one to trade your stocks for you, keep a hugely diversified portfolio, (like 100-200 different stocks) and basically try not to lose your money. Mutual funds try to beat the market, but the problem is they manager gets paid no matter what, if he takes the whole fund to Zero, he still gets his paycheck. 

You're far better off doing your homework and buying your own portfolio of 10-15 best of breed stocks. btu that takes commitment, you have to be able to stay on top of financial news that can affect stock price and therefore affect your investment. Cramer reccommends at least an hour per stock per week.

If you really wanna get the best of both approaches, you should go for index funds. the S&amp;P 500 has long been the standard by which the strength of the market is measured. A number of other companies have their own 500 index funds, which allocate investment by how good a performer the company is. if i were looking for a relatively safe investment ( read: NO INVESTMENT IS SAFE. but Riskier = Rewardier) i would set up a portfolio of 5-10 index funds, with a third in 100, a third in 500 and the rest in 1000 funds.</td>

<td>You probably cannot find this out.  Shareholder lists are not public information, but can be made available to existing shareholders.  However, a shareholder needs to have a reason, such as a proxy fight, in order to get them.  To do that, you need to put up an enormous amount of money and have a reason to try and take over a company.

It is perfectly legal for someone to do business with a firm they also own and of course they would want the price to go up.  They would be nuts to want it to go down.

It could potentially be unethical, but it certainly isn't illegal.  Now it could violate her contractual obligations to her employer, but only if the employer has such a policy, it is part of her contract and is materially detrimental to the firm.

This is how capitalism works, everyone works in their own self interest and as a result we have gone from a near starvation economy to an economy where very few people farm or provide basic services and mostly live in luxury.

<td>Who sets the stock price each day? Is it a person or an automated system?</td>
<td>The NYSE is a bit more ancient.  I don't know if they still use this system or not, but they have specialists for a given stock.  More popular traded stocks may have multiple specialists, and a specialist might take a bunch of thinly traded stocks.  Usually, brokers are the ones placing orders to the specialist and the specialist will match up the buyers and the sellers and take a cut.  They might have gone electronic by now.  The specialist works for the stock exchange and pays a large fee for a seat on the exchange.

The NASDAQ is a fully automated computer system.  The tons of brokers instead of talking to the specialist just input their orders.  The array of buy and sell orders form the bid/ask.  When there's a match, the trade executes by computer.</td>

<td>why interest rates go up?</td>
<td>I'm sure an Econ person is way more qualified than I to answer this question but it deals with supply and demand.

The cost of lending money (as in rising interest rates) makes less people borrow it which means that there will be less people buying goods and services which keeps inflation in check.

The more it costs banks to lend money by borrowing from the federal reserve, the more they have to charge people who take out loans to recoup that costs.  This means that the price point for borrowing money is higher meaning less people will borrow money because they have to pay back more.

In the grand scheme of things, this makes business keep their prices in check and not raise them as high as they would like.</td>

<td>Has anyone ever had any luck investing in Penny Stocks? What is a good Penny Stock to invest in?</td>
<td>I have said this too many times already. Don't ask people for investing recomendations. Only trust yourself. You need to devise your own investing strategy. 

I have traded penny stocks before and I have had very profitable positions before. 

some things to look out for: 

Penny stocks tend to be more risky and thus tend to offer the potential for quicker and higher returns.  Although one problem with penny stocks are that you need to keep and eye on bid/ask sizes and average volumes as criteria to definatly include in your strategy, unless you are investing less than say 5k, more than that and you may have a substantial price effect from buying or selling, so keep and eye on the sizes. Also used limit order for sure, you don't want to put in an order then have the price jump 10%+ so that when you buy you overdraw your account, in which case you will need to come up with the additional funds before selling.</td>

<td>Which is the best bond investment?</td>
<td>Personally I wouldn't invest in bonds right now, as I think rates are going up.  But if I was going to invest for maybe a term of two years, I might consider bonds.  

For you, you need to decide how much risk you want to take.  Government bonds (US Treasurys of UK Gilts) are pretty much riskless if you invest in your own currency and hold them to maturity.  Corporate bonds will normally yield more, and some yield WAY more.  But these corporate bonds are also WAY riskier, which is why you get more interest paid to you.

If you know a company very, very well, you might consider investing in their bonds.  Otherwise best to stay in shorter term governments, in my opinion.</td>

I think now I understand the markets much better.

Since I am in a similar position as you are, just 1 year ahead studing :) , I would strongly recommend you to start by studing Profr. Peter Navarro's material. First I studied his audio course "Big picture investing", and read his books "when is raining in Brazil buy Starbucks", "when the markets move will you be ready?" and now i'm reading his most recent book "the well timed strategy", for me it was great to start with the audio course, since he explains the basics to understand the market, and it comes with a very didactic printed course guide. Profr. Navarro has been a great teacher for me, I don't think there are other books as good as this for a beginer, and belive me, i've done my research and been reading a lot!! after the audio course i was able to understand and take more "juice" from his books and other books that I have read, I recommend you to do the same thing.

Regarding the Can Slim system teached by IBD's Bill O'Neal, I think he is a real master, his investing approach is great and relatively easy to follow if you use the investing tools on investors bussiness daily and do your research homework every day, actually, I just took the Can Slim Level I Seminar some weeks ago, and I am already subscribed for the level II seminar to be held at the end of this month, BUT, if i hadn't studied Profr. Navarro's material before, I am shure I would understanded much less from the can slim seminar, so I recomend you to start with Profr. Peter Navarro's material, its great material and has been a lot of help for me.

You can find Profr. Navarro's audio courses and books at barnes and noble, either in the book store or online, is not an expensive material, i would have pay 10 times its price, its worth much more.

And, once you start to study, the learning curve never ends!! start with Prof. Navarro, before you buy any material much more expensive and not worth its price, belive me i've done it :(..im shure you will thank me.

Good luck!!!</td>

<td>Wondering if Universal Life Insurance is a good investment vehicle for my young sons?</td>
<td>Absolutely not. Why?
1) Your investment may not be meeting your needs.
2) Your investments can be used to pay the premiums (that's why premiums are flexible).
3) If you want to use your investment for personal use, you have to BORROW the money and pay it back!
4) If you want to use your investments without having to pay it back, you would have to cancel it.
5) In the event of your death, all your investments you put into the life insurance are kept by the company (unless it is stated in the policy).

Since your sons are 18 and 20, they are old enough to start their own investments. If they are working, they can start a ROTH IRA. Roth IRA are tax-deferred investments, so any capital gains and dividends are reinvested without taxes. And when they become 59 1/2 years old, anything they take out of the IRA is tax-free! Since they are young, they should invest in aggressive growth funds. So far, the best performing mutual fund in the past 25 years has been Legg Mason Partners Aggressive Growth Fund (symbol SHRAX for Class A, SAGBX for Class B). It has earned an average rate of 14%.

Anyway, I would get rid of Universal Life and get term insurance. Why Term? 
1) Premiums are inexpensive and you can get the maximum coverage available.
2) You can invest your money in a different investment vehicle (such as IRAs, 401k, variable annuities, mutual funds).
3) As you get older, you will have less financial obligations to pay (like mortgages and credit cards and loans), so you don't need as much coverage when its time to renew your term.
4) As your investments grow and it grows above your coverage amount, you probably don't need life insurance anymore.

Anyway, I don't know your relationship with the agent who sold you your life insurance, but the main reason why he sold you Universal Life is because he/she gets paid huge commissions on it as compared to selling Term. You should ask the life agent what kind of life policy does he/she own. More likely he/she owns term (if he/she doesn't have any, then there's no reason to do business with him/her).</td>

A very simple example would be that a pump stopped and water was no longer being supplied. It appears that the pump is the problem. But using RCFA and the process, you may find that instead of the pump needing to be replaced for hundreds of thousands of dollars, it was a pressure sensor which was faulty which signaled to the pump to shut down. The sensor may only cost hundreds of dollars and by replacing it with the right sensor, the problem doesn't happen again.</td>

<td>VATreasures gave you a good answer on this one. You can have as many IRA accounts as you would like or as many as you can afford. Just wanted to comment on what apg2000 wrote. The not keeping your eggs all in one basket is meant to refer to portfolio diversification not the number of places you have accounts. Investments at banks are FDIC insured and investments with brokers are SIPC insured so risk of losing your investment if the financial institution goes under is low. If you have and IRA account at three different banks and have CDs in all three accounts, then you portfolio is not diversified and you are still putting all your eggs in one basket. Portfolio diversification means spreading you money out over stocks, bonds, money markets, etc. It is actually better to keep as few IRA accounts as you can because most institutions charge a custodian fee and having multiple accounts will lead to multiple fees.

Now that you've narrowed things down a bit, ask friends or visit open houses and find a good realtor in your area.  Find an experienced one (usually, they will have been in business for a number of years and do it full time).  Now that you have a good realtor, work with them.

<td>what is the nature of risk in property?</td>
<td>On a very generic basis, I believe the two greatest risks are:  

1.  Illiquidity - Liquidity is the ability to convert an asset to cash at a reasonable price in a short period of time.  If you need to sell for any reason, it's probably won't be a quick procees, unless you are willing to take a signficant discount to market price.  Sell a bond or a stock, you have your cash the next business day.

2.  Cost to carry - interest on mortgage, property taxes, maintenance, insurance, etc.  While time will bail you out of most real estate investments, will you be able to handle the carrying costs under adverse conditions?  Many a real estate developer and/or investor has lost their shirt because they found they could not afford the cost of carry during a period of illiquidity.</td>

<td>Investment strategy?</td>
<td>The discrepency between forward and trailing P/E is not an indicator of whether a stock is undervalued or not.  Trailing P/E is Price/last 12 months earnings while forward P/E is Price/next 12 months earnings.  Each of these time periods are independent of one another and cannot be compared.  A better method may be to look at forward P/E for your stock versus the industry average forward P/E over time.  It is important to look at a time series of data to determine what is normal for the industry and how your target firm relates to the industry average.  

Be careful when using relative valuations like this for long term investment decisions.  Some firms are priced relatively higher or lower than an industry based on their earnings for a reason.  Typically, the market values the quantity of earnings (captured in the P/E) and the quality of the earnings (not captured in the P/E).  The quality of the earnings relates to the riskiness of the earnings.  Actually, to be technically correct, the market values cash flows, which may or may not relate to earnings.  Earnings can be manipulated by management to make a firm appear stronger or more stabile than it truly is.  Over the last few years, there have been many examples of firms going under and upper management being tried for earnings manipulation.  

I am an advocate of the Discounted Cash Flow approach, but if you are interested in relative valuation and strategies that are based on multiples, Aswath Damodaran (professor at NYU) has some really good texts talking about taking an economic approach to price multiples.  Another good text is "Security Analysis on Wall Street" by Hooke.

Some other multiples that you may be interested in are the PEG ratio (P/E divided by growth), market-to-book (became very popular in the 80's), and Price/Sales (good for valuing start-ups, tech firms, and many service firms).  Keep in mind that while a ratio may hold well in terms of valuation for one industry, it may not hold well for other industries.  Additionally, within an industry, differences in firms' capital structure, revenue recognition, depreciation methodologies, capitalization policies, and off-balance sheet financing may force you to restate ratios in order to make them comparable and relevant.</td>

<td>Garmin (GRMN) just hit a 52-week high.  Should I ring the register?</td>
<td>The first thing you should do is prevent a robbery from cleaning out the register.  You can do that by placing a stop order beneath the current price. IMHO, first support looks like around $80. Your stop should go in a little beneath that, in case the support level doesn't hold the decline. Stop at $78.  That's 12% below today's close.  That's your insurance in case the stock gets pummeled. I was around in '87, '98 and '00, it can happen and here's why.  Using the PEG ratio, the price to book ratio, the price to sales ratio; the stock is overvalued.  On the other hand, there are good things that can be said about being a leader in an expanding industry; an already good and increasing ROE and ROA; zero debt and I am sure there are probably some others, if I took a closer look.  
Because of the high PEG, there is a good chance the stock will sell-off systematically in the next market downturn.
You could let the stock run up for now, since that is the current trend, and start selling if a subsequent rally attempt fails to make a new high before running out of steam. Remember: "Ride your Winners and Sell your Losers".
Oh, and keep moving your stop up as the stock moves up.</td>

<td>No offense, but if you cant even spell government or diesel, and believe that the Govt is making big dollars off oil, then you lack the intelligence to invent a vehicle that does not require oil or an oil byproduct. The Govt isnt making money, the oil companies are. Of course, many politicians are involved in oil companies, but the money doesnt GO TO the govt. 

In this world, nearly everything we use is made from oil or oil byproducts. Plastics are made from oil by products. Steel and other metals...oil used in the processing. So, escaping the use of oil or oil byproducts will never happen. However, I have a great idea that the Govt will NEVER buy into:

Legalize marijuana cultivation and use in the country, then tax the hell out of it like they do with cigarettes. The byproduct of marijuana - HEMP - can be used to make virtually ANYTHING on the face of the earth. An entire PC can be made from hemp byproducts - except for the silicon and gold needed for the processors. In the 1930's, H. Ford built an ENTIRE VEHICLE - body, engine and all out of hemp byproducts. He predicted that all cars would be made of hemp within 30 years. The cars actually withstand better crash daamage than a steel car! 

However, because our government is religeously based (on Christianity, unfortunately), we instead waste our money fighting the "EVILS" of marijuana and other drugs, while we deny global warming and continue to use oil. Bush's idea of lowering prices is STUPID - he says were addicted to oil. Do you cure a crack addicts addition by lowering the price of CRACK?!?!?!</td>

You can do that on yahoo finace or you can go to nasdaq.com and type in the ticker.  there you can click on institional holdings and they will actaully tell you the top 5 or so funds that hold that equity.

<td>what's buy side equity analyst and sell side equity analyst?!?</td>
<td>This is an interesting question and one that many people are confused about.

A buy side equity analyst generally works for some type of asset management company (hedge fund, mutual fund, etc) and has the responsibility to make investment decisions.  For example, there is an analyst who work works for Fidelity that might decide that they should buy IBM stock for one of their funds.  The person is called "buy side" because he is on the side of the business that buys stocks in this case.  In the case of the Fidelity analyst, he will do his research and decide on the investment in IBM or some other stock.

A sell side equity analyst's main role is to research companies and provide information to buy side analysts.  A sell side equity analyst may work at Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley, etc.  For example, there is an analyst at Morgan Stanley that probably covers IBM.  It is his/her responsibility to follow the company and publish his or her analysis and recommendations.  This information is then used by the buy-side analyst as part of his/her analysis.

There is more to the story then this but I think this should give you an overall sense as to the difference.</td>

- is this something that people would use
- can my website be referred virally, with people freely recommending it to other people
- who are my competitors and what are their strategies
- how can I get traffic to my website
- do I have enough resources to keep the website afloat
- do I have the technological resources (programmer) to make the website scaleable

As for the best person: that really depends on your overall goals. Some would say you, the entrepreneur, as you will have total control of the business. If you have the technological know how to configure your website to handle the type of traffic you envision, then go for it. Otherwise, do what you do best and get other people to help you (e.g. if you're good in strategic planning and business development, then get a programmer to work with you)

"There is no simple definition of a hedge fund (few of them actually HEDGE). But they all aim to maximise their absolute returns rather than relative ones; that is, they concentrate on making as much MONEY as possible, not (like many mutual funds) simply on outperforming an index."

More Details:

"Hedge funds are loosely regulated investment funds that traditionally take high risks to earn high returns. They come in many flavours and have long been the bane of emerging-market governments, who claim the funds are destabilising. Their case in point is Long-Term Capital Management, which had to be rescued in 1998 after market liquidity unexpectedly collapsed.

Having once struggled to gain investors' trust, now the problem may be too many hedge funds—as more managers chase opportunities in each market, returns have fallen. But this hasn't stopped institutions, mutual funds and the well-off who are not super-rich from investing in them. There is even an online exchange for trading rare and coveted funds. Worries about hedge funds' transparency and market leverage have led to tightening regulation on both sides of the Atlantic."</td>

<td>The obvious way, that most people laugh about, but is truly true, is to NOT spend your money.

Take a look at what your TRUE expenses are.  

#1  Housing Costs (a decent home, NOT a penthouse)
#2  NECESSARY transportation costs (to work, to grocery shop, for NECESSARY things)
#3  Heating costs
#4  Minimal phone costs (unless you have a job that requires cell phones (such as traveling Home Health Nurse), this IS a luxury NOT NEEDED)
#5  Basic Clothing costs (NOT leather jackets, Prada fashions, etc)
#6  Food costs.. buy bulk items, for example, a center cut pork loin can be cut down to 3 to 4 ounce portions and frozen for a month or more of food for a good sized family.  You portion out the meat, wrap it in cling wrap (that new Glad Press'n'Seal is totally worth its cost), then place those wrapped portions in a freezer Zip-lok bag.  This portioning out and double wrapping prevents freezer burn.  You can do the same with beef, chicken, frozen vegetables, etc.  
#7  Buy GOOD quality clothing NOT trendy... buy classical lines and good cloth and cut, a few good items go a long way with just a few accessories... and last MUCH longer too
#8  Wash Clothing in COLD water.. carefully separate colors to avoid fading and staining


There are literally MILLIONS of recipes online, you can find a very good very simple meal that will cost very little.

AVOID:

--Going Out to Eat (this is quite expensive, make it a once a month treat)
--Going to the movies (get bargain rentals)
--Premium Television Channels (there is plenty to watch with basic.. if you are bored, read a book, go for a walk)
--Prepackaged Foods (these are very bad for you and very expensive) ... Home-made is better for you and MUCH less expensive

You need to pick and choose very carefully exactly what you spend.  Do you NEED NEED NEED it... or W-A-N-T it????  You can occasionally get what you WANT.  Just don't make a habit of it.  Say, once a month, get something you have planned for.

This is a BIGGIE... no matter what your age, if you are over 21.. start saving for your retirement NOW NOW NOW!!!

Speak to a Financial Advisor and set up an account and get it deducted from your pay BEFORE you get your pay.  You WON'T even miss it.  TRUST me.  I do this and you do not notice it isn't there.

There is literally almost a million dollar difference between 20 and 30 years of age in what is saved and invested toward retirement.  The earlier the BETTER.  There will likely be little or nothing left of Social Security.. and who wants to wait until 72 to get money that will only be about $350 a month anyway.

If you can afford it, find a company that can do medium risk or diverse portfolios investment.  Putting a little bit (even just $25 a pay) away toward investment is that much more working toward financial independence.

Rich people do NOT spend money.  It sounds like they do, but truly, in the large scheme of things, they don't.

Also, do NOT allow huge deductions for your taxes.  You are giving FREE money to the government based on interest earned.

Sure that tax return is nice, but why not save it yourself (you can have THAT taken out before you get your check too you know) and get the interest yourself.. don't let the government get it.  Think about it, the government gets BILLIONS of free $$ from interest from saps like you and me.

AVOID CREDIT CARDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

let me repeat this...... AVOID CREDIT AND CREDIT CARDS!!!

I suggest you get one (1) SINGULAR credit card like Master Card or Visa.  Use it once a month (SMALL items, say one of those Good Quality Clothes you want to afford), pay off the balance.  Only use this card for EMERGENCY.

AVOID the whole credit crunching scams.  Live by CASH or rather Debit Card directly from your checking account, which is also CASH in the end.  Do not spend what you do not have.

Those ratios are calculated by dividing a (group of) account balance(s), taken from the balance sheet and / or the income statement, by another, for example :

<td>First evaluate if you are in a position to invest in stocks.  A lot of people earn money on stocks, but a lot of people lose money on it too.  Make sure the money you invest is money that you could afford to lose.  DO NOT USE UP ALL YOUR SAVINGS FOR STOCKS.  A key investment tenet/rule is to diversify - do not just invest in stocks; also invest in other forms of investments.  The proportion of all these forms are based on the amount of risk you are willing to take on investments.

If you really have zero idea about investing, and you have a good amount of money to invest, I suggest talking to a number of people to survey your options.  Talk to someone in your bank and get his advice.  Read up on investment advice in Yahoo! Finance.  Hook up with online stock investing companies or offline ones.  Never put your money in something you don't understand - there are a lot of scams these days!  Even seasoned investors get duped.  The major key in investing is information - invest in things you are familiar with and understand.  Learn and read up on your financial options, and follow it up, even if it's a small amount.</td>

<td>what is the safest way to get 8% return on retirement investments please be specific.?</td>
<td>Here is a thought for you. Nothing is guaranteed. Check out the better quality bank stocks. For example BAC. This company has raised its dividend every year for 10 years anyway. Ten years ago it paid 0.60 a share. Today it pays 1.90. The current dividend rate is 4.3% and that is tax advantaged. There is more than half of your 8% return. Do you think that the stock might appreciate the other 3.7%? It's historic appreciation is about 10% annually. 

Of course diversification is the name of the game here. Never put all your eggs in one basket or one industry, or even one country, for that matter. 

If I wanted an 8% return, I would select stocks that pay a dividend of at least 3% or maybe 4% that have prospects of price appreciation and I would make sure that at least 1/3 of them were foreign companies.

Here are some examples

DT   4.7%
ABN  4.7%

<td>No, it's not just $80.24 - $21.56.  

First, we need to find out if there were any stock splits (adjustments in the price of the stock and number of shares outstanding) in IBM's stock during that period and adjust the resulting current price accordingly.

For instance, suppose a person bought 100 shares of IBM stock at $50 per share.  Then within the first year of ownership, there was a 2 for 1 stock split.  At the moment that the split takes effect, that person who owned 100 shares of stock at $50 apiece would now own 200 shares of the stock at $25 apiece.  If after a few years the price of the stock made it up to $45, it would look like that person had lost $5 per share (-10%) during that period.  In fact, he made 80% taking into account only the price appreciation of the stock, assuming no transaction fees.  His original investment of $5000 (100 shares at $50 apiece) would now be worth $9000 (200 shares at $45 apiece).

Furthermore, assuming IBM pays periodic dividends (profit distributions to shareholders) which is more likely than not, the number and amount of these dividends received would need to be added into the person's ROI equation.</td>

<td>How should I buy my stocks?</td>
<td>Some maybe many of the brokers that you talk with are in the business of selling stock. They have things they want to peddle. So it can be a disadvantage to your well being to follow their advice. Many of the on line brokers do have representatives that you can talk with. The two that I deal with do. TD Waterhouse and Fidelity. They will charge you a higher commission to talk to a broker (order taker in this case).  I am sure there are good, knowledgable brokers out there but your chances of finding one are not real good. The good brokers have a customer base that trades millions of dollars at a time. They are not particularly interested in nickle dime trade. 

Perhaps to start you might think about a no load mutul fund. Go to Yahoo Finance and use their tools to find funds that have a high Morningstar rating, at least a 4 star and expenses of not more than 1.5% That strategy will minimize your risks, but not eliminate them. Back in 2000-2, most funds lost money, some a lot of money. But they did not loose as much as those folks that invested in Enron or Delta or United. 

The trick to minimizing risk is to diversify, not only among companies buy also across political boundaries. However, the more diversified one is the closer to the market norm will be ones returns. For that reason index funds have become the current rage. The theory being that it is too difficult to beat the market. 70% of mutual funds do not beat the market. 

Though I do have mutual funds, I prefer to take my chances on being able to pick the best companies to invest in myself. Sometimes I make good picks. Other times they are disasters. But I have only myself to blame. I like it like that.

I personally am young and know a little bit about investing, so I use my 401k to trade individual stocks, buy mutal funds and ETFs. I have a lot of my investment in China stocks or ETFs, also an SP500 spider and a small cap growth mutal fund. I don't believe in diversified assest allocation as most would decribe it. Know doubt it is a "safe" way to invest, but it won't make you the most money. You can make more and have almost the same amount of "safety" by investing well in undervalued stocks or growth areas. Of course, you need to know what you're doing or have someone like Warren Buffet to help you out.

<td>There is no greater posession than a house paid off. If you own the house free and clear you will be able to live on less. You won't have to make so much money. Too many people have giant mortgages thinking that the tax write-off (the interest) is greater than no write-off. Not true, a giant mortgage forces people to make great wages with high income taxes.
A house paid off is still a burden with insurance, taxes, utilities, upkeep and expansion. A house paid off may determine if you can live on $11 or $27 per hour; social security alone or if you must supplement.</td>

<td>Ok I got $200,000, what now.?</td>
<td>Well the first step to managing your finances is to consider your priorities.  With three children you may be concerned about their education and creating a sense of everyday stability.  If your goal is to maximize the livelihood for your family than renting and investing in a business may not be the best options.

Renting can be throwing away money, whereas home ownership is taking your liquid assets and converting them to a home.  Home ownership is preferable to renting; homes tend to appreciate in value.  Buying a home will provide a safe and stable place to live in for you and your familly while allowing for the potential to earn returns on the appreciation or home value.  I'm not certain where you live, but it may be possible to purchase a home with that money or in the least make a significant down payment.  

I would not recommend starting a business if you lack business experience, the rate of small business failure is high.  If you are determined to start a business and do not have a business degree or a masters in business you may want to invest in your education before going forward.  At the end of your education you just may decide not to start a business after all.

In reality $200,000 is not a lot of money--don't get me wrong it is a significant sum of money.  It is very easy to squander that kind of money if you neglect your priorities.  So beware unless you budget and make a plan to use that money wisely.</td>

Commodities are mainly natural resources, especially metals such as gold, silver, aluminum, etc. Oil is the most watched commodity, but there are also less watched commodities such as canola oil or coffee beans that are traded. 

If you want to play them, as an individual investor, you can't just buy a barrel of oil or a bar of silver.

However, you can buy Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in funds tied to the resource, or buy large companies that specialize in that commodity (ie. Alcoa for Aluminum, Barricks for Gold, Petro Canada for Oil).</td>

You can take a loan against it, but you'll  have to pay that back.  I think you can also divide the entire value by how many years you likely have left to live (from actuarial tables) and take annual "substantially equal payments" without penalty.

<td>This is generally true, but not always. If a closed-end fund invests in securities not easily purchased by individuals you will usually find a premium.

Back to the question of the discount...
There are multiple reasons why discounts exist. One can be the "value" of the manager. If the manager is perceived as one who subtracts (rather than adds) value then a discount is natural. Another reason may have to do with liquidity: turning the portfolio into real cash - to which no discount should be applied - may incur many more costs and delays (another type of cost) than investors might think. A further reason might be lack of transparency: if the investing public is less than sure what the fund owns at a particular moment then a discount is only prudent.</td>

<td>Would you ever exercise an American option on a stock prior to maturity?</td>
<td>Yes and it does have to do with dividends.  You'll want to exercise early if the stock is about to pay a dividend and the "time value" of the option is less than the dividend.  

What does that mean?  Well, a stock's price should drop after a dividend is paid so if the current market price is just slightly above your option's strike price, the option could go from an "in the money" option (meaning if you exercise you'll get some cash) to an "out of the money" option (meaning you'll get nothing).  Still, even this wouldn't mean that you'd definitely want to exercise the option unless the expiry date of the option was also coming up.  I.e. the stock price doesn't have a reasonable chance of recovering from the dividend payment to get back "into the money".</td>

Are you trading stocks, commodities, futures, options, or all of these? If the latter, TerraNova is the only one that you can trade everything, real time, online, direct access. A lot of online brokerages claim to give you direct access, but if they take more than a second to execute your trade, it aint direct.

Find the articles online that have evaluated and compared online brokerages. I found a good one online in Barron's, but you'll find others in the trading magazines. 

This is worth putting a little time and effort into, because it's a pain to switch, so once you choose, you're kinda stuck with it. 

Townsend Electronics, the Parent company of TerraNova, is the one that digitized and electronified the Nasdaq. They are technological industry leaders and have a powerful and well built trading system. 

I use RealTick at TerraNovaOnline, but it costs $275/mo, even though it is unlimited what you can do with it. I think the Investor package is free to use, and just uses one screen. 

What you should try is a free trial of their Investor platform, which is free. You only get one window to trade from, but hey, with $5,000-how many stocks are you going to watch? Their rates are good also, but of course, it depends on how often you trade. It will take you months to learn all the bells and whistles of what this program can do.

The other top-of-the line program is TradeStation, but it costs big bucks to join and operate. Some people consider it the Cadillac of trading and technical analysis. 

TerraNova is the home of the Day Trader, so they think nothing of you making several hundred trades a day. You don't have to do that, but it's okay here if you do.</td>

But most people spend more time deciding the color of their new car, than they do on a mutual fund advisor, for example. 

Are you really wanting to do this yourself, or are you asking about someone who is an expert who can do it for you?

If you invest in the stock market right now, or just buy into all the ETF's you can afford, it's a crap shoot, like rolling the dice, and the odds are probably not in your favor, whether you have an expert fund manager or not, because mutual funds are always "in" the market.

They say "Buy and Hold" for the long term is better, but that depends on when you get in, and what your definiton of "long term" is. 

The Dow is now approaching all-time highs last seen in Jan 2000, so if your long-term definition is more than seven years, then you won't mind waiting another seven years for a profit.

In my opinion, the name of the game is capital preservation. When the risks are high, like right now, you get out of the stock and bond markets and park your cash in a interest bearing money market fund or CD or Treasury Bill.

This is simply not a good entry point for investors. Be patient, wait a few months, and you'll be able to buy much more stock a lot cheaper, the risks will be lower (even though they will seem higher), and your chance of success greater.

If you wish to research the “Buy and Hold Strategy” further, or perhaps trade yourself, I recommend two book titles. One is called "Which Is Better, Buy-and-Hold or Market Timing?" The other is "Do You Have What It Takes to Be a Market Timer?" They will give you plenty to think about.</td>

<td>How do you know if a company is undervalued?</td>
<td>If you get someone to figure it out for you, then typically, the company is not undervalued anymore.

You should do your own financial calculations and try to figure out the value of a company if you're inclined.  The problem is that even if you identify an "undervalued" company, there's no guarantee that the company won't lose value in the mean time or that the company doesn't stay undervalued for reasons that aren't in the financial statements.  Also, you need a catalyst for Wall Street to realize that it's undervalued so that they can price it properly.

There's no "best time" to sell either, but it's typically when it has hit your take profit level or when it's valued fairly so there's nothing to be gained by holding onto the company anymore.</td>

Who have invested -- or who are actively in the process of investing -- in a new commercial enterprise:

at least $1,000,000, or
at least $500,000 where the investment is being made in a "targeted employment area," which is an area that has experienced unemployment of at least 150 per cent of the national average rate or a rural area as designated by OMB

If the amount is too stiff for you, maybe an option would be employment-based immigration. The business that you will set up with your US citizen partner can petition you and apply for employment-based green card for you.

It is better though to consult an immigration lawyer.</td>

Then you set what you want to invest in...what companies that is. The best way to go for sure profit is large corporations...don't worry about which ones...that's what the mutual fund is for...the accountant deals in what. He makes a small commission so you doing well is in his best interest. At the great depression...the average was still 3% gains. Today it's realistically 10%. Small corporations have a much higher percentage of increase in value because they start so low. Putting a quarter to a third of your mutual fund towards smaller companies wouldnt be a bad idea.

<td>what is the different between transfer on death and joint tenants with rithts of survivorship?</td>
<td>Transfer on death means that one person owns something and passes it on to another person upon their death.  For example, if a parent specifies that ownership of thier home will transfer on death to their children, then the children have no ownership rights until the death of the parent.  Joint tenants with right of survivorship means that both (or all if more than 2) own it as long as they are both living, but upon the death of either, full ownership would immediately transfer to the other(s).  This is often the way a husband and wife own property together so that, upon the death of one, the other becomes the sole owner of the property.  It is important to give careful consideration to these kind of things to be sure your wishes are met and that you do not create an unnecessary tax burden for your heirs upon your death.  For example, suppose a man with 2 children marries a woman who also has 2 children and the man and woman are in an accident and both are killed, but the man is pronounced dead 10 minutes before the woman.  Because the man died first, the woman now becomes the sole owner of the home and, in the absence of a will or other instrument to designate a different outcome, the 2 children of the woman would now own the home and the 2 children of the man would have nothing.  Think carefully about what could happen and be sure your wishes are clearly defined and implemented.  You may want to consult an Attorney to be sure this is done correctly.</td>

Tom Wirth: MAKER

The difference is they really are a manufacturing company. The reason why I state that is that they are developing the oil sands in Canada.

David Asman: That's sucking oil out of sand.

Tom Wirth: Absolutely. You have to manufacture that oil from the sands to get it to the crude so then it can go to the refiner.

David Asman: The wave of the future and they're on top of it and you think they can go to $40 (Friday’s close: $35.23).

Tom Wirth: I do. I think they will be able to double their output in the next 5-7 years.

Jim Michaels: BREAKER

I got a ditto this one with BP. The price of oil will not stay this high and I think the stock is way up. I wouldn't buy it at this price.

Elizabeth MacDonald: MAKER

I'm a maker. This is a company that's at the forefront of extracting oil from sand. A huge technology. And also they have terrific cash from operations numbers coming in. I like the stock a lot."

"The top stocks to buy
Still, whether Canada's oil is going east or south, it's going somewhere, and that means smart investors should be considering adding some exposure to Canadian oil to their portfolio. One to consider, says Jim Jubak on MSN¹s Money Central, is Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ: NYSE). Natural gas is a crucial ingredient in the process of extracting oil from sand and the firm is Canada's number two natural-gas producer. And it has more than just gas. The firm also has oil-sand deposits and extraction technology that will pay off as long as oil prices remain above $35."</td>

Generally a one shot news item that is of no direct consequence to the market itself is quickly forgotten.

Today however, 4/19/06, the morning news told of March CPI (inflation) being up .4%.  Multiply that by 12 months and it is an annualized inflation rate of 4.8%...much higher than Jan and Feb, which together averaged an annualized 3.8% The stock market HATES inflation because it a precursor to higher interest rates and that hurts the market by making bonds more attractive and also because higher interest rates hurt business profitability and slow down the economy.

If you are willing to sit down and figure out how much you can afford to invest each month - and be realistic - you will have a much greater chance at success.  Also, do you have a lot of high interest debt?  If so, address that before you dedicate too much money to investments.  

Second, set your goals.  Why do you want to invest?  For retirement, college, a new home?  No one can make really good suggestion w/o knowing your goals.  

Stocks, binds, mutual funds, and real estate can all be great investments, but take a few minutes to assess your situation, your goals, and your tolerance for risk before dumping money on a "hot" stock.  There is most likely a good mutual fund to fit your objectives, but you'll never know if you haven't defined your objectives.

The most important thing is that you have decided to start.  Good luck - and I hope you never quit.  Hope this helps.</td>

<td>What does short-selling mean?</td>
<td>As you correctly know 'Short selling' means selling something that you do not have/own. this word is a common terminology used in the capital markets. This word is a combination of 2 concepts. In the capital markets especially the stock makets, if u hold a substantial quantity of a stock or if you are having a paticular stock and you still buy more of it, it means going long or it is said that you are holding a long position or you are long in that stock. Similarly, vice versa if you do not have a particular script/stock nd you still sell it, it means you are going short or you have a short position. The entire process of selling a stock not owned/possesed by you at the time of selling is called 'short selling' whereas the selling a stock owned by you at the time of selling is called 'long-selling' or commonly 'selling'. It is more of a kind of speculation however when done intelligently can give you good profits in a short time. However the catch is that when you short sell the quantity sold must be covered within a definite time frame like the same day, or 1 month from the date of selling,etc. short selling is done when the price of a stock has gone up substantially and you expect it to fall down from thereon. this happens because when the price goes up many people like you come out to sell thus creating more supply then the demand causing the price of the stock to go down. now when the stock goes down many people like you who had gone short earlier look to cover their position thus now creating more demand than supply. also in the stock markets there are people who are ready to buy and sell at every price because someone would find value at that price. You can't really argue as to why would someone like to buy or sell at a particular price coz its a relative concept and depends on person to person. some may find a stock value buy even at 1000 whereas according to you it might not be worth more than 900. Ans as buyers and sellers exist at all levels your stock is bought and sold at all levels.</td>

<td>Intrinsic Value?</td>
<td>You can use the Dividend Growth Model to value your investment based on the current dividend, estimated growth in the dividend and your required return.

The current dividend is 1.75 and based on 3 yr history (assuming this growth will continue) your dividend is growing at 9.04%. Your required return is 12%. 

The stock will return 12% if you were to buy it at no greater than $64.37.

Value = (Current Dividend x (1+ dividend growth)) / (Required Return - Dividend Growth)

But this value is only loosely in line with the concept of "intrinsic value". Instead of explaining the concept of "intrinsic value" here, let me point you to the definitive source on intrinsic value - Warren Buffett.

If you price goes up, you can make  more money, but if the stock goes down you can get a margin call which mean you have to provide money immediately or your broker will sell your stock.

Some people have done this with real estate, but it usually requires a market with high liquidity for the broker to be willing to loan you the money.</td>

<td>do you think its ideal to engage in a restaurant / bar &amp; grill  business?</td>
<td>If you're looking to make your first venture into the business world as an owner, I suggest one of two things:

1) Forget the food business, it's the most complicated industry out there. In no other industry are you expected to be a warehouse and a manufacturer, with parts that are perishable, be a retailer, run a delivery business, and sell service also.

2) If you insist on the food business, especially with no experience, find a very, very well structured franchise to buy into. Forget the cost, it's a drop in the bucket when you weigh out the chances of success or failure compared to trying to build a concept from scratch.

The risks of getting involved in the food business are evidenced by the failure rate of restaurants. These failure rates don't even take into account all the country club, college and university food services that lose money every year and have to be subsidized by other departments. There are unsubstantiated rumors about the food industry that place failure rates as high as 90% in the first year. Though that is a gross exageration, the failure rate in the restaurant world is high, just ask your banker, accountant or lawyer. They deal with it every day. There's a reason restaurant loans are among the toughest to get approved for. According to a report in Restaurant Startup &amp; Growth magazine, based on information gathered from the National Restaurant Association, it's estimated that around 57% of restaurants don't live past the five year mark. Of these, the main casualties are independent restaurants. While 7 of 10 independent restaurants will likely fail, 7 of 10 franchise restaurants will survive. As there are many, many people out there that don't realize the value that real structure will bring to their restaurant, and increase their chances of survival, the greater number of independent restaurants opening compared to franchise restaurants pushes the total restaurant failure rate to 57%.

Most other businesses contain elements of only one or two different industries. With a simpler business, it is much easier to focus on marketing and growth than with a restaurant. Inside a restaurant, most your day is filled with operational procedures, and you CAN NOT work ON a business if you are working IN the business 60 hours or more a week.

<td>what are the best penny stocks to watch and buy?</td>
<td>They're all good to watch. Not many worth buying, unless you like being manipulated.

Anyone with a million dollars or so can pump and dump these stocks and send their prices soaring, so that you get in, then plunging, so that you lose everything very fast. 

Or the average guy, you for example, can start a new company building furniture. It's decent stuff and you have it built in the Caymans so your cost is cheap and you make money. Take the company public and issue stock with an IPO. 

When the stock soars on the IPO, sell your shares and start a subsidiary, and put all your money into that new company making T-shirts. Of course, the furniture company's stock fell considerably, because you took all of the cash out. 

When you make money on T-shirts, go public, and when the IPO soars, sell your shares, and buy back the furniture stock at depressed levels. Of course, the T-shirt stock goes down the tubes, because you pulled the cash out, but hey, you're making a killing onthe stock.

This is legal manipulation. You've been warned. Penny stocks are very risky for a reason, or lots of reasons. Buy something with known value, that's been around awhile, and will continue to be around. So what if you can't buy as many shares? You can still double your money, and reduce your risk in half, by investing in the future of a stable company not ran or manipulated by shysters.</td>

<td>'John Blaze' is full of sh*t; you don't need $25K to daytrade. Open a brokerage account. Study John Murphy, "Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets". Don't trust money managers; they will rip you off. Take control of your money. Find a stock that has huge price swings daily or weekly such as Juniper Networks or Redback Networks. These are high 'beta' stocks. Depending on your age, part of your portfolio should be speculative. If you are in your 20s and your portfolio is less than 100K, then definitely you should be using your knowledge and investing in high beta stocks to profit greatly from their daily and weekly price swings. You have the years to do that. 'Short' the stock when it goes down, and go 'Long' when it goes up. As your portfolio grows to a couple Mil or so, then you can pull back and put some of it in stuff that is a little lower beta such as the QQQ. As an example of how well you can do by taking control of your money: if just do your normal 1% per day on that 100K porfolio over a year through profiting from the swings, how much would you have after one year?

<td>What is the most useful tools for making profit from trading stock options?</td>
<td>There are people that do make money trading options, but it is not for the faint hearted. You are paying a premium for the right to buy or sell the stock at a particular price within a certain amount of time. 

Luck is your most useful tool. If you get lucky and hit a stock during a major move, you will make a lot of money. If you hit a stock at the end of its move, you will loose the amount paid for the options. The more volatile the stock the higher the premium for the option. 

Many professionals use the Black-Scholes Pricing Formula for Call Options. Look it up on Yahoo to determine how it works. It is too complicated to go into here.

Personally I think the best way to make money on options is to write covered calls. That way you get the premium. Of course, if the stock makes a big move on you, some one else gets the benefit of that.</td>

<td>if u won 250 million and took the cash-where would u put it-don't most banks only insure up too 100k?</td>
<td>FDIC insures up to 100K. If you were invested, most brokerages are covered by SIPC insurance.

Terms of SIPC insurance claims that customers of a failed brokerage firm get back all securities (such as stocks and bonds) that already are registered in their name or are in the process of being registered. After this first step, the firm's remaining customer assets are then divided on a pro rata basis with funds shared in proportion to the size of claims. 

If sufficient funds are not available in the firm's customer accounts to satisfy claims within these limits, the reserve funds of SIPC are used to supplement the distribution, up to a ceiling of $500,000 per customer, including a maximum of $100,000 for cash claims. Additional funds may be available to satisfy the remainder of customer claims after the cost of liquidating the brokerage firm is taken into account.

SIPC is your first line of defense in the event of a brokerage firm failure. No fewer than 99 percent of eligible investors get their investments back from SIPC. From its creation by Congress in 1970 through December 2001, SIPC advanced $513 million in order to make possible the recovery of $13.9 billion in assets for an estimated 622,000 investors.

When a brokerage is closed due to bankruptcy or other financial difficulties, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation steps in as quickly as possible and, within certain limits, works to return to you cash, stock and other securities you had at the firm. Without SIPC, investors at financially troubled brokerage firms might lose their securities or money forever…or wait for years while their assets are tied up in court.</td>

A screener will go through the list of stocks in that screener and, based on criteria you define, return a set of results.  Your criteria might be (volume &gt; 100000) or (Price &gt; 5) or (price &gt; 52 week high).  For me, this is the best way to locate stocks that I would be interested in.

Company Title Page
Start with the name and logo of the company, the name and title of your presenter, a one-line description or tagline about the company, and the dollar amount of the round you are raising. 

Business Overview
Boil down your elevator pitch to one sentence. Tell us what you sell or do in very concrete language. This sets the context for the rest of your presentation. 

Management Team
Show us your talent and experience, with one line of background (two lines max!) on each member. 

Market
What's the environment in which you operate, how big are the segments, what are the pain points? 

Product
How do you solve a customer's pain? What exactly do you do? This can be illustrated with a clear product or screen shot, or a simple process diagram, but if we don't know what you do, we won't know why we should fund you. (But don't spend too much time on this, since you're pitching the company here, not the product.) 

Business Model
Who pays whom, how much, for what and from where. What does this mean for annualized revenue streams? 

Customers
Who are they, how many are there, how do you distribute to them, and how are they attracted and retained? 

Strategic Relationships
If you have any, make sure we know about them. 

Competition
Who and how threatening are they? What are the differentiation factors? Include both direct and indirect competitors. Remember that everyone has competition, even if it is just "the old way" of doing something. 

Barriers to Entry
How will other potential competitors be kept at bay? 

Financial Overview
Show us your top-line revenues and expenses, and EBITDA two years back and four years out. 

Use of Proceeds
Where will our money take you? 

Capital &amp; Valuation
How much have you raised previously, who are your current investors, what are you looking for in this round, and how do you come to your suggested valuation? 

Review
Provide a brief summary of what you said, in this same order, narrowed to the five or six most important points. 

Contact Info/Next Steps
Lead us into the next step, such as a follow-up meeting for due diligence...and include your contact info!</td>

<td>what are the drawbacks of DCF compared to other methods? All have estimates and assumptions. What makes DCFtop</td>
<td>DCF methods value the underlying cash flows that a group of assets produce, discounted by the risk of those cash flows.  While this method is very helpful for determining the intrinsic value of the assets or business, it has a few shortcomings.  First, this method relies heavily on assumptions for cash flows, risks, and terminal values.  The output you receive can only be as good as the assumptions you use.  Many times, there are important items omitted or bad assumptions that cause the DCF to be wrong.  Second, the market prices things in such a way that the DCF is not always the best method.  For example, before the tech bubble burst, DCFs were showing values of tech stock that were orders of magnitute less than the relative or market valuations.  Third, since a business is a portfolio of projects, the options (to expand, abandon, special strategic options, etc) may not be taken into account with the DCF and to do so is often very difficult.  Since real options are extremely difficult to price, many analysts exclude them from their calculations, understating the true value of the firm.  There are many many more shortcomings with DCF methods.

Despite these shortcomings, the DCF is a very useful tool.  The trick is to understand the limitations of DCF methology and to incorporate it into a larger valuation frame work.  Typically the DCF will understate value while relative valuation overstates the value.  The differential between the two values can be used to approximate the relevance of the DCF.  If the DCF is significantly different than the relative value, you may want to check your assumptions (and maybe solve for input values that force the output to be similar to the relative value and determine if the new inputs are reasonable).  

If you are reading Valuation by Copeland, Kohler, and Murrin (published by McKenzey and Company), you have a really good text.  If not, pick up a copy of the 3rd edition.  It is really a good professional's guide to appropriate application of DCF techniques.  I know that Intel Capital uses that text as the format for its DCFs.</td>

These are issued by companies which choose to float on the stock market. Companies will sell stock as a 'cheap' way of raising cash. Each stock represents ownership or a 'share' in the company. A typical FTSE 100 company will float billions of shares thus if you buy one share in a company with a float of one billion shares, you own one billionth of that company.

<td>Is there and easy and cheap way to get something patented?</td>
<td>I've looked into this a bit, and it's not that bad.

First, You need to establish a date of invention.  You do this by creating an inventor's log.  This is a dated description of your invention.  You would then have two other people (preferred) attest to your log by signing their name below yours.

Any and all developments, advancements you would log, date, sign and witness.

You can buy an inventor's log, or create one with a spiral notebook.  Try to stay as close to the format, which I'll imagine you'll search for after.

Next, when it comes time to patent, the biggest issue is really one of 'relevant art'.  Is the idea out there already?  Are certain features of the idea out there already?  What differentiates your idea from theirs?  Typically they say that if yours is atleast 10% different, than the relevant art you will be able to patent the idea.

You can do a relevant art search online at www.uspto.gov.  I generally search keywords.  They will give you all patents from 1994 on... Search for similarities there.

I'd recommend at this point if you are satisfied that you idea is patentable contacting a licensed patent searcher.  Look online for one in DC.  They will pour over the relevant art to determine that you have a patentable invention.

This is kind of important.  Cause even if you have a patent on a device.  The patent could be ruled null and void if when challenged relevant artwork was not included or missed in the patent applcation decision process.

Next file for the patent.  This does not seem too difficult and only cost upwards of $200 for US rights.  If you want to file in other countries, typically you have 1 year from your USA filing to file to the other intellectual property departments of other countries.

The US patent process typically takes about 18 months.

If you have a truly unique money maker, I'd find an attorney for writing the application.  You might even offer him 10% equity in the invention to do the work for free.  You will have a higher success rate finding someone who has done this a number of times than figuring it out the first time yourself.</td>

<td>how do I get more people to visit my blog www.alphatrends.blogspot.com?</td>
<td>"If you build it, they will come" is not necessarily true on the Web. Putting a website up is one thing, but getting visitors to come to your site is another. The process becomes even more difficult if you have limited resources to market your business.

Here are some shoestring marketing ideas that can help you get the visitors you need at the least cost possible: 

1. Create the best content you can with the best products you can possibly offer. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.

2. Submit your blog to all blog directories and blog listings. This page contains a comprehensive list of resources for marketing a blog http://www.powerhomebiz.com/onlinemarketing/blogs.htm

3. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. If only 10 people go to your site, but these 10 people invite 10 more - that's additional traffic that you get for FREE!

4. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.

If you are going to read only one piece on search engine optimization, I suggest you read Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's "Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day." http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm 

5. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. My website (see my profile) accepts free press release submission (no strings attached!)

6. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. If 50 websites publish your article and it contains a link back to your website, then you easily get 50 links from a single article. The more links you have, the greater your chances for increasing your search engine rankings.</td>

You have to buy the shares through a stock broker and pay a brokerage commission, but you can buy or sell on a moments notice. If you have an account with Scottrade or other on line broker your commission will be minimal. The fund also charges an administration charge.

<td>http://www.morningstar.com/

It allows you to pick category types and set characteristics of what you are looking for. Part of the site is free however part requires a fee. The free options are good enough for the average investor though. It covers stocks and mutual funds.

By the way, if you are just looking for expert picks be very careful following them. Personally I stay away from expert picks because many experts have an agenda of why they choose a stock that does benefit the normal, average investor. For example, why is it that most stock picks by analyists are near their all time high? Well because their trying to drive up the price so they can sell at the top while you hold the bag. Bottom line if you dont understand how to evaluate stocks on your own... dont invest in them. Get a mutual fund which is really a bunch of stocks in one. There are a lot of options also in regards to mutual funds: company type, size of companies, growth and risk potential for example. I learned the hard way in regards to the analyists back during the tech boom of the 80 and 90's. A lot of them got sued for doing what I said above. Dont think they arent still doing it.</td>

<td>What make the price of gold go up and down?</td>
<td>The price of gold is generally determined by demand, not supply since supply is relatively constant but demand is not. Demand for gold is driven by fear, greed and uncertainty. When there is a lack of fear, greed and uncertainty, the price of gold falls.  Perhaps it is not correct to say a lack of greed. There is always greed. It is just that greed can change its focus. When the price of gold increases greed tends to focus on gold. 

The price is also affected by interest rates. When interest rates are low, as they have been for the past 5 years, money tends to come out of savings and go into alternative investments such as gold. When interest rates are high, it becomes more attractive to save money.

Now with the U S waging war and the price of oil heading north, and U S jobs being shipped to China and India, there is a lot of fear and uncertainty out there. Then as the price of gold rises, it tickles the old greed bone, which adds to demand. The fact that interest rates are now rising is a mitigating circumstance.</td>

<td>How do I find the present value of a short position zero coupon bond?</td>
<td>It is slightly tricky unless you have access to Reuters or Bloomberg information systems, but you need to get the "zero coupon" interest rate corresponding to the time period in question.  If  you are in the US, you are in the lucky situation of having long and short term rates about the same level, so you can just use the Treasury yield.  

Once you get this rate (check out Yahoo finance) you use this equation:

discount_factor = 1/(1+r/2)^(2*t)

where r is the rate (in the form .05 for 5% for example) and t is the number of years to maturity of your zero coupon bond.  

Note that in derivative world, professionals will often price off of LIBOR, which is fairly close to treasury rates right now.  I am assuming the issuer of this bond is a very good credit.  If they are a bad credit, like GM, then you would need to add their credit spread to the rate "r" to get the right number.

Finally, to get the answer, if the face amount of the zero coupon is say $1 million then you would multiply this number by the discount_factor (which is always less than one).</td>

<td>how the price of a stock is defined every minute during active trading?</td>
<td>You used the example of Microsoft, which is a very actively traded stock with huge volume. 

What you are suggesting is either arbitrage, or stock manipulation; probably the latter. Surely you aren't mad at Microsoft?

For the size of this company and number of outstanding shares, it would take hundreds of millions of dollars to move the price of the stock significantly. You would never move it to $1, because everyone knows the stock is worth more than that, and that the company is not going out of business. You could sell a billion dollars of that stock and not cut it in half.

If you're near a brokerage office, stop by and look at a quote machine and observe the active bids for Microsoft -- there are millions of shares bid at every price level close to the current price. Those are the people that you will have to take out before you move the stock price significantly. 

The floor traders and dealer/brokers and specialists do not literally "set" the stock price; supply and demand does that, and you better believe there's going to be a huge demand for Microsoft at $15 or $20, after you sold your billion dollars of stock, and after you get through the millions of shares quoted at bid. The net effect will be that you lose at least 10% and probably 20% on your foolish endeavor to try and manipulate the price against market forces, when demand comes surging in and drives the price back up.

That's a cool $200 million loss to you.</td>

About the passing rate, it is based on the number of candidates that managed to pass the CFA exams in a straight row, not including those who have failed and resit. Currently, about 50000 people worldwide have this qualification. It is said that those who obtained this qualification will received salaries higher than their equal

For actual online standard trading platforms I would recommend PacificTrader which is very comprehensive and an excellent package.

Ofcourse if you are looking for a great system to follow then I would recommend Point and Figure charting which is the only form of analysis that gives crystal clear buy and sell signals. Tom Dorsey has written a book on this (ISBN 0471412929) and also has a website that can help.

The minimum amount is 500 Barrels.

Those wishing to trade NYMEX miNY™ energy futures must first establish an account with a New York Mercantile Exchange clearing member firm, either directly or through a brokerage firm that does futures business. 

You only buy 500 Barrels of Oil if you are a Company that actually needs the Oil for something. For example if you are General Motors and you have a factory that makes plastic pieces for your cars you obviously need Oil because Plastics are made of Oil.

If you are not a Company and you don't need 500 Barrels of Oil you sell your contract before the expiration date to someone who actually needs the Oil.

A Future is a Contract to buy 500 Barrels of Oil in the future for $75.00 each.

Oil futures are highly especulative and you should not invest in Oil futures if you don't have at least $1,000,000.00 in assets (excluding your primary residence)

Once you have bought a Future you have the obligation to buy the Oil.

On the other hand, Options give you the right (But not the obligation) to buy the Oil.

Options are highly especulative and you should not invest in options if you don't have at least $500,000 in assets (Excluding your primary residence)

For example, Oil is currently at $75 but if you think Oil is going up you buy an Option with the right to buy the Oil at $75 in the future and if the Oil goes all the way to $100 you make a lot of money.

On the other hand if Oil goes below $75 you lose your entire investment. 

For example, Oil is currently at $75 but if you think Oil is going down you buy an Option with the right to sell the Oil at $75 in the future and if the Oil goes all the way down to $50 you make a lot of money.

On the other hand if Oil goes above $75 you lose your entire investment. 

If you are serious about investing in Oil you can drop me a line.

<td>If (1.0525)to the nth exponent = 6. How do you solve for n?</td>
<td>Everyone else gave you the answer using logs.  That is the best way to do it.

Suppose that you didn't know anything about logs.  Then how could you solve it?  You could just try different values.

The hard way to do this is to start ant one and keep going until you get the right answer.  Let's not do that.

Let's starts with 1 -- we know it is too small, because 1.0525^1 = 1,0525 &lt; 6.

Let's try a big number, like 100 -- that gives 1.0525^100 = 166.8 -- too big

So, let's try 50

that gives 1.0525^100 = 12.9 -- too big

If 50 is too big, and 1 is too small, let's try 25

that gives 1.0525^25 = 3.59 -- too small

25 is too small, 50 is too big, let's try 37

that gives 1.0525^37 = 6.6 -- too big

Here, we could try half way between again (31) -- or we could notice that 6.6 is a lot closer than 3.59 and try a number closer to 37 -- like 35.

that gives 1.0525^35 = 5.995 -- just about right.

If you want N as an integer, you are fine.  If you need more decimal places, you can try values that are between 36 &amp; 37 until you ge the desired accuracy.</td>

<td>Where is a good place to get a start up business grant?</td>
<td>It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.

Nonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.

Even if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.

Even SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... 

"The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."

Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program 

Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs 

For private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for "students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices." Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.

Otherwise, it is an impossible question. What is your time frame? Are you a long-term investor, a Day Trader, what?

But you are in luck, because two time frames have coincided here in the oil stocks. The entire group has had a good run, of course, but many of them have backed off since the January high. They are just now beginning to rally again, so you have the opportunity to buy them at a discount.

<td>It will significantly benefit you.  Stocks trading on the pinks have almost no legal obligations regarding disclosures.  There is material fraud in the pinks as a consequence people avoid them and so they are often mispriced.  If they are successful in their application, the price should eventually increase from greater market size and you will know more about the company.</td>

<td>which is ore profitable in stock investing intraday or f and o?</td>
<td>I'm going to assume the question is "Which is more profitable in stock inversting, intraday trading or fundamentals &amp; analysis?".  If thats not the question, just ignore the answer.

Personally, for all the scepticism and mockery intraday trading (ie day traders) get, I've seen a few that do very, very well; at least for awhile.  Problem is after being successful they get a bit lazy; the stock market changes and their techniques do not work as well; or their stake gets to big and they now are not nimble enough to keep up the great returns; or something else goes wrong and they just lose their edge - but sometimes they get it back later.  Also, to succeed and day trading you have to be willing to pretty much sit in front of a computer much of the day and do nothing but monitor your stocks, plus do all sorts of related activities with discipline.  A boring proposition so many, but some like it, and if you are good at it it does pay well.

For fundamentals and analysis there are also lots of trick and traps, but if your selection critieria is sound you can probably make your picks and then put them on auto-pilot for awhile (though learning how to make those best selections can itself take a long time).  You can also invest larger and larger amounts with much less problems (look at Warren Buffet, then imagine how easy it would be to day trade 100 billion dollars), but I really don't think the returns are quite as good as for the best day traders and its also somehow not as exciting.

Anyhow, whichever one you choose there is a massive learning curve for both of them, so expect to have mediocre or worse results for a long time before everything works out (and read, read, read on your choice to shorten the curve).  

Get really good at either of those and you can do very well (but quite frankly for every one person who emerges as a good trader or investor, there are many others that fail - you need to really work at it to make it).

Best of luck.</td>

<td>What is the difference between registered and unregistered shares?</td>
<td>Here is my take:

Unregistered shares are those that are bought and sold through a stock broker. These shares are held "in street name." This means that the shares are held in the name of the stock brokerage, on behalf of you. All share related info (proxy voting, statements, etc.) is passed through your stock broker. All dividends are paid through the broker, and usually end up as cash in your broker account

Registered shares are bought and sold directly through the company, and in some cases you will receive an actual stock certificate. All stock material is sent through the actual company (or a firm that handles the paper work for them). All dividends are paid mailed out as check directly to you, or are re-invested as more shares in the company.

Having Registered shares will allow you to take advantage of some dividend re-investment plans (DRIPs). Also buying stock directly from the company is usually cheaper than buying from a stock broker (even the on-line ones!).
Selling or liquidating registered shares is usually more difficult than unregistered shares. You would either have to sell them back to the company, or register them into a stock broker account (where the would become unregistered.)</td>

<td>How would you rate the following discount brokers: Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab?</td>
<td>It very much depends on what you want.  If all you plan to do, is trade listed US stocks, the best and cheapest broker is probably Brown &amp; Co.

For more diversified investing, Fidelity and Schwab are a close tie.  Both have an amazing selection of no-fee mutual funds, if you are interested, and both are well-equipped to service high-volume traders.  I personally chose Schwab because of their efficient and fast funds transfer system (linked to your bank account) and the fact that they have many services normally offered by banks.

If you want to go all-out and trade on multiple continents and exchanges, call TD Waterhouse.  They have discount brokerages in at least 5 countries and, if you have a reasonable amount of money to invest, they can help you out.  This way, you can trade stocks not even available in the US.  They are also a full-service bank and will work with you if you want more, than just brokerage services.</td>

<td>How does one seek investors?</td>
<td>As a professional 'angel' investor (exactly the type of person you're looking for) let me take a stab at answering the question, even though the answers are not necessarily what you  want to hear.

To begin with, the previous answer, while well-meaning, contains quite a bit of basically wrong information along with some useful tidbits, so take it with a very big grain of salt.

Now, to your question: the financing world is much, much more complex and challenging than you can possibly imagine. Investors have much better things to do with their time than  come down and listen to you pitch your idea, especially when you have no experience at all in starting or running a business.

The number of businesses seeking funding that actual receive investments is much, much less than 1%(!) The other 99 businesses that you would be competing against for funding are (I can assure you) equally exciting opportunities, but run by people with many years of business experience, detailed operating and financial plans, and a great deal of their own money invested. While your enthusiasm will serve you well throughout your business life, the absolute best advice that anyone can ever give you is:

PUT YOUR BUSINESS IDEA ON THE BACK-BURNER FOR NOW, GO TO COLLEGE, AND DEVELOP THE SKILLS THAT YOU WILL NEEED TO ULTIMATELY CHANNEL YOUR ENERGY INTO A SUCCESSFUL COMPANY!

That said, once you get to college, you will find that many schools these days have entrepreneurial clubs and even business plan competitions, where mentors and advisors will help you with your ideas, and you will learn about all the thousands of things (quite literally) that you will need to do to start a business.

To get some background, by all means pick up a couple of good books on the subject (and there are hundreds.) I've included Amazon links to two of them below. The first is a great book called "The E-Myth Revisited", which is probably the most important book you'll read because it discusses WHY you want to start a business, and how you have to think about it.

The second link is to "Start Your Own Business" by the editors of Entrepreneur magazine. It is an 800 page book that tells you (at least once-over-lightly) absolutely everything you need to know about starting a business...including how to find financing (which is what you were asking in the first place.)

Good luck with your entrepreneurial ambitions, but PLEASE, for your own sake, make the first investment in yourself by going to college for the next four years. It will pay off in spades down the road, I promise you!</td>

<td>I want to start investing money on stocks but i have no idea of how to start... can anyone help me???</td>
<td>Start learning.  You're young and you have time to start building a solid foundation and if you're dilligent you'll be able to accumulate serious wealth by compounding your gains.  So if you're going to invest, stick with it, add to it, and don't spend your gains until you reach key levels, like pulling funds for a down payment for a house or something of that nature.   Compounding is the one true way to real wealth.   Here's a very simple example: $1000 earning 20% compounded interest will grow to over $1 million dollars in 38 cycles.  Whether those cycles are years or trades are up to you.  Of course this example doesn't take into account losses on trades, but you get the point.  Besides, if you're doing it right losses will be minimal in the overall scheme of things.

So start by learning HOW to invest by determining WHAT to buy through Fundamental Analysis and determining WHEN to buy through Technical Analysis. 

Start with Investors.com, it's William O'Neil's online version of Investors Business Daily.  The How To Invest section is the best place to start learning the importance of Fundamentals and the basics of Technical Analysis.   The site has the IBD 100, a cross index list of the market leaders, the Stock Checkup, a great tool for checking fundamentals on any stock, and articles and analysis of stocks and general market conditions.  They also run various screens every day which in addition to the other lists, (IBD100, New America, stocks under $10, CANSLIM select, ect) are very helpful for finding investment ideas with solid Fundementals that are ready to move.  The CANSLIM method alone is a very successful and popular trading system, but I prefer to use a combination of Fund &amp; Tech Analysis, rather that just the rating system alone. 

From there you can move on to more detailed study of Technical Analysis. 

Start with StockCharts.com, they have an excellent free Chart School which helpfully explains various chart patterns and Technical Indicators and overlays.  Pay particular attention to the Chart Patterns section, and make sure you learn about Zig Zag patterns, Bollinger Bands, Moving Average, Volume, RSI, the MACD (Mac-D), The Williams %er, Stochastics, and the Chaikin Money Flow.  Sounds complicated, but when you start chart reading you'll want about a half a dozen or so of these overlays and indicators.  I personally rely heavily on the ZIG-ZAG, MACD, Chaikin Money Flow, Volume, Moving Average and RSI. 

StockTA.com is also an excellent Technical Analysis site, with charted Fibonacci resistance and support lines and will tell you if the stock is bullish or bearish in the short, medium and long run.  The site also has an extensive Candle Pattern Glossary and a fantastic technical screener. 

The above sites do have premium services, but all the services I mentioned are free.  After you've absorbed some of the Technical information, do some reading on Fibonacci numbers and Elliot Wave theory, there are good links in the "School" section of StockTA.com.  I've been using Elliot Wave and Fibonacci's to help refine my in and out points.  StockCharts.com's "ZigZag" overlay helps me plot and count the waves and that helps determine where I am in the overall pattern. 

So basically I'll find interesting stocks through the screens on Investors.com or StockTA.com, run them through the Stock Checkup at Investors.com, if they measure up I'll run them through the Analyisis &amp; Fib Analysis at StockTA.com and do an extensive chart study, examining the 2 yr, 1 yr, 6 mth, 3 mth, 1 mth &amp; 5 day on StockCharts.com.  At the same time I'll also be doing my due dilligence; studying the profile, key statistics, headlines, etc. through Yahoo Finance and web searches.  If it all measures up and the stock is in a base or in a pull back and it's starting a wave 1 or wave 3, it's time to buy.

You should be concentrating on adding to that nest egg and getting it to a sizable amount before talking stocks or mutual funds. When I say "sizable, I'm talking $5k - $10k at the very least.

If you invest that money and you aren't charged any fees at all (not likely) and you make a super-duper 20% return on $500 the first year, you've made a measly $100. How long would it take you to find $100 to add to that nest egg just by working at Taco Bell? A couple of days?

Put that money wherever you want and concentrate on building it up before you start talking investing. Otherwise the hard work over such small amounts of money in return will burn you out.

If you really want to invest that money wisely, buy some books on investing or on your education in some field that really gets your blood flowing that will enable you to make serious money by making yourself more valuable either to an employer or out in the business world.

Then you'll really see a super duper exponential return on your money if you do it right. The first book you might consider buying with that money is a book by Warren Farrell entitled "Why Men Earn More". It was written primarily for women but it will be no less helpful to you as a guy. It'll teach you where the money's at.

Number two on the list you should consider would be, "The Richest Man in Babylon" by George S. Clason. Then if you'd really like to get serious about making some really serious money, number three should be, "Mentored by a Millionaire" by Steven K. Scott. Number four could be, "The Millionaire's Secrets" by Mark Fisher.

An underwriter, usually an investment banker, packages the deal and seeks investors to buy the new issue. The charge a lot for this and usually keep some of the equity for themselves. You will have to give up your 100% position. Companies will sell up to 45% of themselves in their IPO but usually less than that.

The company will have a valuation, that is a very thorough examination of its worth by financial analysts. Once a value is reached the underwriter will seek buyers for that value on the street.

The SEC and state securities enforcement will have to be satisfied the numbers make sense and the officers and directors of the company are legitimate and pose no threat to the investing public. This is not easy.

You can do this in a small scale with a SB 1 filing with the SEC and there are exemptions under Regulation D for small sales of equities and debt. 

Your pay off comes from the value of the stock you still holding going up and the company benefits because the underwriter usually guarantees a certain dollar amount, the valuation, for the stock it sells.

<td>any new business ideas related to new energies?</td>
<td>Heres all kinds of mind-blowing long-suppressed facts about Humanity's best 
friend "The Cannabis Plant". Hemp or Cannabis as it is scientifically referred to is the fastest growing 
biomass source on Earth. Biomass is a cheap and efficient source of fuel. As a matter of fact, if we 
were to farm only 6% of the country's available farmland with hemp we could meet all of the 
country's Industrial energy and transportation needs. Hemp is 26 times stronger than cotton and lasts 
10 times longer. We can produce 4 times as much paper from Hemp as we can from trees at one 
fourth the cost and 1/5 the pollution and it is 10 times stronger and lasts ten times longer. It is a fact 
that Betsy Ross made our first flag "Old Glory" from Hemp fiber. Also, our Constitution and 
Declaration of Independance were printed on Hemp paper. The soldiers clothes during the 
revolutionary war were made from Hemp. The second most prescribed medicine in the United 
States for 150 years for over 100 different medical illnesses was a Cannabis extract and it is alot 
stronger when taken in concentrated form.
Flexible and environmentally friendly 
Hemp is one of the most versatile plants known to mankind. Its fibres can be used for textiles and ropes or made into paper. Its seeds are a valuable food rich in unsaturated oils, which can also be used as fuel. Hemp requires few pesticides as it quickly outgrows any weeds. It leaves the soil clean for other crops. When hemp stalks are dew-retted in the fields most nutrients are returned to the soil for the next crop. 

Hemp for textiles 
When in the middle of the 19th century in California Levi Strauss invented the original jeans he made them from hemp canvas because it was the most durable textile available. Hemp could replace many uses of cotton, which uses 50% of all agrochemicals used in the USA. Unlike cotton hemp grows in many climate zones, from the tropics to subarctic conditions. It will grow anywhere in Japan, from Okinawa to Hokkaido. From the Jomon era until the late 18th century, when imported British and American cotton took over, hemp linen clothed the Japanese masses. 

Hemp oil for food and fuel 
Hemp oil is so versatile that it can be used instead of diesel fuel or you can fry tempura in it. Before petroleum and electric lightbulbs, lamps burning hemp seed oil illuminated homes around the world. One ha of seed hemp produces about 1000-1500 litres of hemp oil plus several thousand kg of cellulose-rich fibre. One ha of fibre hemp produces about 8000-11000 kg of dry biomass. 

As a renewable resource from living plants hemp does not contribute to the greenhouse effect. The growing plants absorb as much CO2 as will later be released when oil or other plant matter is burnt. Unlike fossil fuels (oil, coal, gas) or nuclear fuels hemp could supply us with raw materials for thousands of years, without ever changing our climate and without producing waste that remains radioactive for millions of years. 

Hemp for paper 
Hemp is an excellent archival material, for use in paintings and books. Most famous paintings are painted with hemp oil on hemp linen. In ancient China the art of making paper from hemp (and mulberry bark) was guarded as a state secret, but eventually the knowledge found it's way to Japan, and also to Europe via the Arabs. In 1390 the first European mill processing hemp rags into paper was founded. In 1455 Gutenberg printed the first printed book in Europe on hemp paper. The first two drafts of the U.S. Declaration of Independence were written on Dutch hemp paper. 

Traditional Japanese paper (washi) was made from hemp and mulberry fibre. Nowadays hemp is virtually unavailable for this purpose though a limited supply of hemp paper has been manufactured in Tochigi recently. Hemp and mulberry paper are also used for ritual strips of paper decorations used at Shinto shrines. Japan imported the recipe for paper making from China w</td>

<td>Why have the big oil companies ignored bio diesel technology?</td>
<td>Big Oil is rapidly coming up to speed, Jeremy.  From Treehugger.com, on April 6th:

"The burgeoning biodiesel industry got a friendly boost from a somewhat unlikely source: big oil. Motiva Enterprises, a large oil company headquartered in Houston, recently announced that the Motiva Enterprises terminal in Dallas will now offer biodiesel at any blend level. Petroleum distributors who deliver biodiesel to retail outlets and other customers in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area can now load pre-blended biodiesel on their tanker trucks. This allows distributors to get more biodiesel distributed, as the deal eliminates the additional cost and inconvenience of making two stops to obtain the biodiesel and petroleum diesel, and purchasing blending equipment. Motiva, a partnership between Shell Oil Co. and Saudi Refining Inc., is among the first major oil companies to provide a blending and loading terminal for the alternative fuel; other refiners who already blend biodiesel at the terminal level include Valero Energy Corp. and Tesoro Corp. Biodiesel kingpin Willie Nelson was joined by fellow booster Morgan Freeman to announce the installation of a 30,000-gallon heated tank that will allow biodiesel to be loaded onto tanker trucks already fully blended with petroleum diesel."</td>

<td>Real Estate Investing: any tips and pointers on how to avoid the scams and cons in real estate investing?</td>
<td>The biggest con in real estate investing is the concept of get rich quick. No investment is going to cash out in your favor immediately. Discounts are difficult to find and take some research. Due diligence should be given to every deal and if the seller or person bird dogging the deal pressures you drop it.

For the basic investor there are these options: Flips, purchases for income, purchases for holding.

Flips are basically buying a distressed or undervalued property, fixing it up, and reselling it for more than you paid for it. The less real money of your own you have to invest the better and the faster you turn it around the better.

Buying for income is purchasing a property for its residual income value, that is the rent you will receive from tenants. In the mean time you hope that it appreciates in value so that you build equity.

Buying to hold usually means your own home(s).

There is nothing mystical or magical about buying tax sale properties, or estate and REO properties. You don't need to spend a thousand dollars on some tapes or a seminar to do any of these. Properties up for taxes can be purchased, or the taxes themselves at your local country administration building and the process is free. You have nothing to lose because even if the owner redeems you get paid a big fat premium for your trouble. Beats a CD at the bank and best case scenario you win a property for pennies on the dollar with a clear title.

Scam II: We will find an investor to make your deal work because you have no money. What profit motive is there in that? All the books, tapes, seminars and nonsense about the cash flow connection is just that, nonsense. Make the investment yourself or with your own pool of investors and keep expense and dilution to a minimum.

Good luck and I'll be looking forward to your profiles in the Wall Street Journal next year.</td>

<td>You can get a feel for the "game" and not own a share of any stock. Select some stocks you think might be a good buy and set up a portfolio on a spreadsheet. Follow the stocks over a period of time and see how you did. Have a reason why you picked each stock and see if it turns out to be correct.

Also pick a couple of good index mutual funds from Vanguard, Fidelity, T Rowe Price and see how they do. I'd bet in a year they will be doing better than the total of the stocks you pick yourself.</td>

<td>I will get a partial lum sum of $100,000.00 when I retire what should I invest this in.?</td>
<td>This is a very vague question!  You should sit down with a Financial Consultant and create a financial plan.  That person should ask you your risk tolerance. 
What type of income will you be getting from pension, social security, or other areas?
Are you selling a business? 
Will you be working after you retire from this company?
What types of debt do you have now vs when you retire? 
If there is any additional income that you'll have.  
What is your tax situation?
Who are your beneficiaries?
Have you already planned for long term care (one out of two people will need it in the future) 
How long do you want to lock up your money?
Do you have enough life insurance so your wife will be reasonably comfortable?
Have you created a trust or will?
Do you have grandkids?

There's 100 different ways to go about it.  I would recommend seeing a *Certified* Financial Planner with your wife. It will be a nightmare eye-opener for you. 
It will be the equivalent of you sitting naked in someones office. LOL 
  Be careful going to one of the large or smaller brokerage houses first because you'll be like live bait.

Off the top of my head should you wait to retire when your older?  Will you outlast your retirement funds?</td>

<td>Its never smart to get involved with just one stock. You should spread your stock out among different industries. Which ones to invest in depends on the person. One person may say technology, some may say computers, some may say medical technology and some may say precious metals. I have a little in each of these and others that I have researched for myself. This is a good site if you want to do research. Good luck.</td>

<td>Please explain "stoploss"?</td>
<td>Is a term used in the stock market when a share holder decides to sell at a predetermined price. This will enable him to either lock in the profit he has made or accept the loss at an predetermined level.
Mostly used by people who may not be monitoring the price movement continuously and will have the stop loss order placed with the broker. If the price does drop to the level predetermined by the owner then the stop loss order is triggered and the stock is sold provided there are buyers.
If the price does not drop or gains then stop loss order is not triggered.</td>

<td>what is commercial paper?</td>
<td>Commercial paper is short term unsecured debt by a business, usually under six months.  It includes unsecured notes and banker's acceptances.  Bankers acceptances are post dated checks that the bank has already accepted and will guarantee payment on at maturity.  It is rated by independent agencies, generally, and is usually quite safe.  If you buy a money market fund, you are buying commercial paper indirectly along with t-bills.  If you had an E-Trade account, you could purchase it along with other short term debt if it was available to the public.  Most commercial paper is not readily available to small investors.  The original commercial paper was McMoney.  McDonalds was able to successfully float short term IOUs to the public and ended its borrowing from banks.  Other firms followed.

Note:  You are better off, from a safety and return perspective, to open a high rate money market account.  I believe GMAC Bank offers 4.75%, which is higher than the commercial paper rate, especially when commissions are considered.  I suggest you visit www.bankrate.com.</td>

<td>what happens if i quit the co that has keough plan? do i get to keep what is earned?</td>
<td>That's a GREAT question and an important one. If you quit a firm that has a 401K (I presume you mean that by the Keough) you can TAKE IT WITH YOU in a single traditional IRA account. YOU GET TO KEEP WHAT YOU EARNED in a traditional IRA. This is advisable, as you can put the investments into funds or stocks that you choose. Your 401K has choices made by your HR dept, not always for how good an investment it might be, but based on choosing a 401K plan that can be administered cheaply by the benefits department. While you can leave it at the 401K plan, you are far better off to transfer it to your own IRA account.

So, to better your results, transfer your 401K when you leave by contacting the HR dept and asking for a distribution form. DO NOT take the check yourself, have the 401K transfered directly into your IRA account you've set up at a brokerage. Your broker will direct you into better investments, or you can research this yourself and do it yourself with fund companies or online brokerages if you feel you are willing to spend the time on the research.</td>
