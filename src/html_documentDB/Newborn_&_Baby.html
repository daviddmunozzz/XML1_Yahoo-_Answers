<td>Can you mix breast milk and baby formula together?</td>
<td>It's okay to mix breast milk and baby formula together.  But it's better if you keep them separate.  The reason is if the baby doesn't finish the whole bottle, you'll lose the breast milk.  You can give priority to the breast milk and only use formula when needed.  Remember, breastmilk is always better than baby formula.</td>

<td>How old is too old for a baby to be swaddled at night?</td>
<td>When your baby decides they are "too old" for it.  ;)

A baby will be more calm and sleep better while swaddled IF swaddling is "for" them.  

If they do not like to be swaddled, they will be more fussy while swaddled than not.

My daughter (18 yrs old now) NEVER liked to be swaddled.  From the very beginning, she would just about turn purple screaming if I tried to swaddle her!  So, after a time or two, I stopped and she was fine (just made sure she was in a sleeper (bag or footed) if it was cool in the room).

My grandson (who is currently 7 1/2 months old) seemed to be soothed by swaddling at first.  I was amazed since his mother hated it so much! haha..  He seemed to prefer being swaddled until he was about 3-4 months old.  If we try to swaddle him now, he will just wiggle right out of it!</td>

<td>how much milk should my 3 month old baby drink in a 24 hour period?</td>
<td>Your baby should not be drinking any milk at 3 months old. He should only be drinking formula, By 3 months my babies were drinking about 5 oz every 3 1/2 hours.  If you burp him half way through his bottle you may be able to get him to drink more than he is and keep him in an upright postion when feeding him he will get less air this way. Air in the tummy causes aches and a feeling of fullness. Hope this helps you some and if not I hope someone elses answer does. It is a horrible feeling to worry with your childs health. I hope his surgery goes well. Best of luck to you.</td>

<td>What can I do to keep my month old awake more during the day so he will sleep through the night?</td>
<td>Good question, at a month old, there really is nothing you can do to keep them awake. They eat, sleep, and poop. You should have better luck at around 3 months when they are more aware of their surroundings and will be interested in things. Best bet for now is to feed a tad bit more at night and give a bath, that may help but not a whole lot. Good luck.</td>

<td>Are the names Jennifer and John still popular baby names?</td>
<td>In the United States for 2004, John was the 18th most popular boys name, and Jennifer was the 38th most popular girls name.

The page below lists the top 10 names, but it also some searches you can do to find additional information, like look for the top 100 names of the year, and show exactly how many children were given that name.

When you do that, you can see that while John was number 18, Jonathan was number 21.  So, if you considered them the same name, it looks like John/Jonathan would actually be the second most popular name after Jacob/Jake.  I might have missed some other combinations, but Jacob/Jake was the only one I noticed that would have been more popular.

For Jennifer, the same thing could apply if you look at Jenifer as well, except that spelling is rather uncommon and I don't think it would make much of a difference in its ranking.</td>

<td>What is the best way to move a baby off the breast to a bottle?</td>
<td>If you haven't introduced the bottle yet, you may have missed your window of opportunity. I was never able to get my daughter to take a bottle, but I did manage to transition her from breastfeeding directly to a sippy cup. Try the Tupperware sippy cup or a sippy without the leakproof stopper so he can get at the liquid more easily. If you're worried about spills, start him out with a cup of water in the bathtub.

If you haven't introduced solids yet, you can safely give him baby cereal, pureed fruits and vegetables, and small shreds of meat.  If he has some teeth already, you can give him chunkier mashed fruit and 
well cooked vegetable pieces.</td>

<td>Both of my daughters end up having pneumonia alot?</td>
<td>children in general are more likely to get pneumonia. There are a number of reasons for this. The first is that they are usually exposed to more illnesses, through daycare, playgroups, etc. The other is that their bodies and immune systems are not quite like an adult's. When a child is ill, they tend to make a lot more mucous than an adult (have you ever seen the amount of snot that comes out of a 1 year old's nose?) More of this drains down into their chest and they have a less effective cough mechanism to clear it out of their lungs. This is one of the reasons why young children are more likely to wheeze (and grow out of it), and also one of the reasons why they are more likely to end up with pneumonia because of a cold. They just can't cough the mucous out of their chest and it becames infected - a pneumonia. In general, having 2 episodes of pneumonia during the childhood years is not unusual, although it would be something to watch. Having 3 episodes would generally be a reason to do an evaluation - lab work, and maybe seeing a specialist ( in particular a pediatric lung specialist). The fact that both parents have asthma, (oftentimes frequent "bronchitis" is asthma that hasn't been diagnosed) is a big risk factor for your  children having asthma. Poorly controlled asthma is in turn a risk factor for having pneumonia. It's not clear that  anything needs to be done yet about either of your daughters but it does merit close watching. I would definitely ask your pediatrician what their take on this is.</td>

<td>How is MYELIN production in infants associated with memory?</td>
<td>It's one of the reasons that breast-feeding is recommended. DHA and other fats in the breast milk contribute directly to brain growth by providing the right substances for manufacturing myelin, the fatty sheath that surrounds nerve fibers, insulating them so that these pathways can carry information.</td>

<td>How can I get my 6 month old child to sleep longer than 1/2 an hour or 40 minutes at a time?</td>
<td>put baby to sleep in the same spot EVERY time. soon baby will be comfortable with suroundings and know this is my sleep spot. make sure baby is put to sleep and wakes up in the same spot, for example if baby is rocked to sleep, then put in crib- they might wake up and be mad that they are not being rocked anymore. Also try sticking to a schedule. it may be difficult at first, but is worth sticking to. my 6 month old was the exact same way, so we started setting him down for naps at the same time every day, in his crib. Now we can pretty much set our watches to what time he naps, for how long, and what time he goes to bed and wakes up. it wont happen overnight, but baby has to have a schedule, oh yeah- make sure baby isn't going to bed hungry</td>

<td>What govmt programs are out there to help single moms with child care?</td>

I have looked into it myself.  Some people are required to pay a co-pay, but compared to the $100 - 200 a week, the co-pay is not much of anything.  A application and intake will need to be completed.  I know how frustrating it is when money is short.

Editted to add that I work for the Employment Center in Ohio.  Here we have a program that if the parent is going to school or seeking employment through us we help with support services such as child care.  Maybe that would be a benefit to her also.  People qualify for our services if they are underemployed, dislocated from a job, or a displaced home maker.</td>

You can't just stop abruptly as you can cause caked breast which is an uncomfortable infection. Eventually you will be able to replace some feedings with formula. This gradual transition is easier for you and the baby.</td>

If there is ever a problem with diarriah, boil some water, and put about 1/4 cup of plain, white rice in there, if the child is fussy about the taste, put a couple of small pinches of sugar and very small pinch of cinnamin in there and mix it up.

<td>can i feed my 3 month old infant rice cereal?</td>
<td>You're the mom, you 'can' do whatever you feel is right. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends waiting 6-9 months before introducing solid foods. There's no biological reason to give a baby that young sollids, in that they are limited in their ability to digest it. Often with babies you'll see that the food 'goes right through' them, fully intact. Their gut is still developing it's ability to digest foods in the first year, and introducing solids too soon can cause lead to significant issues, especially if you're breastfeeding, or if your family is prone to allergies. What would be the benefit to offer the baby something it's not physically able to truly digest yet? Good luck with your decision, you're the only one who can truly make it! If you decide to offer the cereal and change your mind later, there's no reason why you can't just stop giving it, and you can always wait a little longer and offer it when your baby is a little more developmentally ready for it.

She never had a speaking problem, but she was a terribly messy eater (couldn't lick her lips) and since she couldn't properly move food around her mouth she had a huge problem with choking.  Like she says, every kid should be able to blow raspberries!!

She did finally get it done at age 7, but we had to put her in a twilight sleep to do it.  She was a little swolen for a few days and fully healed within a week.  The stitches stung a bit the first day or two, but she was happy to have ice cream &amp; apple sauce.  She had to teach herself how to use it since she had worked around it for so long but after a few months we almost forgot she had it done.  It's been over a year now &amp; she is so happy with the results.  Her goal was to be able to touch her nose... she's still working on it :)

But, nutritionally they no longer need to be fed  at night after 12 weeks and if you continue, which I did, then it just becomes habit for them.  Here's what I was told.  Feed them well before bed, then place them in bed and then let them sleep.  When he wakes up, let him fuss and even cry a little because he will be teaching himself how to fall asleep by himself.  A priceless lesson.  It seems hard and/or cruel, but, it really is worth it.  Of course you can always go in if he gets hysterical, but, most of the time the just need to practice this skill.  My daughter woke up and cried 3-4 times and it killed me to not go in, but, that was the last night I had to worry about it.  She slept thru the night after that.  Good luck!</td>

<td>What do I do for a newborn with colic?</td>
<td>Firstly, colic seems to be a 'generalist' term used by people to describe the set of symptoms that include irritability, prolonged crying for no external reason, baby not wanting to settle, baby 'rejecting' or  not 'taking to' breast milk.

The clinical definition of colic is when a baby cries for more than three hours continuously and at a time, for more than three days in a row.  So, you can see that there might be many reasons for the crying that is not related to 'wind' or 'constipation'.

However...

At about two weeks of age, my baby developed colic symptoms.  We tried everything, rocking, burping, sitting upright, wearing her in a sling, bathing, tickling and nothing seemed to work.  Eventually we decided to try elimiating foods from my diet that are known to commonly 'cause colic which had stunning success.

It was difficult for me as I had to totally eliminate the following (you might like to try some of them?):
 * dairy
 * artificial sweeteners
 * fruit juices
 * onion
 * garlic
 * cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, corn, peas etc)
 * spices
 * wheat products (including bread, pasta etc)

Also, we used a preparation called "Infant's Friend" which contains Cassia oil, magnesium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate, anise oil and dill oil.  Aaliyah loved the flavour and it helped her to sleep for longer during particularly 'horrid' bouts of colic.

Other than that, though, you might like to try any number of suggestions in the book "101 ways to calm the crying".  A fabulous resource.

Rocking, giving baby tummy time, massage, tickling, removing 'triggers' from your diet (if breast feeding) can all help.  

Having a 'colicky baby' can be very stressful, frsutrating and challenging for any parent particularly if this is your first child.  Babies can pick up on the anxiety around them which can make their colic worse.  It's important for you to have time to yourself.  If you're feeling overwhelmed, you need to take a breatk.  Call a friend or relative and have them look after your baby for even an hour or two while you get some sleep, go for a walk, have a bath or whatever else relaxes you.</td>

A lot of new baby toys are colored in red, black, and white because they are high-contrast to each other.

<td>how do you train babies to sleep through the night?</td>
<td>I think the key is to start getting them used to good habits as early as possible:

Day time is fun time: light, music, voices, play, going out for walks, taking a bath, etc.

In the evening, keep to a regular ritual - dinner, bath, bottle, story, lullaby, for example - and then at night, when your baby wakes up, stay serious: keep the room dark or mostly dark, change only dirty diapers (not just wet ones), feed and then put back in bed, don't talk to the baby any more than you have to. 

In this way, babies learn the difference between day and night and will find that daytime is much more fun.

We all wake up during the night, the trick is learning how to get back to sleep and this is a skill that each baby acquires at a different age.</td>

Have they excessively had bowel movements?  If this is the case then something might be irritating their tummy.  I would talk to the doc about it though.  My son had to be switched to Soy formula early on as he was allergic to something in the regular formula and he was ending up having traces of blood in his stool.  You might want to have the stool checked out.  Then you will have to try and figure out what you are doing differently then you were before.</td>

<td>is purified water also best for mixing with formula milk for newborn baby?</td>
<td>A newborn should have "sterile" water because their immune system is basically zilch. Simple things that an adult could get from contaminated water would probably just make you uncomfortably ill, but in a newborn this could be life-threatening either due to an inability to fight off infection or because of the resulting diarrhea and dehydration. The definition of sterile is open to debate. A lot of pediatricians feel that tap water may be sufficient and boiling is unnecessary. There are others who are a bit more conservative and suggest boiling. Until what age is another matter of debate. A good rule of thumb is when your child puts that first dead bug in his mouth, boiling may be a moot issue. Certainly well water should be boiled if used at all. Bottled water is also controversial. Water labelled as nursery water is usually fine, but not all bottled water is actually "sterile". Some bottled spring waters are actually not as sterile as plain tap water. Likewise not all "spring waters" actually come from springs. Some are actually municipal waters put in a bottle. Finally, my 2 cents on fluoride. I believe the AAP actually recommends the addition of fluoride at / after the age of 6 months. Therefore, the use of fluoride in your baby's formula water is not essential until that age. Interestingly, the use of fluoride is actually regarded by most pediatricians as one of the most notable advances in medicine of the 20th century. While I don't disagree with the fact that there are lethal doses of fluoride, I would have to remind you that everything we ingest routinely for our own health can be lethal or harmful in excess amounts. For example, ingesting similar amounts of iron can also be lethal, and just consuming too much iron via supplementation can also cause serious health problems, but most people do not call for elimination of iron from our diet. The incidence of childhood dental decay has dropped tremendously in the last 20-30 years since the introduction of fluoride into drinking water, but it actually goes further than that. Better dental health also leads to fewer medical problems in later adulthood.</td>

In my experience with children I have found that the least thought of and least expensive things work better than those sold in the store.  So to answer your question what worked best for her ...a bag of frozen food out of the freezer...babies generally put everything in their mouths and this crazy idea worked well. good luck these are tough times for babies.</td>

<td>How to increase milk for lactation ?</td>
<td>There are a couple main factors that seem to contribute to your milk supply:
1 - frequency of feedings (when your child goes through growth spurts - she will naturally increase your milk supply by needing to eat more frequently)
2 - mother is eatting a sufficient number of calories (i've known mom's who have taken to aggressive of a diet trying to lose baby weight lose their supply of milk.  breastfeeding burns approximately 400 calories a day so the mom's caloric intake is definitely a factor)
3 - staying sufficiently hydrated - your milk supply will also depend on how much water/liquids you drink.  i've noticed a direct correlation of how much i've drank and my milk supply.

your body sometimes will go through natural weaning stages where your milk somewhat decreases for a couple days.  to counteract that the above 3 factors should be tried first.  if this does not help - you can try taking fenugreek (natural herbal supplement found in places like whole foods).  this works well for some mothers, but not for all.

good luck!  it's definitely a worthwhile endeavor.</td>

<td>Are cloth diapers better?</td>
<td>There are pros and cons to each, while cloth diapers are better for the environment there is some debate over whether they are actually better for your baby. Diapering is one of the few areas having to do with pregnancy, or infancy in which we actually have made very big strides with technology for the health and comfort of your baby. Todays diapers are amazing. They do an outstanding job of protecting your baby's skin, and clothes, lol. Some infants have extremely senstive skin and may be irritated by certain brands or disposable diapers alltogether. And by the way, diaper manufacturers are leaning towards using materials in their diapers that are biodegradable. There is less and less plastic and more and more of the clothlike materials going into them. I suspect that before too many more years pass, the argument of cloth over disposble will not be able to use the rationale that disposables are bad for the environment. And by the way, cheaper, maybe. depends on how cheap and often ineffective you want to get. And then you may be faced with new clothes and diapers to buy. Check out some pricing on some decent clothe reusable diapers before you make any choices based on price.</td>

<td>Why do people not talk to babies normal?</td>
<td>Some people think that baby talk, the sing-songy talk that some adults use around babies, is easier for them to understand and is more soothing to them.

"Researchers such as Rima Shore (1997) believe that baby talk is an important part of the emotional bonding process, and contributes to mental development. It plays a role in teaching the child the basic function and structure of language. Studies have shown that even replying to babble with meaningless babble aids language acquisition, because even though the babble itself conveys no logical meaning, the interaction teaches infants that speech is bidirectional communication."

FWIW I agree with you. I hate baby talk.</td>

I used prefolds with velcro-closure diaper wraps exclusively for about the first three months of my son's life and was very happy with them.  When he got older, I bought samples of several different kinds of cloth diapers.  I found I like FuzziBunz for at night, MotherEase One-Size when it's hot and I don't want to put a cover over the diaper so his skin can breathe, and prefolds for going out of the house.

Also, I found that breastfeeding (or giving a bottle) during take-off and landing is helpful for reducing the discomfort that babies feel in their ears because of the change in pressure.

 If you do buy a seat for the infant (which I recommend for bigger babies and toddlers since the flight is long), bring a car seat.  The "Sit N Stroll" car  seat (Yahoo! Shopping has it) is one that works extremely well in both the airline seat and as a stroller going through airports, etc.  We used one in our California to Europe fligtht this past summer.

Bring the baby's familiar blanket, some toys, and bottles/snacks that your little one likes.

<td>what is good for colic?</td>
<td>Most of the time, the cause of the baby's colic cannot be determined, and it can't be prevented. Proper feeding techniques and appropriate diet can be helpful.

Since colic has been part of the human condition for a long time, many treatments have become part of folklore. There is no treatment that has been scientifically proven to be effective in a large number of infants. Generally speaking, medicines are not advised and are not very useful for treating colic. Once they are sure that the problem is colic and not something more serious, parents should trust that the baby is healthy and that things will get better with time.Colicky infants are often very sensitive to their environment. It may help to keep the baby's environment as quiet and soothing as possible. Avoid sudden or loud noises. Hold the baby in a soothing manner, without vigorous jostling or bouncing. Comfort the baby by holding or rocking him or her while wrapped in secure swaddling in a soft blanket. Soft background music may help. The baby may also respond to swinging in a baby swing or going for a ride in a stroller.Some infants can have abdominal pain from certain proteins in cow's milk. Colicky infants who are on a formula made from cow's milk may benefit from a different kind of formula. Options should be discussed with the healthcare provider.It is important for parents to develop a support system. This system should provide some brief periods in which the parents can be away from the baby. A trusted, experienced relative or neighbor can often be on call to fill in for a few hours when the parent needs a break. This break can help prevent child abuse.</td>

<td>When do children start to talk?</td>
<td>I am the mother of five kids, and these are my observations.  Your baby has been talking to you since he was born, and you have, most likely, been talking back.  It is a mother's natural inclination to make conversation with her baby, even though they may not understand each other.  As time goes on, it becomes clear that baby understands a lot of what you say, though you may not understand him.  Perhaps, though, you have noticed him using certain sounds to get something.  My most recent baby had a good grasp of 1-2-3, for instance, by about 8 months old.  It was more clear by the rhythm of the sounds than by the actual words what she was saying.  Rosie is 18 months old now, and she talks all the time, in complete sentences.  I attribute this to her listening to a lot of stories, and to her large family talking to her constantly.  I am the only one who understands her, as she does not speak clearly.  If I consider her body language, tone, general sounds, and other circumstances, I can figure it out.  But if she tries to tell me about what her sisters are doing in the bedroom, I haven't got a clue.  

So, here is my advice!  Keep talking to your baby, read to your baby, listen to him and try to figure out what he is saying, but don't stress about it.  He is young.  If all else is normal, you should be able to understand most of what he says by two or two and a half.</td>

<td>Am I losing my milk?</td>

Making sure you're getting enough calories, enough water, and enough rest will definitely help on your side.  If you still notice a decrease - you might want to try Fenugreek.  I also have a 6 month old and am experiencing the same thing and noticed that taking Fenugreek helped me.    I also think that at this age - we no longer will be going through the full &amp; sore stage since our body will no longer overproduce like they used to.  If she's growing, and still has 4 wet diapers - she's probably doing just fine with the milk you're producing.

Alarms cannot always be heard from other parts of house, or get drowned out by loud noises.  Have an alarm as a backup if you want but ALSO...
Install plexiglass shields as much a 5 or 6 feet high.  This may be costly.  But they cannot be scaled if you have no furniture up against them, and if 6 ft high, not even if kid pushes furniture over.
Keep doors locked and be hypervigilant.  That's a big part of what we did with our son.  I just had to be within 2 feet of him at all times.  We were really bonded.  And we went to the park a lot instead of hanging out on the deck.
Baby will gain a fear of heights in a couple of years-- then you can go as much as 4 feet away and just keep an eye on him/her.

i'm also a new mom and have looked a lot into this question.  there is a lot of peer/familial pressure to start babies earlier since it was a common practice before (you probably were started on rice cereal early).  also - if you're hoping it will get your baby to sleep through the night - studies have shown that this is not really true and i can attest for from my own baby - that this did not help him sleep through the night.

best of luck!</td>

<td>How many women breastfeed after 6 months?</td>
<td>"While 70.9 percent of mothers in US hospitals initiated breastfeeding in 2003, only 36.2 percent were still partially breastfeeding at six months of age and only 14.2 percent were exclusively breastfeeding at this age.  The American Academy of Pediatrics states that exclusive breastfeeding is the ideal nutrition for the first 6 months and should continue for at least twelve months and thereafter for as long as mutually desired."

I think my daughter was still breastfeeding just at night to go to sleep when she was three. With my encouragement, she stopped when she had her 4th birthday. (sort of a "big girl" thing, I think I spun it as. If truly "child-led" it would have gone on even longer, I think.) I think if the mother is feeling fed up with it, that is a reason to encourage weaning or limiting breast feeding -- at least after the first 12 months or so.</td>

All babies spit up — in that bubbling up, wet burp way.

<td>Are cloth or disposable diapers better for babies?</td>
<td>Cloth diapers are MUCH cheaper than disposables, even factoring in the cost of the detergent, water, and energy to wash and dry them.  They are more work, though they're not that inconvenient when you set up a good routine and stick with it.  There's an environmental cost to both kinds of diapers, though I personally think that disposables are worse for the environment.

But none of that answers your question. Which is best for babies?  It partially depends on the baby.  Some babies react to the chemicals in disposable diapers and get horrible rashes.  Others get rashes in cloth because they are less absorbent (cloth diapers need to be changed more frequently than disposables for this reason).  I've read that mice exposed to the absorbency chemicals in disposable diapers developed asthma-like symptoms; I've never heard of any studies correlating the rise in the incidence in asthma in kids with the increase in the use of disposable diapers, but there may be a relationship.  Kids in cloth diapers tend to toilet train earlier than kids in disposables because they can feel the wetness when they pee in their diaper; it helps them learn the cause-and-effect of peeing in their pants.  My overall assessment is that cloth is better than disposables.

Have you considered that cloth and disposable diapers aren't the only options for dealing with your baby's waste?  Many traditional cultures don't use diapers at all; caregivers learn to tune in to babies' body language and timing patterns and take the babies to appropriate potty places.  This practice is known as elimination communication, natural infant hygiene, or infant potty training.  It can be combined with diaper use (even full-time diaper use, just removing the diaper when you take your baby to the potty) and it's not as hard as it might sound.  I've been doing it with my 11-month-old son since he was two weeks old.  Babies whose elimination needs are responded to in this way are generally toilet trained between 18 months and 2 years old, considerably earlier than the average in our society.</td>

<td>I need christmas help this year for my 8 month old daughter. Where do I get help? In Indianapolis?</td>
<td>Try re-wrapping a couple toys and outfits she already has.  The lady I babysit for does this for Christmas with her little girl, because babies don't know the difference.  She won't even know that it's not new.  You could also try putting photoa in an album for her for the future  or make a memory box- you could write her a letter telling her how much she means to you and save it for when she has her own baby.  You could put that in there, along with a couple of your favorite baby pictures and maybe what she wore home from the hospital and a favorite baby blankie - you could even add to it throughout the years.  I'm making one for my four-month-old.  I put: a couple pictures, her halloween costume, a diaper of each size, a bow from her first Christmas (you can make one out of almost anything), and I plan on putting a lot more in there.  I've also saved all of her cards so she can see how many people care about her and read them when she's old enough to understand.  You can do a lot of projects with scraps from home.  Try finding a DIY website.  I'm constantly working on projects.  For my husband, I put together a scrapbook of my favorite memories and favorite pictures of us together.  You could make a collage with pictures and her birth announcements.  Homemade are always better - they come from the heart and they don't have to cost a fortune.  Also, your fiancee should understand. Christmas isn't about presents - maybe you should just plan a day together and make a no present policy or make an agreement that you have a $20 limit to see what you can each come up with - my husband and I have a $50 limit at Christmas.  Or Agree to make each other something because it means more.  Christmas isn't about getting - it's about spending time with family, and that's what he should understand - spending time TOGETHER is what Christmas is all about.</td>

 Socially speaking, if you choose not to get the vaccine, you may get the illness and expose others to this illness making them ill (not as ill if they didn't get the vaccine) but nevertheless, you will be a carrier of that illness, so it is wise to get vaccinations.

Keep the room dark and limit possible distractions.  Playing classical music or white noise can help.  Pacifiers help soothe babies, and they can reduce the risk of SIDS as well.

If you doctor thinks it is OK, consider adding baby food to your baby's diet (if you haven't already).  Most of the time, babies wake up because they are hungry.  The solid food should stay in the belly longer than formula would.

You may not come home in time for Christmas, this I know. 
But my weary heart still rejoices for you shall see a new and glorious morn.
By your cradle I shall stand 
With dreams of my little boy becoming a man. 
This hospital incubator is not what I see 
Instead a manger hugging my baby so sweetly.
Early did you arrive on this green earth
Sixteen weeks early I gave birth
It was frightening yet so divine
To meet this heavenly baby of mine.

And so in my own way I shall praise
Joy to the world for all of our days
Because our troubles, little one, will soon be miles away
I promise to you in this hospital bed you shall not stay
You will come home for the holidays and rejoice
And how I will cry when first I hear your voice
Singing and laughing and smiling with such joy
And I shall celebrate this New Year with my little boy.

As I hold your tiny hands in mine
I can already see how your soul shines
On your very first Noel this year
I sing to you as I hold you near and dear:

“Jesus the Lord was that baby so small,
Laid down to sleep in a humble stall;
Then came the star and it stood overhead,
shedding its light 'round His little bed.
Dear baby Jesus, how tiny Thou art,
I'll make a place for Thee in my heart,
And when the stars in the heavens I see,
Ever and always I think of Thee.”

Once your child is at least 1 year of age and is at least 20 pounds, he can ride forward-facing. Move the shoulder straps to the slots that are at or above your child's shoulders. On many convertible seats, the top harness slots must be used when the seat is in the forward-facing position. Check the instructions to be sure.

<td>How much liquid tagamet do I give a newborn for acid reflux? I don't remember....Please HELP!!!?</td>
<td>The answer is that it depends on the baby's weight. Everybody else is right though, this is something you should see your pediatrician about. I suspect the basis for your question is that your baby is extremely fussy. There can be a number of reasons for a fussy baby from colic, to temperament, to infection to a formula intolerance to reflux disease. It should never be assumed that a baby has reflux disease until these possiblities at the very minimum have been considered. Since you are trying to "remember" the dose, I suspect you may have already had a child with reflux disease, which would raise the odds that your subsequent child would also have reflux disease. As for doing an upper GI, there is actually not a lot of agreement on how useful this is. All babies reflux ( this is a fancy way of saying spit up) To actually observe this on an upper GI means you've observed a baby doing what you already know he does. If you don't see it on an upper GI (maybe 5 minutes depending on how patient your radiology tech is) only means you didn't see him spit up during those 5 minutes. There actually is not a lot of correlation between the upper GI and the degree of symptoms of reflux disease. An upper GI can be useful to rule out other problems though.
This really is something you should see your pediatrician about. I think most pediatricians would be very, very unhappy to find that a parent gave an infant tagamet on their own.</td>

<td>IS CIRCUMCiSION NECESSARY?</td>
<td>I am uncut and it hasn't been a hinderance in any relationship I've been in. It doesn't bother women at all, unless they're shallow bimbos.
Yes, it helps keep the maintenance down. If someone who is uncut doesn't wash it, it will develop smegma deposits.
Smegma is the white pasty substance that can smell bad, but it isn't an infection. Smegma itself isn't inherently bad. It is simply what the underside of the foreskin produces to keep the glans (head of the penis) in a supple state. The smegma builds up after time, and begins to smell bad.  That is when smegma gets recognized as a bad thing, but only because the man failed to clean himself like he should.
Those who are circumsized don't have the foreskin of course to produce smegma. So of course, causes the glans to become weathered and less sensitive.

What I have noticed is that the glans of an uncircumsized penis looks as though it hasn't aged from younger years at all. Circumsized penises have ones that look like they have wrinkles and all dried up looking with the same complexion as the rest of the shaft. Not that I look at that all the time, it's just something I've noticed.

Since I'm not circumsized and do have a more sensitive glans, it almost seems too sensitive. This is up for debate on what is better to have. Some people think the sensitivy advantage is a good thing, but then there's those like me who feel a sensory overload to where it hurts or actually becomes numb as far as recognizing pleasure. 
Sexually it's not really a problem. When the uncircumsized glans is bare and rubs against something without any type of lubrication....there will be pain. 
On the other hand I do not necessarily envy those who have been circumsized.  
It is especially unwise for a man to decide to get circumsized after his infant years because it seems to heal slower or something, they also have to deal with it being bare and for it to develop a tough skin. it's just pointless.
My dad did this solely to follow his hollow religious beliefs...and what did he get out of it?

<td>I am thinking of adopting,or Fosterparentingthere are so many agencies out there wheredo i look or pick from.?</td>
<td>There is a big difference between foster parenting and adopting.  You could become a foster parent and later if the chid becomes available, you could try to adopt.  I am not a big fan of Catholic COmmunity Services but you can ask them, they do that sort of thing and i am sure there is one in Wisconsin.  

Warning when you are a foster parent (I have been one) you are required to get a license.  Agencies will usually pay for the training.  There is more than one type of license.  One kind means you will accept emergency kids, a moments notice, and they will be stabilized by you, only can stay a certain lenght of time, can be heart breaking.  There is such thing as foster-adopt and you need to check with the equivelent of Department of child and welfare in WIsconisn for that.  

When you are a foster parent, you will probably not get babies.  You will get children.  Unless you specify.  I wanted children, not babies, so that was not a problem.  Babies are in high demand, they are less "broken".  

Foster kids come in all shapes and forms, I have had ones that steal, lie, have been in 50!! schools and homes, I have also had two sisters who had only been to one foster home before mine and even though they had problems, I was able to find the resources they needed, see them through the whole process of the foster system and they are now adopted to a nice family in my home-town.  But those stories are few and far between.  I grew to love three of the 5 foster kids I helped.  

It takes a special person to want to do this.  

Lutheran Services is a good choice.  Not as bossy as Catholic Community Services.  

Have fun and good luck.</td>

<td>How can I put my 9 month old to sleep without letting her cry it out or rocking her forever?</td>
<td>You can create a bedtime routine...This will help baby to anticipate that bedtime is about to come.
For example you can feed her, and then take a bath,
and then dim the light and read some books, or sing songs..then turn out the lights and say goodnight..you can still rock her to sleep or sing songs..use some white noise.

You can also breastfeed her before she goes night night..Be sure not to let her sleep at the breast. It IS possible to do so, however it will be harder later if you have to wean her...


Our son was colicky until 4 months old and wouldn't go to sleep easily..the routine helped him settle down. It takes about a couple weeks for the adjustment to really work.
We would also use white noise, like a fan or we even had recorded the vaccum cleaner noise on a CD and we would play it at night.

Car rides work too, but it's not fun going out in the winter..

You can also try to carry your baby in a sling, this worked great for naps. Carrying you baby a lot will make night time smoother..

Make sure also you baby naps well during the day..At 9 months she may still need 2 naps..be sure her second nap is not too close to her night time.
You can also take her on the stroller for her naps.</td>

<td>It can certainly be done. But when you make cheese you remove some of the fat from the milk, so it would be slightly different (nutritionally).

Also, infants get their water from breast milk, which would not be as present in sufficient quantity in the cheese.

Breast milk (not cheese) is the perfect food for infants, so the milk will always be a better option.

BTW, breast milk is high in sugar and sweet, not sour as stated in the previous answer.</td>

I remember they made me supplement because he was so lethargic it took him forever to feed and he was out of the lights too long.  They would yell at me when he didn't feed fast enough. I am so sorry you had to go through all of that.  My son had a complicated birth as well and has Cerebral Palsy as a result.  I think if they had caught his jaundice a bit sooner he would have been able to be discharged sooner but they didnt even check for ABO till the next day and I had complications so in our dark room we couldnt see he was so yellow.  I think that when parents blood are like mine and my husbands they ought to check for it just like they do RH factors.  ;)  I am so glad to hear he is healthy.

<td>Do you agree Breastfeeding is best?</td>
<td>I think breastfeeding is awesome! I breastfed my 1st son until he was 2 and currently nurse #2 (he's 9 months) Here are my reasons:

1) It is the best for baby. It is the perfect food for baby. Baby gets the protection of your antibodies so the immunity you developed after every virus you have ever fought off is passed to baby. Less colic, ear infections allergies, SIDs etc

2) Best for mom. Lower rates of breast cancer in women who BF. Faster loss of preg weight. Helps you to bond with baby.


3)Easier and more convenient: instead of getting up at 2 AM to make a bottle you just stick your boob in his mouth! Free food! You always have food handy.

4) Great soother: nursing calms and relaxes upset baby. Great on planes!

5) When everyone else is stressing about weaning their kid from a bottle you can have a laugh because you don't have to deal with that!

As for nursing in public who cares what other people think? It is not like you are whipping off you shirt and exposing your whole boob. Girls in swimsuits show more boob than a nursing mom. There are many great nursing shirts out there but an average long shirt works fine.

The only time someone gave me lip was a lady in a restaurant loudly exclaiming to her friend that, "If she HAS to do that in public, she should at least go to the bathroom!" I turned to her and said, "Do you like to eat your lunch while sitting on a public toilet? If it bothers you DON'T LOOK!"

It isn't your problem if other people are offended by nursing, it is theirs!

<td>How many ounces of breastmilk should my 5 week old son be getting?</td>
<td>There is no one right amount to feed babies, but there are some good rules of thumb. Most newborns take two or three ounces at a time and by 4 weeks, the average amount has gone up to four ounces. 

But in real life this may vary quite a bit from day to day and from baby to baby. It's best to stay flexible and to let your baby set the amount. You don't need to coax him to finish a bottle or stop him if he still acts hungry. Babies are born with a wonderful, sophisticated mechanism that prompts them to eat until they are full and to stop when their nutritional and fluid needs are satisfied.</td>

If she is fed, dry diaper and you know she isn't sick then try letting her cry for 15 minutes, check on her and then add additional 5 min.

<td>while breastfeeding what are some good ways to keep up milk supply?</td>
<td>Here are some ideas that may help you to increase your milk supply. Look them over and consider which might work for you.

Contact a local La Leche League Leader for information and support. The section of our Web site entitled "Finding a Local LLL Group" at http://www.lalecheleague.org/leaderinfo.html will help you do this. 
Encourage your baby to breastfeed frequently and for as long as he will. 
Offer both breasts at each feeding. Allow baby to stay at the first breast as long as he is actively sucking and swallowing. Offer the second breast when baby slows down or stops. "Finish the first breast first," is a good general rule. (This technique gives baby lots of the fatty “hindmilk.”) 
Baby should end the feeding. He may do this by falling asleep and detaching from the breast after about 10 to 30 minutes of active sucking and swallowing. 
Be sure baby is latched on and positioned correctly at the breast, that is, lips should be on the areola (the darker skin area), well behind the nipple. An LLL Leader can help fine-tune positioning as well as suggest ideas to ease soreness. Breastfeeding isn’t supposed to hurt. 
A sleepy baby may benefit from “switch nursing” that is, switching breasts two or three times during each feeding. Switch breasts when baby's sucking slows down and he swallows less often. 
All of baby's sucking should be at the breast. Limit or stop pacifier use while encouraging baby to nurse more effectively. If you are supplementing, even temporarily, you can give the supplement by spoon, cup, or with a nursing supplementer. These can be viewed and purchased from our online catalogue at http://www.lalecheleague.org/catalog.html. Contact an LLL Leader for assistance in using these.</td>

<td>Is anyone familiar with microcephaly?</td>
<td>Microcephaly is a medical condition in which the circumference of the head is smaller than normal because the brain has not developed properly or has stopped growing.  Microcephaly can be present at birth or it may develop in the first few years of life.  It is most often caused by genetic abnormalities that interfere with the growth of the cerebral cortex during the early months of fetal development.  It is associated with Down’s syndrome, chromosomal syndromes, and neurometabolic syndromes.  Babies may also be born with microcephaly if, during pregnancy, their mother abused drugs or alcohol, became infected with a cytomegalovirus, rubella (German measles), or varicella (chicken pox) virus, was exposed to certain toxic chemicals, or had untreated phenylketonuria (PKU).  Babies born with microcephaly will have a smaller than normal head that will fail to grow as they progress through infancy.  Depending on the severity of the accompanying syndrome, children with microcephaly may have mental retardation, delayed motor functions and speech, facial distortions, dwarfism or short stature, hyperactivity, seizures, difficulties with coordination and balance, and other brain or neurological abnormalities.  Some children with microcephaly will have normal intelligence and a head that will grow bigger, but they will track below the normal growth curves for head circumference.</td>

<td>Babies of African and Asian descent are usually born with brown eyes that stay brown. Caucasian babies are often born with steel gray or dark blue eyes; they may stay gray or blue or turn green, hazel, or brown by the time they're 9 months old. That's because a child's irises (the colored part of the eye) may gain more pigment in the months after she's born, but they won't get "lighter" or more blue. (Green, hazel, and brown eyes actually have more pigment than grey or blue eyes, even if they appear lighter in color.)</td>

So "dada" is a middle mouth sound(or end of the tongue sound) ... and "mama" is a lips sound (or front of the mouth).

<td>My son is 3 1/2 months old?</td>
<td>You should definitely talk to your pediatrician about this one. I wouldn't say going by what the baby wants is always best. Just because he's crying for more doesn't mean that he's still hungry. Babies are smarter than we give them credit for and if he's figured out that you will give him more when he's done if he keeps crying then he will continue in that manner. I'm NOT saying you should attempt to put your baby on a diet or anything like that but talk to your pediatrician and find out what is normal for his age and weight and make sure that you're not giving him more than that at each feeding. If he makes a habit of overeating now, it'll be a hard habit to break later. You really shouldn't have started cereal until your baby was at least 4 months old but since you have already, simply increasing the amount of formula at the feedings might be the solution or stretching the time between feedings. Try playing with baby and getting his mind off feeding for as long as possible. Again, talk to your pediatrician and let him/her help you decide what's best for your little one. Every baby is different. Good luck!</td>

<td>My new born baby cries hystercially in the early mornings for long hours? Will this affect her health?</td>
<td>It could be colic as everyone else's said BUT, as a mother of THREE (3) healthy babies - ALL of them cried a lot. There are some nights and days that they cry not as bad. 

This is something you should not worry too much. 

Holding your infant more often will help. Even when they are already asleep. They like your smell (especially Mom's), the beating of your heart, and mostly the warmth of your skin. I tried this after I have read an article from the Parents Magazine/Baby Magazine (available in Babies 'R' Us FREE). Applying what I read which I believe could help me and the baby is no big deal at all. 

As much as I wanted to do nothing after having that long labor, I'd rather hold and comfort my baby. You can nap with him/her in bed - obviously you all need that. Keeping close contact with an infant really helps. Doing so could create a stronger bond between you two. My son who just turned one this month is a true sweetheart. We are inseparable. 

Also, when she gets a little older, you may want to create a routine on what time she goes to bed so she will get used to it. We started our son at 6 mos every 8-8:30 we put him to bed and we never go beyond. Of course, he wakes up at least 4-5 times but BEING PATIENT is the key to all. Now, he is one as I mentioned earlier and he goes to bed around the same time.

Good luck to you!</td>

With my second i had to be a little bit more careful on what juice i gave him and how much i gave him.  My first suggestion is to sick with the baby juices from any of the brand of baby food out there.  Remember this juice is usually pure. Other brands put more sugar in the product so go with the more pure juice. Second watering down is key specially if your giving juices like apple or pear.  These type of juices are very acidtic and can mean cramps for the little guys or girls.  My third suggestion is to start out with less and add more, like 1 ounce juice to 4 oz water.

<td>does any one know how to take care of african american mexican mix baby hair?</td>
<td>It depends on the babies hair type. African American hair does not produce its own oils. So we have to put oils in our hair. I had a friend who was mexican and her baby was half african american and he ended up with his daddys hair. She did not have the babies daddy around to help with his hair so she didnt know what to do and she refused to listen to anyone. Her baby ended up with VERY dry scalp and hair and he had sores all over his head. I felt bad for him, but I tried to tell her. If your baby has course dry hair the idea is to keep it moisturized. There are all types of moisturizers at Walmart, usually there is a section in the hair department just for african americans. DO NOT USE HAIR GREASE! The moisturizers wont leave your baby with greasy hair but will make it soft enough for you to at least comb it. Also if you have a boy just keep his hair cut short and moist and for a girl... braids are always cute...but not too tight and keep the scalp moist and buy some braid spritz for it. Washing the hair is another question you might want to ask! If all else fails go to your local beauty shop and get help. Good Luck!</td>

I think it's a great idea.  I would have done that but my maiden name happens to be one that is a very trendy/popular first name for boys and girls.  I think it's a mistake to give a child a name that is too common.  I think a strong family name is a good way to go.  It gives them a sense of pride in their heritage.  If you don't necessarily have that kind of pride in your heritage or strong role models in the family to name the boy after, try to pick something unique but not too exotic, that has a beautiful meaning.</td>

My second child was to be called Dashani Hunter, with the S capitalized, dependent upon sex.  Her father hated it, so we negotiated it down to either Jordan or Riley, and her father flipped a coin while his friend called heads or tails.
So her name was RILEY, finally, and I refused to part with the middle name Hunter, because I had told a good friend of mine that I would name my next child after him (it's his middle name also).

Mid morning snack, some boiled soft carrot slices, or some mellon slices, maybe a craker or two.  Lunch they get a hardboiled egg yolk, some canned or fresh chicken breast that is cut very small and a jar (large) of some veggies based baby food. I also substitute sliced turkey for the chicken. They also get some cheese cubes cut small. Later on, some more cheese and crackers or fruit, followed by some soft and boiled veggies liek green beans or carrots thatare mushy soft. Dinner is often a blender puree of what we have all mixed up. Often, I take something like spaghetti and place some in the blender, sauce and all, pulse it and I have a chuncky food they will eat. I try to make sure they get a mix of fruits, vegetables, grains and protein, although they get a lot of protein from their bottles still. I offer water at each meal to help encourage weaning off the bottle and to help thm learn to get liquids at meal times.

I know that you're about ready to pull your hair out but here are some tips..

Calming a crying baby
Assuming you’ve met his basic needs and he isn’t ill, hungry or in need of a clean nappy, you could try some of the following tried and tested methods for calming your baby:

Put him in a sling and carry him close to you 
Try rocking him. You can hold him in your arms and walk around with him or rock together in a rocking chair. Or you can rock him in his cradle or pram 
Try swaddling him. Some babies feel happier firmly wrapped in a cotton sheet. Swaddling often calms babies because of the comforting contact with something warm and soft and the sense of being held firmly 
Take him out for a walk in the fresh air, either in a sling or in his pram 
Try a car ride round the block. However, this is a desperate measure and not one to get into the habit of using! 
Run a warm bath and get into it with your baby 
Sing to your baby; it may at least drown out his cries for a while and help keep you calm 
Try leaving him to cry for a few minutes - some babies actually need to cry themselves to sleep.

I WOULD DEFINITLY TRY SWADDLING THE BABY... SOME BABIES LIKE TO BE WARM AND SNUG, HOWEVER, WHEN MINE WAS FOUR MONTHS OLD SHE HAD OUT-GROWN THIS.  THE SWING WAS A MIRACLE FOR US.  SOME NIGHTS WE ACTUALLY HAD TO USE IT AS A BED FOR HER SO THAT WE COULD GET A COUPLE WINKS.  WE WOULD NOT HAVE MADE IT WITHOUT THE SWING.</td>

It would be much easier to raise a baby without a father(yea it may be more difficult financially, but then again you can always get childsupport) than to be in a bad relationship.  Don't feel obligated to be with him simply because you are having his child.  It isn't the 1950s anymore.  Best of luck to you!</td>

<td>How long should parents wait before having another baby?</td>
<td>I think there are a lot of decisions that go into family planning and this is something. Above all, make this decision with Daddy.

Mother's health for one, are you ready to have another baby? Can you deal with two toddlers at one time? Of course, this can be really cool later, they have a social peer and close all through life. But then again, the siblings that close in age don't get the spotlight in the family for being the one in that age bracket. Another consideration, if it were a multiple, would you be able to handle MORE than two kids that close in age?

Finances are always a consideration. Of course, people can never really AFFORD to have kids, you just make it work. But if you are seriously strapped for cash right now, more children may not be the best decision. Related, do you have room in your present home for another child? Do you still have all the gear from baby number one or would you need more? CAN YOU AFFORD ALL THOSE DIAPERS? Is your vehicle big enough? Do you intend to work outside the home, and if so can you afford daycare or a nanny? All these things are logistical concerns.

Consider the stress this would put on the family, a blessing to be sure, but anything this big is a stressor, a big big change. Is your marriage good and sturdy? Is your son otherwise happy and well adjusted?

I don't think that neglect is the primary concern here, though it is honorable to consider it. Kids are pretty resilient. I think as long as your home is warm and loving and can otherwise accomodate another baby the rest will fall into place. Actually regarding time management and paying attention, for two children close in age, it isn't all that different from one, except the chasing and supervising part. Chances are soon enough, they will be similar developmentally and can do a lot together. In the meantime what is the difference between one load of baby clothes and two? Baby bottles and sippy cups? Childproofing for one and childproofing for two? You can have them in age appropriate similar activities and practice crowd control when the time comes. They will be far from neglected. They will have you, even if they have to share you, and they will have each other. And you can work in individual time for each child...perhaps put them down for naps at different times so you can spend good solid time with the one that is awake.

If this is an on going problem  then contact the pediatrician as this could turn into a serious problem.  I found prunes worked well, Flax seed oil, and senna work great, Grape juice, pears all will help things move along if it is an occasional thing.
My son had no problems until he turned about 7.  Suddenly he bagan holding it and the problem escilated to the point of him doubling over in severe pain that would last up to an hour several times per day.  after several trips to the ER and to the dr. He was referred to a pediatric gastro enterologist.  His intestines were empty but his colon was full, it would allow small amounts of stool to pass, and he was going everyday so I really just thought he needed more fibre etc.  He is now on a stool softner and a bowl training regime.  Apparantly this is very common in boys between 4 and 9 yrs old. He must sit and try to go after brushing his teeth in the morning. Whether he goes or not is not the issue, he must then try again after supper.  The stool softner he is on makes it all easy to pass but the real trick is the retraining of the bowl.  It seems to be working for us.  Good luck with your neice or nephew....trust me I know how scary this can be.</td>

In general, there is some absorption from any product used on the skin. Only use if your skin is not damaged. There is no evidence that use of skin care products has any negative effect on your nursing baby. When applying to the breast, avoid using around your areola and nipple.

Why would you want a 6 month old baby to sleep all by himself in a darkroom in his own bed, where he cannot feel the warmth of people he loves.

Babies this age generally don't sleep through the night. They will still get hungry and wake up.

However it is a good idea to start a bed time routine, so they can anticipate and learn that night is for sleeping.

A bedtime routine can be set like this:
- playing
- a bath
- a massage or reading books and singing
- nursing
- then going to sleep

To help him go sleep you can rock him, sing him songs, or play a CD with lulabies or white noise (ocean waves, wind,...)

Eventually he will look forward to that loving nurturing time that bedtime is. He will gain confidence and the transition to his own bed/room
will be much easier.</td>

Certain kind of formulas produce more gas than others as well. We've found that Enfamil formula produces the most and Nestle's Good Start is associated with the least gas. If you are currently switching formulas that can also cause bad gas while the stomach is getting used to the change. If you are breast feeding, gas shouldn't be as bad as with formula, but unfortunately every baby is made differently! As long as they are eating and sleeping ok, there isn't a need to worry!</td>

<td>What % of babies born to meth addicted mothers are born healthy?</td>
<td>I don't know what percent but I will give you an educated guess that no baby will be completely normal if their mother used drugs while pregnant, or nursing.

"Don't worry about past drug use; just make sure it was your last.  On the upside: a single use of a drug before you found out you were pregnant isn't likely to have had any effect.  On the downside: continuing to use it during pregnancy could be catastrophic.  Drugs not only cross into the placenta, they can damage it, reducing blood flow to the fetus and restricting fetal growth, particularly that of the head.  It can also lead to miscarriage, premature labor, stillbirth, and stroke at birth, as well as numerous long-term problems for your child.  Among these are chronic diarrhea, irritability, excessive crying, neurological and behavior problems (such as difficulty with impulse control, with paying attention, and with responding to others), motor development deficits, and lower IQ scores.  Certainly, the more the expectant mother uses drugs, the greater the risk to her baby.  But even very occasinal use later on in pregnancy can be hazardous.  For instance, a single use in the third trimester can trigger contractions or an abnormal fetal heartbeat.

Tell your practitioner about any drug use since you've conceived.  As with every aspect of your medical history, the more your doctor or midwife knows, the better care you and your baby will receive.  If you have any difficulty giving up drugs entirely, seek professional help immediately.

Pregnant women who use drugs of any kind - other than those that have been prescribed by a physician who knows they are pregnant - are putting their babies in jeopardy.  Every known illicit drug (including heroin, cocaine, methadone, crack, ecstacy, "ice", LSD, and PCP) and every prescription drug of abuse (including narcotics, tranquilizers, sedatives, and diet pills) can, with continued use, cause serious harm to a developing fetus and/or to your pregnancy.  Check with your practitioner or another knowledgeable doctor about any drugs you've used during pregnancy, or call a hotline.. (1-800-662-HELP for one) to see what effect they could have had.  Then, if you are still using drugs, get professional support (from a certified addiction counselor, an addictionologist, or a treatment center) to help you quit now.  Enrolling in a drug-free-pregnancy program now can make a tremendous difference in the outcome of your pregnancy."

I'd bet everything I own that it would be much more likely to have a baby with defects than to have a somewhat healthy baby from a mother who continues to use drugs throughout her pregnancy.  If this is a personal question please get help immediately.  No one is going to judge you and will help you every step of the way.  If it is for a friend or just someone you know please be there to support her and help her get help.  You'd be saving a baby's life.</td>

Looking back on those years, I'd say the most important thing is not worry about brain development explicitly but just meet them where they're at.  It's frustrating when they pick the same book over and over when they have a wide selection, but that repetition is meeting some need we'll never be able to explain.

<td>I had a wonderful experience using cloth diapers.  I used a reputable diaper service, and we bought the waterproof covers, and we did not have leak problems.  We found the cloth diapers to breathe well, be soft and absorbant, and easy to use.  The only time we dealt with diaper rash was when we switched to disposable.

I think it's all about the parents and caretakers:  using the right sizes, changing often, keeping baby fresh and clean.  Use whatever will cause you to change frequently!</td>

 Many variables. At 6 months many start introducing cerals to the babies diet. This would alter the amount of fluid intake.If the child is on milk or soy formula. And even moreso if baby is on a special more refined formula. But please consult your doctor. Many of us overfeed our children. As long as your baby is comfortable.

My second daughter was jaundice. I was told to breastfeed next to a window so she would get the sunlight.

The heat lamps are NOT better than sunlight. Jaundice is caused by an excesses of bilirubin in the blood stream. A baby's liver either 1) can't break it down or 2) can't break it down fast enough. The sunlight does it for them, naturally, without any doctor's intervention. Putting a child in sunlight won't hurt them either. Humans need sunlight to manufacture certain vitamins in our systems. So, why wrap your baby up in a light therapy blanket when you could take them for a walk outside and reap the same benefits?</td>

<td>Having a child is unlike anything else.  To fully describe it is impossible.  It's scary, overwhelming, and reaquires HUGE amounts of responsibility, but it's also beautiful, and fun, and the love you feel for your child consumes you.  With my son, not a day goes by that I don't look at him and think, "WOW! What a MIRACLE you are!"  I could never really understand the parent/child relationship until I became a parent myself.  Sometimes I want to pull my hair out with worry or stress, and sometimes I want to kiss and hug him like crazy, but the love I felt when he was first placed in my arms two years ago is just as strong, and I find myself loving him even more as he grows and learns new things.  Parenting is the hardest job in the world.  Being responsible for a little life and how they turn out is an overwhelming task.  But I wouldn't trade one day of it, and I love my little boy more than life itself!</td>

If you're breastfeeding do it as long as possible.  The only reason why I would think she thought you should start using formula is because at six months infants need to start getting more iron than your breast milk is offering but rice cereal offers that.

<td>Check his legs, or the injection site. My son broke out in a rash after his 4 month shots, but it was from the adhesive on the bandage not from the shots. They can also get knots in the muscles where the shot was that irritates them. If so, use a warm heating pad or something similar and try to massage and/or excercise his legs to work out the knot and work in the medicine, though none should be remaining after too long.  For his next set of shots, try giving him a dose of tylenol about 30 minutes before his shots, ask your doctor what his appropriate dosing is.

I also tried letting the doctor/nurse hold the baby, or be the one that my baby sees while getting the shots while I hold him, so that I could be the "rescuer" after the fact and he wouldn't associate me so easily with the pain. I also nursed him immediately afterwards for comfort.

Let her play in her highchair with cheerios, eventually as she puts them in her mouth she'll realize that they taste good.

<td>Does breastfeeding hurt?</td>
<td>Oh sweetie.. you have been misguided.  It's a good thing I came along.  As long as the baby is latched on correctly it does NOT hurt in the least.  You know that you need to get some help when it hurts.  For the first few weeks it may be slightly  sensitive as your nipples do need to toughen up a bit but it does not hurt.  As for when they get teeth it still does not hurt if a baby is latched on correctly because his mouth will be open wide and babies suckle with their top lip and their tongue on the bottom.. not their bottom lip, so their tongue is on top of those little biters.  If your baby does started to bite you quickly take him off and by that time your baby will be old enough to realize that you don't like that.

If you have any other questions about breast feeding you can contact me at ahundredloons@hotmail.com  Breast feeding is one of the best gifts you could give your baby.  I wouldn't say it's easy at first.. sometimes it can be downright frustrating, but my baby is almost seven months now and we both absolutly love it.  It's very enjoyable and soooo easy.

<td>Will my breastmilk clear up my baby's eye mucus?</td>
<td>Oh my gosh, people frighten me with their lack of knowledge of such a basic body function. 

Yes, breastmilk is SAFE for you to use anywhere on your baby. It is good for rashes, cuts, chapped skin, and more. It has antibacterial and antiviral properties and has been proven to *kill cancer cells*. I think if breastmilk can handle a cancer cell, it can surely handle a little pink eye! ;) You can cook with it, it is considered a 'clear fluid' that can be given to sick babies where formula can not, it carries your own baby's DNA! It's amazing stuff!

My son gets conjunctivitis every time he gets a cold and until we quit nursing I would just do a little in the morning, and a little at night, and within a couple of days he was fine. This was much easier than antibiotics (which are harmful to your body, even when they are necessary) which can sting and burn and have risks of side effects (every medication does, no matter how simple it is).

<td>Is it true that starting baby food early will increase likelihood of food allergies in babies?</td>
<td>I have a 7 month old son and he's had a slow, gradual introduction to foods. We have a family history of dairy allergies (his 3 brothers and dad), so that in addition to the fact that babies can't tolerate cows milk before 1 yr old I've avoided anything dairy altogether. 

We started with rice cereal mixed into the breastmilk, but it didn't do much. At about 4-5 months we introduced some fruits to his diet because he was having infrequent bowel movements and we wanted something to help him "move it along". I started mixing a little bit of rice cereal into applesauce, pears, sweet potatoes, etc. to add texture at about 6 months when he started disliking the stuff plain due to texture. Just follow your baby's cues. Also, watch out for rice and bananas. both are "firming" foods and can cause your baby unnessecary digestional discomfort when overused, as did mine. 

We also don't give him any meat, but that's a personal choice. Babies get what they need from breastmilk, formula and iron-fortified cereals and besides, the first time you change a diaper that has... um, "processed meat baby food" in it, you'll understand why. :-)

<td>how to make a 1 year kid sleep all the night?</td>
<td>This does require some in depth analysis. I will however point out things you need to ensure that he gets a good night rest:

1. Make sure that the baby eats well, is not sleeping on an empty stomach that will definitely wake'em up during the night.

2. Ensure that the baby is not wet, the pamper does not leak or the baby is not going to bed wearing wet clothes. Washing and giving a bath to the baby can also help him go to sleep.

3. Also make sure that the bed he is sleeping is comfortable, it is not lumpy, does not have obstructiona and obtrusions to hamper an enlengthened sleep cycle.

4. Furthermore, look for physical problems like a blocked nose, something in the diet that causes stomach aches and the likes.

5. Let the baby sleep whenever he wants specially during the daytime, but when he is up keep him busy so that by the time he hits the sack he is dog tired.

6. Do not let the baby cry too much that also induces weakness and causes the chest to ache.

There is no reason to worry, as my doctor told me when my first baby girl was born, they are humans like us and now they are in this world -everything will happen they will get sick, angry, cold, etc., and when you see a tail coming or horns developing then you should get worried.

<td>How do I get my 11 month old baby to sleep through the night?</td>
<td>My baby girl slept through the night for the first time just last night. She is almost seven months. We've been slowly working at it for over a month. Be sure to have a CONSISTANT bedtime ritual. I cannot stress this enough. We have bathtime, lotion massage, maybe a story depending on how tired she is, nurse her, and then stand up with her in the nursing position but with a pacifier in her mouth for a couple of minutes but don't let her fall asleep and then put her in her crib. I say "time to go to sleep, I love you" and walk out of the room. 

This is the critical part.She will almost always start crying. I let her cry for 5 min, then go back and tell her I'm near, put her pacifier back in (this will be the next habit to tackle so if you aren't using a pacifier just ignore this), maybe touch her belly but do not pick her up, and then walk out of the room again. She'll probably be crying still but don't go back in there for ten more minutes. Keep extending the time period by five minutes. She'll feel safe and know that you are near and eventually fall asleep. You have to do this every time she wakes up in the middle of the night so it's usually best to start on a friday night or you'll have a very tired week. If the dad is able to have him help as much as possible because your baby can sense you and wants you to pick him/her up.

The reason it took us over a month is because I was only increase the minutes by like 2-3 in between going in there so I'd go in there at 5 min, 7 more min, 10 min after that, 13... but it works! For my friends (I live on a military base.. lots of friends with babies), who actually wait the full 5 minute incraments say it only takes about 3-4 nights to work! CRAZY! GOOD LUCK!</td>

<td>My daughter develops a nappy rash?</td>
<td>Diaper (nappy) rash is caused because the skin is irritated by coming in contact with urine and/or feces.  Babies in cultures that don't use diapers don't have diaper rash.

There are many things you can try to alleviate the rash.  Check her diaper frequently and change it as soon as it is wet or poopy.  Apply diaper rash cream with zinc oxide.  Wash the affected area gently with warm soapy water and blow dry with a hair dryer on low heat.  You may wish to try changing from disposable to cloth diapers or vice versa (some babies react badly to the chemicals in disposable diapers, others do better in disposables because they are more absorbent).  If you use cloth diapers, try changing the detergent you use to wash the diapers, and try different additives (no bleach, no fabric softeners, but try baking soda in the wash or vinegar or tea tree oil in the rinse).  Try using baby washcloths and warm water instead of disposable wipes at diaper changes, and dry thoroughly before putting a clean diaper on.  Allow your daughter time with a bare bottom as often as possible.

You may also wish to begin the practice of elimination communication.  It's a gentle method traditionally practiced by many Asian and African cultures that can reduce diaper use, improve diaper rash, increase baby-parent bonding, and it usually leads to earlier toilet training than the norm in Western society.  The DiaperFreeBaby organization can provide you with free support if you're interested.</td>

Then you only have to enter the date of your cousin's birth. All babies born on that day will appear with their first name and last initial. Good luck!</td>

I switched him into the Wal-Mart brand Parent's Choice ones, and they are working better than the Pampers in my opinion (they have no fragrance at all which is a big bonus to me) I've also been using Johnson and Johnson's Medicated baby powder at every change and that has cleared it up almost completely. (It's got the same active ingredient as Balmex and Desitin, but in a LOT less messy form) Hope this helps ;)</td>

God will make sure she has what she needs if she asks for it in sincerity. I had to use a dresser drawer padded with blankets as a crib for my first daughter and yes I did have a baby shower.  I received a lot of things just not the big things that I thought I would get.  Eventually, God allowed me to have everything I needed to raise my daughter. All I had to do was ask.  Let her know, she needs to be humble. She is very blessed to have friends like you.</td>

Make the oatmeal with a "runny" consistency, so that when it cools to baby temperature it doesn't coagulate and become a choking hazard.  You'll have to give him small bites and watch him carefully to make sure he doesn't gag.  Oatmeal is a pretty big step for an 8 month old, but if he's handling other table foods well I'd give it a try.</td>

You can also try your local baby stores. I looked online and it looks like Wal-Mart and Target don't carry Kushies.

Until you get the covers, stick your hand between the diaper and your daughter's skin when you are fastening the pin. That way you won't stick her.</td>

I even had her in the same bed as Her dad and myself.. but she would scream, cry, and had sooo much fear in her eyes everytime we went to bed, it got to the point that I had to sleep on the couch with her.. We tried everything.. nothing worked.. We ended up moving because I refused to let my daughter be that terrified in her own home.. she's fine now, even sleeps in her own bedroom.. (she's 3 now). Children are more succeptable to seeing ghosts, or atleast they have a far more vivid imagination than we adults.. My husband is the same way though.. I've never seen anything or heard anything, but while I was pregnant with my daughter, my husband and I were living in a house that was spooky, even to me.. He would wake up fighting with things in the bed with us.. He saw an old woman sitting in my rocking chair in the living room on numerous occasions.. I believe my husband. I saw his eyes when he woke up fighting with something in the bed (he woke me up by throwing me out of the bed to protect me), It was fear, a fear I had never seen in his eyes before. He's a large man and it was throwing him up against the headboard. I believe my daughter has gotten that gift (or curse) from him.. maybe your daughters the same way..

"Most babies have some jaundice during the first week of life. The ordeal of birth can send many red blood cells to an early retirement (especially if a vacuum is used!), and babies’ livers are often unprepared for the load. Before Mom’s milk comes in and stooling begins in earnest, bilirubin accumulates more easily. Jaundice is even more common in premature babies."</td>

<td>I have 2 daughters and both suffered with colic. The first was allergic to cow's milk and after being placed on soy formula did very well. The second one had very severe colic. She would cry 20 out of 24 hours each day. An old wives trick is to make a tea from fennel seeds. You can add a tiny bit of clear Karo syrup to sweeten it. The Karo syrup also helps to beak up gas. Try holding the baby in the colic position. You take the baby, place it stomach down on your arm and snuggle it close to your body. Some pediatricians recommend Mylicon drops. There are also some very strong prescription medications that can be used on a very limited basis for babies with severe colic. Talk to your baby's doctor (if you haven't already). A sympathetic doctor really helps. Although you might find it difficult, you need to get a break from that screaming bundle of joy periodically. Either you go out of the house or have someone take the baby out for an hour and you take a nice long bubble bath! Hope this helps! I know what you are going through!!!</td>

<td>how do you know your baby's getting educated fully?</td>
<td>Since I am faced with the problem for the first time, I can't claim to be an authority or anything... But here goes.

First of all, there is no such thing as 'education' in the usual sense as far as babies go. We are talking 7-month-old so it is probably just picking up the basic skills.

Give your baby a 'rich environment' so it can absorb stimulae as much as possible.

For example, visual stimulation at an early age is known to enhance its visual perception. Just don't force it to look at anything in particular. Throw everything you have at it and it will just pick it up. Make sure there are lots and lots of colors. Also, many shades (dark, ligh, contrast, etc). Colorful wallpapers, toys and anything that can be used to furnish its environment is good enough.

The same goes for audio stimulation. Lots of tunes. As for language, exposing the child to many languages will enhance its ability to pick up new languages later. I come from a bilingual family, so I speak two languages fluently without any formal 'education'. Of course, if you can't speak more than one language yourself, you won't be able to teach your kid more than one, so the ability to pick up languages will be lost at some time if it is unused. It is certainly an advantage, though, if you offer (I say offer, not enforce) formal education at some point. It is probably a good idea to make sure you don't play things that upset a child. The same goes for tone of the languages you let it hear. If it cannot handle it, stop it.

Let the child explore as much as it likes, and if you think something is dangerous, just hide it away. Don't blame the child for breaking something: it's your fault if you fail to hide it good enough. Yelling at the child will come back to haunt it later in life (we call it 'lack of curiosity' and such children are sometimes labeled as 'lacking interest and/or courage')... in other words, don't feed it your own fears and inhibitions. For example, I hate bugs. I can't even squish one with newspaper. But my wife has no probs with that. So she will be the 'bug man' (well, 'bug woman', to be precise) around the house. All bug contact will be handled by her, so my baby girl will learn about bugs from her (and tell her friends her father is a little crybaby :).

(I guess the following bit will be useful a bit later, when the child learns to speak. but it's a good way of thinking and I guess it's never too late to practice it a bit in advance. Besides, the children may not uderstand you, but I'm pretty sure *they can feel it* when you directly or indirectly aprove of their activity.) 

If it does something you don't like, just say that it is something *you* don't like (yes, I said 'like' not 'approve'), not something she/he shouldn't do. Every one of us did something that we were not allowed as kids. So, I think it's fair enough to tell the kid that we just don't like it, rather than "don't you ever do it again" or something harsh like that. If you can't go against yourself on this one (many people can't) then 'hire' someone who will 'do the job' for you. Or  tell it a story that treats the subject, but doesn't expose you (fairytales are excellent for that). Of course, I don't think this approach will always work (actually, I don't know), so use your best judgment. 

That's about it. Hope this helps...</td>

I have a 7 month old as well - and from what I read - current thoughts and according to JAMA is that formula/breastmilk should be their primary source of food for their first year.  My friend called her pediatrician and she told her a minimum of formula for her baby to eat per day so she's cutting back on some of the solids even though it's been tough for her to get her son to drink more - cutting back is helping him eat more formula.

I'd call your pediatrician and find out what he/she feels is an acceptable minimum and find out whether your little one is meeting that.

Sleeping with you is safe and okay as long as there are no smokers, it's not a waterbed, nodrug use, etc. 

She's no fool, she knows where the best sleeping is! 

Crying it out is harmful, it releases stress hormones in her body that are damaging. 

The book will help you figure out ways to help her get to sleep without trauma, and find ways to make bedtime work for the whole family. Good luck!</td>

Usually doctors tell you to wait until your 6-week checkup. This is a good guideline because by that point most women are ready and the doctor has had the opportunity to check that everything is back to normal.

If you are interested in birth control, let the doctor know so that he can prescribe something that is appropriate (depends whether you are breastfeeding or not &amp; other factors).

If you are planning another pregnancy soon, make sure to take extra good care of yourself and to start the pregnancy off on the right foot by taking folic acid 3 months in advance and making sure that your hemoglobin is high enough.</td>

Can be be done without pain? yes.
A few things to remember.
1) There are no proven benefts or detriments either way. Its a matter of choice or religion. MANY studies have shown that statistically there is no benefit.
2) If done with topical anesthesia followed by tylenol, it does not increase levels of stress or trigger infant indicators of pain and distress. If done in the first week of life, the infact brain is unable to process it, remember it, and if anesthetic is used, even feel it. Again, proven.
3)If done without anesthetic it will hurt. They will register distress for the duration of the procedure and 30 seconds after, but then return to normal. Brain imaging scans prove this. At no point during the procedure did a region of the brain associated with pain register the procedure.

Draw your own conclusion.  Do we see millions of men suffering life long agony from this procedure? Does anyone remember it? What we know of the human brain and development has shown us that with proper technique the surgery is notharmful to infants.</td>

You should bathe him every day. It keeps his little body clean and smelling good. Start at the top and work your way down his little body, massage him and turn him, make him move and laugh. This really is why you do it at night. He'll be totally exhausted and more than ready for bed.

Use some Johnson's baby powder and Johnson's body lotion all over him. It will not dry out his skin to bathe every day.  He would thank you if he could.</td>

<td>Why are some parents so afraid of holding their babies?</td>
<td>Carrying babies around in carriers and strollers is for protection, for both parent and child, and, for convienence - one cannot hold a child at all times - it is not practical, nor is it possible. - It is also not good for the parent to ask "how high" everytime the child says "jump".  In other words, from day one, children are taking notes for what "works" for them, and what doesn't.  By the time they are two (2 yrs), too high of a percentage of children these days, are spoiled rotten, and in charge of the parents - as opposed to the other way around as nature intended.  All conditioning, good and bad, starts almost immediately after birth.  This is a societal crisis, indeed it is becoming a cultural crisis we are facing in this country - and it seems to be getting worse.  

I understand what you mean - and where you are coming from, it is VERY difficult to hear the crying and know that this is your own flesh, blood and bone that is crying out - it is perfectly natural - the most natural thing in the world. But as long as the child IS being held, and otherwise loved, on a daily basis - it is best not to give in to their every whim and desire - they're kids, they are naturally going to try to manipulate, they do not know what is best for them.  A responsible parent does.</td>

<td>how do u get a baby off to sleep???, my son is 8 months old?</td>
<td>Try a bedtime routine, gradually winding down as you get closer to his sleep time.

For example after playing a little bit, you can have dinner and then a bath, then read a book or a massage. You can also nurse him (but not to sleep).
Then you can turn out the light, say good night to everything. You can then rock him and when you hear a yawn or when you feel he is about to fall asleep, put him in his bed (he should fall asleep in his bed). You can then rub his back, hum a song..

The key is to keep the routine simple a consistent. Especially when you start. After it's okay you skip some part of it..The baby has learned that night time is coming and will be more willing to go to sleep.

You can also use white noise..or a little lovey (his favorite blanket,a teddy bear...), so that he is not affraid when you leave the room.</td>

My husband is in Iraq, and has been since july of last year, so I know it's hard.. espically with limited help. But you'll catch on, and if you play your cards right, you'll be able to have them both take a nap at the same time.. so you'll get about 30 mins.. (tops) to yourself a day... I suggest, and this keeps me sain, get into the habit of just before you older child's nap, feed the younger one and when your older child lays down, lay down with your younger one, and take a nap yourself.. you'll need it... Another wonderful invention is baby einstin, or curious buddies.. Stick the older child in a playpen, or a chair and put in the wonderful dvd while your feeding the younger one, and when the youngest drifts to sleep, as they do after thier tummies are full, play a game with you older child.. or my personal fav, tickle them into submission! The only problem with that is the songs get stuck in your head, and you'll find yourself singing them at random times, like in the produce section of the gorcery store.. then people look at you funny... Just remember that you're not super mommy, and when someone offers to watch one of the babies, let them! take one day at a time, and make sure that you plan to leave about an hour before you are supposed to for appointments, becasue no matter what, you'll always be late..Good Luck!</td>

After a few times of this,ask him if he wants to get in with you.
Or you may have to start over and use the sink first. ALWAYS reassure your child you will always be there. No matter what.</td>

<td>Can someone suggest cute name for a baby girl?</td>
<td>Rather than giving you a long list of names, I'll share with you my criteria on choosing names. 1) The doctor/president test: would you trust your life (or give your vote) to a woman named Mykensi? Probably not. How about Elizabeth? That would be more likely, yes? 2) The elderly test: how is this name going to sound on your sweet little girl when she's a mature, older woman? Do you think she'd be the least bit embarassed to be known to everyone as Kandi Star? Nuh-uh.

Just be reasonable. Pick a name that will grow well with your child - and if the name has a meaning that you love, or is after a family member that you'd like to honor, so much the better. For what it's worth, my daughter's name is Rachael ("little lamb") Anna (named for my grandmother.)

Both of my kids started eating solid foods at the appropriate ages and drink cow's milk.  I do not nurse my kids in public because I understand it is uncomfortable for others to see.  I do choose not to force my kids to wean off because I see how stressful it is to them to take it away and as long as I am here and available I will continue.  It is still beneficial for them unlike the answer that said it is not after three months.  Here is a link to an article about the benefits of breastfeeding a toddler:

<td>when should parents introduce a baby stroller or a baby carriers after the baby is born?</td>
<td>Strollers can be used as soon as your pediatrician gives the OK for your baby to go outside, but the stroller must have a full recline position to lay the baby flat. Another option is a travel system, where you can keep your baby in his/her infant car seat plugged into the matching stroller. Travel systems are most commonly sold together as a pair.

Carriers can be used immediately as well, as long as you get one that has an infant head support. McLaren makes one that's great and you can take the infant support out when your baby can hold his/her head up. And, no, they don't affect leg shape. Babies are naturally bow-legged for most of the first year.</td>

<td>Will my breast milk clear up my baby's eye mucus?</td>

My girl had some eye boogers in her left eye when she was about 1 month old...  green gunk would appear and hold her eye half closed.  We treated it with a couple drops of breastmilk at the end of each feeding, and it cleared up after a day or two.  It works because it's loaded with antibodies...  it's not just food, it's a jumpstart for your baby's immune system.  

Now, you don't want to LEAVE it on her, cause like any milk it will go sour eventually.  Just wipe her off with a clean damp cloth when you're done.  

Oh, and here's another angle:  even if you don't believe that it works as a topical ointment, you can assume it's safe.  Your own experience, and any mother can tell you there are occasions when baby gets milk all over her face (it happens).  It's not harmful, it's just messy.  So don't be afraid to try it.</td>

<td>If your child watches with interest when you wat, can sit upright and is at least 4 to 6 months old, you should be safe feeding more solids. Your pediatrician knows best of course.

It is best to avoid mixin cereal in bottles, as it tends to clog up and is not neccessary. You can make a very runny cereal that works fine.  There is no problem mixing baby food with cereal, as long as the cereal was FIRST mixed with water or formula. You want to make sure the cereal provides extra water and not takes it away, causing constipation.
You can add mashed up banana to cereal to improve the taste. Or mix it with formula instead of water.

All of these help boost the caloric content and improve taste.</td>

<td>When did you start giving other liquids to your baby?  What were they, and what did you use?  (sippy cup...)?</td>
<td>The best liquid that you can give your baby is water. Most juices (except those marked 100% fruit juice) usually have too much sugar in them. And let's face it: at 11 months, would you rather have a cup of something that tastes sweet or something with no taste at all? Starting a healthy realtionship with water now will make it easier for her to drink water when she's older and needs to rehydrate after a long day of playing in the summer heat. Juice should be given sparingly to avoid an unshakable attachment. And as a rule, sodas and caffeinated drinks should not be introduced at all while her baby teeth are coming in. These cause tooth decay and caffeine can cause hyper-activity. 

Also,make sure that you use more than one sippy cup to avoid a "favorite sippy" scenario, in which baby uses the same sippy day in and day out. Neglecting to wash sippy can help bacteria breed on her cup. You might also want to limit sippy use to meal and snack times at first to keep her from getting full from liquids.</td>

<td>What are the changes in the baby 0-6 months?</td>
<td>Infants cannot be "spoiled" if they are held too much. Babies need constant, loving and tender touches to build self-confidence, trust and communication. Loving touches like holding, cradling, hugs, kisses and gentle tickles are important to a baby’s development.


Talk to your baby a lot. Talk in complete sentences – even as you carry out your daily routine. Tell him about the weather or what you’re doing at the moment. Talk and describe things to him as you get dressed, drive or go shopping. When you talk, he learns the rhythms of language and words and the sound of your voice.


It’s never too early to begin reading to your baby. Starting when she is a newborn, make reading an everyday experience. Read simple children’s stories or make up a story as you look at a picture book. If you are reading a book or newspaper, read it aloud so your baby can begin to hear the rhythm and pattern of language.


A baby’s vision is the first thing to develop. Give her lots of things to look at. Safely hang things above her crib such as paper plates - draw black and white patterns as well primary colors like red, yellow and blue on the plates. Hold an object 10 to 12 inches from her face and slowly move it back and forth. As she tries to follow your movement, she will build eye coordination and neck muscles.


Every time you change a diaper, sing a song or talk to baby. Gently tickle his tummy and feet, make bike-riding motions with his legs. Make eye contact and recite nursery rhymes or make up silly songs. Make the most of diaper changing – your baby is a captive audience!


Make sure your baby has "noisy" toys so she can hear different sounds. Make a rattle by putting a few beans in a tightly sealed plastic container. Securely sew small bells to her socks, booties or shoes. Always stay close and play with your baby when she uses toys to make sure she doesn’t remove or swallow small parts.


Play "Peek-a-Boo" and "This Little Piggy" for as long as your baby laughs and enjoys the games. When he turns his head away, he’s had enough for now. Give him time to rest before the next play. For "This Little Piggy," gently wiggle each toe, starting with the big toe, as you say each line of the rhyme: "This little piggy went to market; this little piggy stayed home; this little piggy had roast beef; this little piggy had none; and this little piggy cried ‘wee, wee, wee’ all the way home!"


Make sounds that your baby can imitate. Repeat them and encourage her to make the sounds like you do.


Use bath time for learning fun. For small babies, float brightly colored sponges in the water. Cut new new household sponges in the shape of fish. Make up silly songs about the bath tub fish.


When taking baby outside for a walk, talk about what you see. Describe the green grass, sounds of birds, texture of bark and everything you can see, hear, touch or smell. 


Smile at your baby as much as you can. Smiling at him will teach him to smile in return and sends a positive, approving message. Approval can also come from gentle hugs and pats.


When your baby makes noises at you, treat them as conversation. Talk back. Your response will help teach your baby how to relate to other people and starts to teach the basics of conversation.


Repeat, repeat and repeat again. Repetition helps all babies and toddlers form a strong foundation for learning and good behavior. Don’t feel you always have to have a new story, new song or new activity. Children learn from repeated experiences.


Help your baby learn from gently experiencing different textures and temperatures. Guide baby’s hand to feel a soft, furry plush toy; hard, smooth plastic; cold ice; warm toast or rough carpet. It’s important to describe what baby is feeling as she touches. Be careful that textures or temperatures are clean and safe and won’t hurt little hands.

Look at the time if day and try to plan according to that.  Try for an afternoon if you do not want to feed everone a meal.  Then you can just to cake and punch.  Whatever you do, have fun and take lots of pictures.</td>

<td>expecting triplet boys SOON where can we get discounts coupons samples and freebies for these little guys ?</td>
<td>If you live in a larger area, look for a coupon exchange. THere are people who trade or give away coupons that they don't use but receive anyway, like from companies or grocery stores. Shop for sales on diapers; surprisingly grocery stores can have better prices than say wal-mart. And take a calculator to the store when you're shopping. The bigger packages are NOT always a better deal, especially when it comes to diapers. divide price by number of diapers and use the coupon on the best deal you can get. If you have to get smaller packages to save money, I reccommend stocking up because you will go through them VERY quickly (though I think that will become obvious). Also, feel free to ask for as many samples as the hospital is willing to give you when you come home. Usually they'll give you anything from diapers to bottle nipples to baby wipes, shampoos, even formulas (though if you can nurse them even for a little bit or combined with formulas more power to you, it's so good for them). Sign up with different formula companies for their free samples, they send a LOT in the first few months and before baby is born. I think some of them have home delivery options available that might be an even better value.

There are also lots of free magazines that you won't find time to read but can come with coupons.

Best advice, take the help that is offered. If a family member walks in and starts washing your dishes, let them! Don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it, even if it's just for somebody to watch the babies while you take a shower or bath! You need your sanity to take care of just one baby, I sincerely feel for you with three! Congratulations!!!</td>

All babies are different. Two of mine spit up a lot and two of them didn't. If you are really worried about it, even after talking to your doctor listen to your gut. You know your baby best. Get a second opion. They have reflux medicines for babies if the spitting up is a problem. 

I say this because my nephew, now 9, was just diagnosed with reflux. He spit up and vommitted a lot as an infant and little guy and he's had a lot of stomach pains and problems with milk. All this time he has suffered from this when a little medicine would have helped him so easily.</td>

<td>It is normal for little children to cry when going to a daycare center.  You need to go early enough where he can feel comfortable that this is a new place that he will love and that Mommy or Daddy is nearby.

Don't run out when he is distracted but tell him you are going to work and that you will be back later to pick him up. Keep on that smile...they read your fears too! Give him a favorite familiar toy to keep with him as a comfort.  

It is hard on parents and children alike.  Just keep reassuring him everyday that he is there to have fun with all the other children and he will get use to the new routine and should be fine. When he sees you coming to pick him up everyday he won't worry as much and you can eventually leave him at the door.</td>

She has no right to demand a "boyfriend" be called anything by your child or even to demand that your child have a relationship with someone of whom you do not approve or do not like.  It is YOUR child...not hers, and your judgement is best.  Just refer to him as "Mr. _______" in front of the baby.  That's who he is.  If your mother doesn't like it, tough.  She needs to respect that YOU call the shots where your kid is concerned.  Trust your mothering instincts, and don't let your mother bully you into something with which you are not comfortable for your child.  She's is not thinking about the child, but about her feelings and that of the boyfriend, and that is not right.  In time, maybe you'll feel differently about this man, but it's entirely likely that he'll be gone before you know it and will be replaced by the next "grandpa".  That's not fair to your kid.  When my brother was engaged, his fiance was referred to as "Miss ______" until AFTER the wedding.  Then she became "Aunt _____".</td>

The length of time you knew your boyfriend doesn't matter now, and whether or not it's "too soon" is also somewhat of a moot point.  

I am glad you told your mom.  Just think a lot about what you want to do.  Abortion is a hard choice and it will haunt you forever.  Adoption is a great way to help give parents who can't have children a chance.  Keeping the baby will cause you to change your whole way of living- but worth it as long as you don't blame the baby.  You have to grow up, right now. Make sure you are taking a prenatal vitamin and eating right, also see a Dr.- take care of yourself.

Follow your heart and know that every option you have will be difficult AND you can do what you feel is right.  Hopefully you have your parents support to make it easier.  Your life isn't over, just different and it will take a lot more effort now to reach your goals but you can do it.

<td>Preemies and breastfeeding?</td>
<td>While I haven't had a preterm baby, I have been involved with a breastfeeding group for some time now and have seen many preemies breastfeeding.  Your breastmilk will come in, probably 2-5 days after delivery (which is considered normal for any pregnancy -- I've never heard of milk coming in before delivery -- that's kind of cool).  Very cool thing about it, is that your body will actually keep the levels of fats and immunological agents higher in your milk than if you deliver full term.  Your body will respond to the length of time you were pregnant to determine the type of milk baby needs.  Neat, huh?  You should, however, expect many more difficulties nursing than with your first three.  A 34/35 week baby tends to have some trouble with latching and will be very sleepy.  You may have to pump and use some sort of device for feeding.  You should meet with a lactation consultant prior to your induction, if possible, or as soon after birth as is possible.  Talk with her about SNS (supplemental nursing system) and finger feeders as methods to supply extra breastmilk (or formula if needed).  Also, be sure that all the nurses know you are committed to breastfeeding.  Most hospitals are getting a lot better about this, but we still need to be fairly vigilant.  Until breastfeeding is well established (which may take until 3-4 weeks after your due date, but could be sooner),  avoid using a pacifier.  Preemies are more likely to experience nipple confusion.  The website I referenced is a great place for all things breastfeeding related. Good luck with your new baby!</td>

<td>what is the best recipe for diaper rash ointment?</td>
<td>I have never made my own but here are some suggestions.  http://www.otan.dni.us/webfarm/emailproject/diaper.htm

- OR- 

1 teaspoon (about .02 ounces) anhydrous lanolin
1/2 ounce sweet almond oil
1 ounce extra virgin olive oil
1/4 ounce (approx. .03 ounces) beeswax
6 drops Fairy Whispers Aromatherapy Blend 

Combine all ingredients except the Fairy Whispers Aromatherapy Blend in a Pyrex measuring cup with a pour spout. Place the cup of ingredients in a hot water bath until the wax is nearly melted.

Once the wax is nearly melted, remove the cup from the water bath and stir with a clean utensil (like a pop sickle stick or small spoon) to ensure an even mixture. Add the Fairy Whispers Aromatherapy Blend and stir again.

Pour into jars, scraping the sides of the measuring cup well to remove as much of the product as possible. Allow to cool before capping. Store at comfortable room temperature and be sure to dip only clean fingers in the product to help protect shelf life.

Fairy Whispers Aromatherapy Blend is a combination of lavender, neroli and Roman chamomile essential oils in these proportions: 80 drops lavender essential oil, 10 drops neroli essential oil and 6 drops Roman chamomile oil. This recipe makes about 1/16 ounce of the blend. Combine the drops of oil in a bottle and shake gently to mix. For best results, allow to stand a few days before using. Fairy Whispers Aromatherapy Blend can also be used as a diffuser blend in the nursery.

<td>should baby boys be circumcised?</td>
<td>I think its more of a preference then a need.  Or it may be done for religious reasons..

Heres some information:

Studies about the benefits of circumcision have provided conflicting results. Some studies show certain benefits, while other studies do not. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says the benefits of circumcision are not significant enough to recommend circumcision as a routine procedure and that circumcision is not medically necessary. The American Academy of Family Physicians believes parents should discuss with their son's doctor the potential benefits and the risks involved when making their decision.

A recent AAP report stated that circumcision does offer some benefit in preventing urinary tract infections in infants. Circumcision also offers some benefit in preventing penile cancer in adult men. However, this disease is very rare in all men, whether or not they have been circumcised. Circumcision may reduce the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. A man's sexual practices (e.g., if he uses condoms, if he has more than one partner, etc.) has more to do with STD prevention than whether or not he is circumcised.

Study results are mixed about whether circumcision may help reduce the risk of cervical cancer in female sex partners, and whether it helps prevent certain problems with the penis, such as infections and unwanted swelling. Some studies show that keeping the penis clean can help prevent these problems just as well as circumcision. Infections and unwanted swelling are not serious and can usually be easily treated if they do occur.

What are the risks of circumcision?
Like any surgical procedure, circumcision has some risks. However, the rate of problems after circumcision is low. Bleeding and infection in the circumcised area are the most common problems. Sometimes the skin of the newly exposed glans becomes irritated by the pressure of diapers and ammonia in the urine. The irritation is usually treated with petroleum ointment (Vaseline) put directly on the area. This problem will usually lessen after a few days.</td>

My son had a mild form and his surgeon told us that it was up to us whether we wanted him left with a circumsized or uncircumsized appearence. We chose a circumsized appearence but if you want your son uncircumsized then just make sure you let the surgeon know beforehand. 
You don't have anything to worry about (although I know it's hard not to, I was the same!) They will give him a mild epidural and the surgery should take about an hour. My son was in no pain when he woke up. He was even walking up and down his cot in the hospital about 10 minutes after he woke to the surprise of the nurses! He had minimal pain during his recovery, in fact after the first day he didn't even require baby panadol and the only time he cried in pain at all was approximately 3 days after the surgery and only then when his nappy was being changed, this only lasted for 2 or 3 days. Just make sure that you apply a lot of nappy cream or vaseline after each nappy change to protect the area. There will be a LOT of swelling for the first few days, this is nothing to worry about! (I say that because I was a bit freaked out by it and worried that something was wrong) The swelling should disappear completely in around 2 weeks but now (a month after surgery) he is 100% recovered and you'd never be able to tell that there had been a problem, he looks just like any other little boy down there.</td>

You can even call your local hospital &amp; ask to speak to the on call OBGYN or someone who can answer questions if its after hrs at your pediactrics office. I did this several times during my baby's first few wks &amp; they were glad to help. Several pediatricians told me babies that young must eat every 2 hrs. &amp; Even if they're sleeping you definately shouldn't let them go more than 4hrs without eating at this phase in their development. After you try all this: In my experience it seems Babies think they're hungry when really they have a need to suck. It's naturally relaxing to them. I fed my baby every 1.5 hrs only to finally realize this &amp; he would go right back to sleep with something to suck on. So try a passifier if he still seems hungry when you know he's had enough. If they spit up a lot it's also a sign they've had to much or didn't burp good &amp; the gas pushed it out. You'll get the hang of whats what. Not to mention sometimes the mixing of two milks upset their little stomachs &amp; the discomfort is confused with hunger. Make sure you burp baby good. The best way is burp him every ounce. A good burp is sometimes all they need! Good luck! Being a new Mom is wonderful but not always easy!</td>

<td>yikes... my teething baby is rocking with his daddy right now while I escape to cyberspace... teething tablets can be good, if baby will let you give them. Give baby a toothbrush to chew on, the bristles can stimulate and the handle is fun to get those back teeth with, just watch him/her to guard against choking. Also introduces baby to the toothbrush early, my son won't let me take it away from him sometimes!!

There are finger toothbrushes that you can put on your finger and let baby chew on while you massage the gums. Protects your fingers.

Good luck, I'm gonna go try to nurse mine to sleep.</td>

<td>What would cause small acne-like bumps on a newborn's face?</td>
<td>Baby acne is common.

To many parents' dismay, their beautiful newborn's face breaks out with red bumps. This is called baby acne. It tends to occur at about the same age as the baby's peak gas production and fussiness. How attractive! (This all coincides with parents' maximum sleep deprivation.) Parents are often quite concerned both about how these bumps look and about their significance.

These bumps, Beckie, are quickly fleeting evidence of the connection between your body and your son's. During the final moments of your pregnancy, your hormones crossed the placenta into your son. Among other things (such as maturing his lungs), this stimulated the oil glands on your son's skin, eventually giving rise to the baby acne.

Fleshy or red pimples can be present at birth, but typically appear at 3 to 4 weeks of age. They occur predominately on the cheeks, but are also quite common on the forehead and chin. Whiteheads are sometimes present. This condition tends to come and go until the baby is between 4 and 6 months old.

The acne will be most prominent when your son is hot or fussy (increased blood flow to the skin), or when his skin is irritated. If his skin comes into contact with cloth laundered in harsh detergents, or becomes wet from saliva or milk that he has spit up, the condition may appear worse for several days.

Gently cleanse his face once a day with water, and perhaps a mild baby soap. Oils and lotions do not help, and may aggravate the condition. If the acne is severe or lasts beyond 6 months, your pediatrician may prescribe a mild medicine to help.

Otherwise, you can expect that the rash will soon be a memory. The oil glands will disappear, and you won't see the acne again until you turn around once, and he's a teenager. This time the acne will be evidence that his own hormones are turning him into a man.</td>

<td>how is a babies dna really determined?</td>
<td>The egg from the mother has 23 chromosomes, the sprem from the father has 23 chromosomes.  When they join together in fertilization, the two sets come together.  They make the 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) found in humans.  So you are half your mother and half your father. However, when joined, they go through a process called genetic recombination.  Some of the genes on the chromosomes can move or switch places, creating different combinations.  This is one of the reasons why every person born is different.

The gender of the baby is determined by the father however. The 23rd chromosome in humans determines their sex. All females have the pair, XX so when their body creates eggs, they all contain an X chromosome.  Males, however, have XY.  So when their bodies create sperm, they can have either X or Y.  When an egg and sperm meet, the egg will always provide an X, while the sperm may provide either an X or Y, determining the gender of the fetus.</td>

<td>How does Finugreek help with milk production?</td>
<td>Fenugreek, also called methi, is a crop plant grown as a potherb and for the spice made from its seeds. The fenugreek plant grows wild from the eastern Mediterranean area to China; it is cultivated worldwide.

The name fenugreek or foenum-graecum is from Latin for "Greek hay".

Fenugreek is used both as a herb (the leaves) and a spice (the seed). The yellow, rhombic fenugreek seed is frequently used in the preparation of pickles, curry powders and pastes, and is often encountered in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent and Thailand. The young leaves and sprouts of fenugreek are eaten as greens and the fresh or dried leaves are used to flavor other dishes. In the Arabian nation of Yemen it is the main condiment and an ingredient added to the national dish called Saltah. The similarity in the Arabic word Hulba and Mandarin Chinese word Hu lu ba reveal the significance of fenugreek in history. Fenugreek is also one of four herbs used for the Iranian recipe Ghormeh Sabzi.

A side effect of consuming even small amounts of fenugreek is a maple syrup or curry smell in the eater's sweat and urine which is caused by the potent aroma compound sotolone. Fenugreek is frequently used in the production of flavoring for artificial syrups. The taste of toasted fenugreek is additionally based on substituted pyrazines, as is cumin. By itself, it has a somewhat bitter taste.

Fenugreek seed is widely used as a galactagogue (milk producing agent) by nursing mothers to increase inadequate breast milk supply. It can be found in capsule form in many health food stores.

In India it is mixed with yogurt and used as a conditioner for hair.</td>

<td>How do you tell your parents your pregnant?</td>
<td>First thing is to relax. Being pregnant is a blessing. When I became pregnant I was 27 and married to a man my parents did not care for. I was terrified about telling them. To my surprise, they were very accepting. I could feel their disappointment but I also couldn't ignore their joy. I worried myself sick for no reason. They were more understanding and supportive that I could have imagined. My advice is to tell them as soon as possible. My mom tells me she would have been devastated had she missed a moment of my pregnancy. My parents were a great help and my child has become their pride and joy and healed our family rift. Don't underestimate them. They may not always approve of the things you do but I am sure they will not fault you for blessing them with a grandchild.</td>

<td>How can I get my 8 month old to sleep thru the night?</td>
<td>You may want consider what sleeping through the night means to you and to an 8 months old baby..
Does it mean sleeping 8, 10 hours straight?
Only a small percentage of babies this age will sleep "through the night".
Most of them will wake up at least once..They will, because they are hungry, or too cold, too hot, they are teething.

The sleep cycle is light sleep followed by deep sleep period. At this age it still can take a long time before baby goes into deep sleep (maybe 30 minutes to an hour) then deep sleep may only last 1 or 2 hours.
Then gradually the baby will go into a light sleep cycle again..where they could easliy wake up..

Some babies will full awake, instead of staying into the light sleep period and going back into deep sleep again.

What is important is not how long they sleep, but their ability to fall BACK to sleep after they've waken up...

As already suggested you need to make sure they are not hungry when going to bed, that the room is not too cold, too hot...because otherwise, they will go all the up to waking, when the light sleep period kicks off, instead of going back into deep sleep.

When baby wakes up: you can rock her, rub her back, sing a song..Having music or white noise really help  too.
You can start the dishwasher while baby is asleep or even watch tv (not too loud)..It helps them know that you are still around..they can still hear familar sounds and be reassure when they are going back into that deep sleep period.

Hope this helps</td>

Things, however, change very quickly in a baby's life, so the fact that right now he screams doesn't mean that that will continue. 

I would try to encourage some positive experiences - bathing, feeding, cuddling. It might take him some time to calm down, but it's worth giving him a chance. I do think that a baby can recognize you at that age, but I don't think that he has a very long memory, so probably shortly after you leave the room, he will calm down.

If the baby is very attached to the kids, have them around too at the beginning - test for short periods of time, when you're nearby, but give it a chance!

Good luck!</td>

<td>What i s the best way to put a baby (3 month old) asleep?</td>
<td>Sounds like my little chunk! I nursed him to sleep, and he did go through a rather tiresome period of always waking up. If you just absolutely need a break, try laying down and getting the baby to sleep in the bed with you, but stay there and awake with a hand on him for reassurance. Read or just get some rest yourself. Some people worry about the baby in bed with you, SIDS and never getting him out of bed, set your own concern levels there or seek a medical opinion. I'm just sharing experience. You may want to try to extend the time between baby's naps and keep him more active while he's awake. He'll be more tired and in a deeper sleep if he's kept active during waking hours. You may want to try a rocking chair/rocking recliner to rock baby to sleep. The way you can tell if a baby is really asleep is to pick up his arm and gently drop it. If it flops down he's out. If he lowers it himself he's not ready to be put down. I think I read that in a magazine somewhere, but I also know from experience that it's true! I'm also finding that as they get older, putting them down sooner rather than later is key. If you put the baby down as soon as it's practical, they get to that later phase of sleep in the crib and stay there. When I hold my son too long after he drifts off, he wakes when I move and thinks he's done with his nap.

Good luck and when all else fails, shift sleeping may be the way to go! Driving is also a good way to get baby to sleep.</td>

<td>I am a young mother and I think i have the "milk feaver".What I have to do?</td>
<td>In the 18th century "milk fever" was a term commonly used to describe mastitis. Mastitis is an inflammation of the breast and can be infectious or non-infectious. Usually infectious mastitis has a sudden onset with noticeably sore breasts, generalized body aches and fever. Sometimes the breast is pink in the area of greatest congestion. Mastitis most commonly occurs in the first few weeks after the baby is born. It can be present in one or both breasts. 

The most important aspect in the treatment of mastitis is effective removal of milk from the breast. The best way to remove milk from the breast is with a baby who is breastfeeding effectively and comfortably with good position and latch. If you have mastitis I would encourage you to breastfeed as often as the baby will allow. Interrupting breastfeeding during a bout of mastitis would generally prolong your symptoms and greatly increase your risk of complications.

In addition to breastfeeding very frequently, you need to be evaluated by your physician to see if an antibiotic is needed. If this is necessary, the doctor can prescribe an antibiotic that is compatible with breastfeeding so you can continue to safely breastfeed your baby.</td>

Also, read stories.  This will develop the habit of reading early, and in a year or two, he will have the patience to sit through several books at a time.

Give him a warm bath, wrap him up in warmed towels, and then give him a complete body massage with warmed lotion.  Rub all over--his head, his hands, his feet.  You'll be expressing love, and developing his sense of touch, too.

Put him in a Snugli and keep him with you as you do housework, shopping, walking or whatever.  The closeness to you won't last long, but it is valuable now.

Did your friend have a lot of contact with the baby when a family member had her?

Did the other relative give her a list of the baby's favorite foods, what her schedule is? That is important to give her the same structure and consistency. Some of the crying could be because of the addition she was born with, these babies tend to cry a lot. I would be really concerned about her not eating, there could be a medical problem. That is why she needs to take her to a doctor. She also needs to get some information on what kind of problems a baby born addicted to crack can have so she will know what to expect and what to look for. The doctor may be able to help her with information or tell her where she can get information. I hope your friend has a reliable person to babysit so she can have a break from what appears to be a stressful situation. I wish your friend and the baby good luck.

Some spotting can be normal and nothing to worry about.  If you are concerned, you can call your nurse for advice. Or make an appointment to go in. They can do a blood test and based on your known LMP determine if the hormone levels are at the proper level for your gestation. If so, they can determine you are still pregnant. 

Some spotting is normal. It could be during the implantation process, especially if during the first 4 weeks. 

If the blood is dark red or has clots, then you should call your doctor. Or of it lasts more than a few days and is anything other than 'light'.

Therefore people whose genotype is OO are said to have type O blood, meaning the agglutinogen on their red blood cells doesn't have any enzymatic activity. People with Type O blood have agglutinins a and b in their blood plasma. Agglutinin a helps the body destroy any type A blood cells that might enter the circulation system. Agglutinin b helps the body destroy any type B blood cells that might enter the circulation system.</td>

<td>how can i make my 6 month old sleep thru the night?</td>
<td>My baby girl slept through the night for the first time just last night.  She is almost seven months.  We've been slowly working at it for over a month.  Be sure to have a CONSISTANT bedtime ritual.  I cannot stress this enough.  We have bathtime, lotion massage, maybe a story depending on how tired she is, nurse her, and then stand up with her in the nursing position but with a pacifier in her mouth for a couple of minutes but don't let her fall asleep and then put her in her crib.  I say "time to go to sleep, I love you" and walk out of the room.  

This is the critical part.She will almost always start crying.  I let her cry for 5 min, then go back and tell her I'm near, put her pacifier back in (this will be the next habit to tackle so if you aren't using a pacifier just ignore this), maybe touch her belly but do not pick her up, and then walk out of the room again.  She'll probably be crying still but don't go back in there for ten more minutes.  Keep extending the time period by five minutes.  She'll feel safe and know that you are near and eventually fall asleep.  You have to do this every time she wakes up in the middle of the night so it's usually best to start on a friday night or you'll have a very tired week.  If the dad is able to have him help as much as possible because your baby can sense you and wants you to pick him/her up.

The reason it took us over a month is because I was only increase the minutes by like 2-3 in between going in there so I'd go in there at 5 min, 7 more min, 10 min after that, 13...  but it works!  For my friends (I live on a military base.. lots of friends with babies), who actually wait the full 5 minute incraments say it only takes about 3-4 nights to work!  CRAZY!  GOOD LUCK!</td>

First thing is to make sure you don't have a clogged duct or infection. If that checks out, try nursing on the left side first every time. If that is too frustrating for your hungry little one, let your baby take the edge of his/her hunger on the right side, then switch to the left. Maybe also try pumping on that side.

I started out by mixing milk and formula and every week I would bump up the milk amount until it was nothing but milk. When you give it to them slowly, you will catch and allergies or anything like that early on and it will help the transfer.. Since you have already mixed his formula, I would go ahead and give him just milk and see how he handles it.</td>

Maybe there furstrated at something, they could be hungry, have a soiled diapper.
So you need to know why she's crying.

At 8 months old it is unlikely to be a colic or gas, unless she has some medical conditions..by this age their diggestive system has already matured.

After checking all her basic needs are met you can 
sooth her by rocking, going on car ride, or simpling rubbing her back.

She maybe screaming only because she wants your attention. You can maybe take her to her bedroom and spend some times in quiet place, reading a book, or singing songs..just some quiet activities.

Good luck</td>

The frequency will slow down as baby gets older, but even some toddlers and preschoolers still go several times a day. An increase in frequency of one-and-a-half or two times your child's normal pattern is considered abnormal.

Consistency: again, it's important to know what your child's stools usually look like. If the stools become looser, watery, mucusy, green, or runnier than usual, this is considered a significant change.</td>

Many babies will have gas - it doesn't mean lactose intolerance.  What you describe may also be colic.  Colic is very poorly understood, but it may be related to gas. Colic usually manifests around 1-2 months and resolves by 6-7 months.  There are no medications for colic.  The best treatment is swaddling and conforting your child.

You can try switching to a lactose free formula, such as isomil or prosobee, but you may not find it beneficial, espcecially if it's just colic.</td>

<td>Are cats dangerous to babies?</td>
<td>My husband and I got a kitten only 3 months before our son was born...adn we have never had a problem with him.  About a month before my son was born we started shutting the nursery door, so that the cat would realize that it was off limits.  After my son was born my husband took a blanket back to house...just like with a dog so that the cat would be able to smell the baby.  When I was nursing and my son slept in our bedroom the cat would be shut out of our bedroom.  During the day I would lay the baby down and leave the door open..my cat never tried to get into the bassinet.  The closest he ever got was laying on the bed looking in at him.  My baby is now 11 months old...and a terror! LOL  My cat won't really rough house with my husband or I; but he lets the baby pull fur, ears, paws, etc.  He did scratch him once...when the baby sat on him(which I didn't blame the cat for).  I hope that you make the best decision for you and your family.</td>

<td>No, an infant, no matter how much they are coached will walk when they are ready.  It is possible that working with them will build up their leg muscles a little faster, but basically it all comes down to balance, and there is nothing you can do to speed that up.  However, spending more time with your baby will jump start his emotional, social, and intellectual development, which will affect him/her for the rest of their life, and that is by far, way more important!!</td>

(For some reason yahoo answers isn't taking the link... go to: http://www.amazon.com and do a seach for Zippy Stroller Inglesina)

It's been rated the "best buy" for parents. It is functional, multi purpose, and you can fold it up with one hand. The best part is that it is only only 17 pounds. It can hold an infant seat and toddler. The models that you see that are a travel system comes with a stroller that is pretty heavy (the car seat/stroller ones). It even has a cup holder. It is also safe.

You can read reviews from the link above from people who bought it from www.amazon.com It comes in several different colors!</td>

<td>How old do babies start saying momma and dada?</td>
<td>Babies start *babbling* as early as three or four months, and may piece together syllables of ba, ma, da, pa, etc. So it's conceivable that they could *say" mama or dada very early. However, making the mental connection that this word (say, mama) is actually referring to this object or person (you), comes a bit later - usually at 8 months to 1 year.

My daughter was an early talker and began a few short words (duck, mama) discriminately at 8 months. Some children won't use words this way till well after one year - my friend's son refused to say mama until he was nearly two, and he's still well within the "normal" range for speech development.</td>

<td>How can I teach my 5 months old baby to sleep alone???</td>
<td>Most babies thrive on routine. Make sure the child is fed, burped, bathed,dry and clothed, then tuck them in by a certain time nightly. Most babies won't sleep through the night until they at least double their birth weight. So expect to still have to get up to feed them during the night. However, as long as the baby is comfortable, they should sleep in their own bed. Allowing them to cry it out will not harm them. Just make sure that you are not trying to tuck them in earlier than usual. A night light may or may not help, some babies like being able to look around the room while they are in bed. I do not recommend pillows, stuffed animals, or toys at such a young age, because they are suffocation and choking hazards. However, A small radio placed in the room, out of reach of baby may help.</td>

<td>How do I make my 3-month old settle at night?</td>

Bathtime with nice warm water, calming talk, I warmed the body wash and shampoo so that the whole experience was warm and soothing.  When baby was done washing, my husband would pull warmed towels out of the dryer, and we'd wrap baby up in soft, warm towels, and then do a complete body massage with warmed lotion.

Then, on with jammies, all the while with quiet, soothing talk.  Then it was time for the nighttime bottle, and we did that one in dim light, in a rocking chair.

Often, we would ready a story (try Goodnight Moon), still rocking.  Then, baby went to bed in his crib, and we had a CD of ocean waves that we would play.  Our first son also had a 10 gallon aquarium in his room (nice bubbling sound, dim light and very light movement).

This type of routine served us well for both babies.  Both of our sons settled well and slept through the night by four weeks.

I hope this gives you some ideas--even if your baby doesn't sleep through the night, bedtime will be enjoyable for you!</td>

<td>all breastfeeding moms- what did you do when your baby got teeth in so they learn not to bite your breast?</td>
<td>DON'T STOP BREASTFEEDING, whatever you do.  There is no reason for that!!  Shame on all those who suggested it!  

Breastfeeding is a remarkably advanced mechanism; sucking in different ways produces different types of milk and different rates of flow.  Babies know this from experience.  

By the time your baby is old enough to have teeth, he or she knows how to feed properly.  So a baby who is biting you is a baby who is no longer hungry, and is playing with you instead.  Put your finger in the corner of the baby's mouth to break the suction, and take the baby off your breast.  Do this immediately whenever he or she bites, and you will get the message across.  

Depending on how old your baby is, it might be time to start offering some alternatives anyway.  If baby has teeth, he or she should probably be introduced to solid foods and a sippy cup.  This does not replace breastmilk, and you should not stop nursing!  This is just to supplement, and can give you a break if you're still sore from a bite.  But keep trying, and baby will probably outgrow the biting phase.

<td>does having a c-section hurt during labor?</td>
<td>Well first off, the only way to tell if a baby is too big to come out is to go through labor. Late pregnancy ultrasounds are notorious for being as much as a pound off at predicting fetal weight. Also, babies' heads mold and your pelvis also flexes to accomodate the baby during labor. I am 5'6" and very slender... my baby was 9lbs 6oz and I pushed him out in less than an hour!!

Cesarean Sections are major abdominal surgery. You will not feel anything other than pressure during the proceedure because you will be numbed from the chest down. Your recovery period afterwards will be longer and more painful as your body heals. You should try to avoid a cesarean unless a vaginal birth poses extreme risks to you or your baby.</td>

<td>How do I wake baby up &amp; keep him awake DURING breastfeeding ?</td>
<td>If your baby is over a week old and of a healthy weight and is continuing to gain, it's completely safe to let them eat at their own pace... which means you don't need to try and keep him awake for a feeding if he doesn't want to feed in the first place. Newborns (again, that are healthy) can go between 6 and 8 hours without eating before they should be encouraged.
However, if he *needs* to on scheduled feedings, here's a list of things you can try to keep him alert:
Change breasts every 5 minutes
Change diaper or clothing in between breasts
Rub the jaw, up and down the spine, or the feet
Rub the head just behind the ear (most babies don't  like their head to be touched while feeding, so be careful, this can cause him to jerk his head back - ouch)
Try new positions

And last of all... WATCH and LISTEN. Sometimes mothers think that their baby is sleeping and sucking, but not actually eating. Watch his jaw and neck because he may be swallowing, which means he is still eating. Also, most of the time you should be able to hear him swallowing as well as see it.
I would suggest calling your lactation consultant or a la leche league rep if you still have concerns.

<td>What are 5 Principles of Child Development?</td>
<td>Taken together, these core values define NAEYC's basic commitment to children and underlie its position on developmentally appropriate practice.

Developmentally appropriate practice is based on knowledge about how children develop and learn. As Katz states, "In a developmental approach to curriculum design, . . . [decisions] about what should be learned and how it would best be learned depend on what we know of the learner's developmental status and our understanding of the relationships between early experience and subsequent development" (1995, 109). To guide their decisions about practice, all early childhood teachers need to understand the developmental changes that typically occur in the years from birth through age 8 and beyond, variations in development that may occur, and how best to support children's learning and development during these years.

A complete discussion of the knowledge base that informs early childhood practice is beyond the scope of this document (see, for example, Seefeldt 1992; Sroufe, Cooper, &amp; DeHart 1992; Kostelnik, Soderman, &amp; Whiren 1993; Spodek 1993; Berk 1996). Because development and learning are so complex, no one theory is sufficient to explain these phenomena. However, a broad-based review of the literature on early childhood education generates a set of principles to inform early childhood practice. Principles are generalizations that are sufficiently reliable that they should be taken into account when making decisions (Katz &amp; Chard 1989; Katz 1995). Following is a list of empirically based principles of child development and learning that inform and guide decisions about developmentally appropriate practice.

1. Domains of children's development -- physical, social, emotional, and cognitive -- are closely rela-ted. Development in one domain influences and is influenced by development in other domains.

Development in one domain can limit or facilitate development in others (Sroufe, Cooper, &amp; DeHart 1992; Kostelnik, Soderman, &amp; Whiren 1993). For example, when babies begin to crawl or walk, their ability to explore the world expands, and their mobility, in turn, affects their cognitive development. Likewise, children's language skill affects their ability to establish social relationships with adults and other children, just as their skill in social interaction can support or impede their language development.

Because developmental domains are interrelated, educators should be aware of and use these interrelationships to organize children's learning experiences in ways that help children develop optimally in all areas and that make meaningful connections across domains.

Recognition of the connections across developmental domains is also useful for curriculum planning with the various age groups represented in the early childhood period. Curriculum with infants and toddlers is almost solely driven by the need to support their healthy development in all domains. During the primary grades, curriculum planning attempts to help children develop conceptual understandings that apply across related subject-matter disciplines.

2. Development occurs in a relatively orderly sequence, with later abilities, skills, and knowledge building on those already acquired.

Human development research indicates that relatively stable, predictable sequences of growth and change occur in children during the first nine years of life (Piaget 1952; Erikson 1963; Dyson &amp; Genishi 1993; Gallahue 1993; Case &amp; Okamoto 1996). Predictable changes occur in all domains of development -- physical, emotional, social, language, and cognitive -- although the ways that these changes are manifest and the meaning attached to them may vary in different cultural contexts. Knowledge of typical development of children within the age span served by the program provides a general framework to guide how teachers prepare the learning environment and plan realistic curriculum goals and </td>

<td>It's definitely up to the mother and the child. Kudos to you for going 8 months. Like someone said earlier, any breastfeeding that you did is awesome. As I'm sure you know, the first 6 weeks of baby's life is the most important time for mother's milk, as it builds their immune system. It gives your child a boost developmentally and physically. The benefits of breastfeeding are countless and recent research as shown that it is okay to continue as long as the mother and child are mutually satisfied, so that could be 8 months, 18 months, or even 2 or 3 years! But it's all up to you. My son is still nursing (he's 7 1/2 months) and he's getting his first tooth right now so we'll see how long I can hang in there!</td>

What I did was gave him the 6oz and a pacifier afterwards and he was fine.  He might not be hungry but still wants to suck. More than 6oz is too much because his stomach is small and it will come back up anyway(I learned the hard way). Also if you give him cereal too early he might develop an allergy because his body is not ready to digest it. I waited until 3 and a half month and only a teaspoon of cereal and get a faster flow nipple so it will come thru.</td>

<td>My 3 mth old  twins have acid reflux, any ideas on how to keep formula down?</td>
<td>Here in the Uk there is something called Carobel that is made by Cow &amp; Gate. MY daughter suffered from reflux from birth til she was 6 months. She's now 9 months. Carobel is a thickening agent that you add to the formula to help it stay in babys' stomach. It worked a treat for us. You can also buy Infant Gavisgon. This works slightly different in creating a layer onto of the formual to stop it coming back up (also to be added direct to formula). We were prescribed this first by the doctor but didn't find it any good. I was suggested Carobel by someone who was told to try it by a peadiatrican.
There is also special formula, for example, SMA Staydown which is made to try and help keep it down.

Reflux WILL get better with age. I didn't think it would get better, we were going thru one bib every 30mins at one point but as soon as we started her on solids, we gradually took away the carobel and haven't had a problem since.

Best thing to do would be to see a doctor. They can refer you to a specialist at the hospital who can give a drug called Ranitidine which is almost like a cure for reflux.

<td>It could be an allergic reaction to something.  When he was about 6 months old, my son got rash on his face and body after drinking dairy products (in some formulas and from mom).  If you suspect it's an allergic reaction and you're nursing, you should stop eating all dairy, eggs, wheat, and nuts.  Make sure your baby is not eating any of these either.  If it clears up after a few days, then it's probably a food allergy your baby is having.  
During some rash outbreaks, we would give our baby children's liquid benadryl to reduce the itching.  It seemed to help.

Our son is now 20 months old, and he did outgrow the food allergy at about 16 months.

<td>Usually urine smells for one of two reasons: 1.) There is an infection of the urinary tract, bladder or kidneys. But that usually presents with other symptoms of crying and fever. 

The second reason could be concentration. If the babe isn't drinking enough fluids, the concentration of urine is stronger. Make sure that he's drinking enough breastmilk or formula and has access or you offer water throughout your day.

You might notice if there are any certain times when this happens - is it always just in the morning after a long night? After a certain food?

Those are some ideas....of course you can always refer to your pediatrician.</td>

<td>How can I entertain a 3 month old?</td>

Please don't sit her in front of the television so soon - she has NO idea what's going on. At this young age, what a baby still wants most is touch, holding, cuddling, one-on-one interaction with the people she loves. If you're finding that you're not getting things done because she wants to be held so often, try a sling carrier so she can still be 'held', but you'll have your hands free.

Don't worry, it won't be long before she is more content to play by herself and not need to be held all the time. Treasure the cuddles while they last. :)</td>

Then also included photos of first haircut, first teeth, first walking, first food, first smile, first photo, &amp; 1st birthday.

Book2: before he was here &amp; 1st year:
Pictures of dad &amp; me &amp; our families.  Pix of us as kids.  Pictures of pregnancy sticks, ultrasound copies, and pictures of me pregnant (1 lo for entire time, photo for each month on it), baby shower photos, then at the hospital the usual-after birth, going home, with dad, etc...  then 1 2 page layout for each month-1st month highlights, 2nd month, etc.  Tried to put photos of his 1st time meeting important people in.

If you want ideas beyond just photos, you can include hairlock, foot &amp; hand prints, lists of fav foods, what a typical day or week in their life was.

just before he wakes be there near him so hes not alone.
Also you could try (if weather permits)to take him out side talking gently about the things out side you can both see.
Then tell him what you are both going to do when you go pack in the house.
Dont worry, things will be fine in no time, you sound like a great mom.
Just change his wake up routine so when he wakes up there is some special thing he and you are going to do.

<td>Is  abortion  consedired against god ? is it a crime ? do you realy kill a human being  ? What do you think?</td>
<td>I have never seen a scripture passage which reads: "Abort not."
It is, at least in some circumstances, not illegal in the USA at this point in time, however, the composition of the US Supreme Court is changing and this might also change.
No human alive knows when the soul enters a human body that is forming.  There is no way to scientifically determine this event.  Moreover, there is no direct scripture which gives this information either.  The Bible does repeatedly speak about the "Breath of Life, however."
A planted acorn is not an oak tree.
Unlike most other humans, I avoid this issue.  I truthfully believe that Divinity will judge human actions better than any group of humans (by moral or civil law).  I take this to be a personal issue between the conceivers and Divinity, and interference by humans is not in the best interest of society.
Consider this:  There is a high correlation between unloved children becoming psychopathic adults.  It is possible that an abortion might save the lives of many innocent people later.  How would the world be different if Hitler's mom aborted him.
On the other hand, what great poetry might never be written or scientific discovery lost to humans because a selfish woman thought more of her own wishes than wanting to take the time to raise a child?</td>

His diaper stays dry for several hours; he knows "bathroom" words such as pee, poop, and wet, or whatever terms your family uses; he's interested in watching other family members use the toilet. It's also helpful if your child can pull his or her diaper up or down.</td>

<td>do i have to ask the doctor before i switch baby formulas?</td>
<td>You can ask the doctor first, but it is not necessary. All he will tell you is to try another and see if it is the same. Not all babies are the same and at times even milk that Paediatrician prescribes needs to be changed. As long as the tin marks the age that is you baby' age then you can try it. Probably if the milk contain iron that could be the problem. Mix the milk as directed by the tin. Mixing it too strong could could cause constipation. Always measure the water first and then put in the milk.

For example if the tin states to mix 1 scope of formula to 2 ounces of water, then measure 2 ounces of purified or boiled water and then add the the milk. After mixing you might get allittle over the 2 ounces, but it is because of the scope of milk the water was 2 ounces.

I works in a newborn Nursery and I have experience with this at times.</td>

<td>Any tips for a 2 month old that doesnt stop throwing up?</td>
<td>take him to a doctor who knows what they are talking about. Sounds like it might be acid reflux and maybe they can give the baby something to help. If your baby throws up too much he/she could lose weight then welfare will turn that around on you crying child neglect. Get a second opinion and a third if necessary and then if they all say he is fine then he probably is. One way or the other if things go bad you have back up to show you took your baby to several doctors. Also make sure you are getting good burps out of your baby when they eat or they could spit up a lot because it's sitting on an air pocket.</td>

<td>my 8 month old baby was sleeping all night but all of a sudden he gets up should i let him fuss?</td>
<td>My daughter went through a similar time. I found that, often, if I let her cry for a couple of minutes before I went to her, she often fell asleep before I had to get up. On the other hand, if I did go in to her, she often seemed to get even more upset. I cannot explain why she started night waking, but it was just a phase that we worked though by letting her cry as long as it wasn't for too long or as long as her cry didn't sound like one of pain. I'd recommend checking out babycenter.com and also the series of Baby Whisperer books...both have great information about sleep and lots of other issues. Good luck!</td>

<td>my 4.5 mo baby doesn't drink her milk-it's lucky if she consumes 12 oz/day--she drinks milk only when sleepy</td>
<td>By 4 1/2 months your baby should still drink at least 32 oz. a day of milk. If your child is having trouble keeping it down, maybe they are lactose intorlerant, try a soy formula. By that age the baby could drink juice, my suggestion is to stick with gerber juices, but if you need to go cheap, try some juicey juice.  I don't know where you are in the feeding schedual, but by this time they should also be getting rice cereal, it will make the formula sweeter. I hope some of those things helped, but just in case, keep a look out for the signs of dehydration: dry lips, mouth not as wet, eyes don't look wet, and less wet diapers, and your doctor will be able to give you some good tips as well, don't be afraiod to call.</td>

<td>my friend has a premature baby,it is a must to breastfeed her premature baby?</td>
<td>Okay...I am a NICU nurse.  It's not a MUST to breastfeed. However, breastmilk should be looked at as a MEDICINE to a premature infant.  Preemies have very delicate GI systems and digestion can be a huge problem...causing serious problems that could even lead to death. The use of breastmilk can dramatically cut this risk, though it does not totally eliminate it.  Your friend's breastmilk is the best thing that her baby can be given b/c the enzymes, proteins, etc in her breastmilk will MATCH what her infant needs at this stage of prematurity. Isn't that cool?  Your body makes milk to match your premature baby's needs!!  The medical staff may decide to bulk up the calories of the milk, but, the benefits still remain.  Remind her that she does NOT have to directly breastfeed her infant when the baby is discharged from the hospital and that she may even decide to stop pumping before the baby goes home. However, encourage her to continue pumping as much as possible to give the best nutrition available to her baby!!  yea for her!!!</td>

The fertilised ovum, or embryo then moves down the Fallopian tube to the uterus. In the uterus, the embryo attaches itself to the membrane wall and grows.

If baby is fed and dry and comfortable, swaddle baby in blanket so that arms/legs are close to body and rock baby in your arms.  You could also try holding baby in your arms, sitting on the edge of your bed and lightly bounce up and down on the mattress.  That helped a lot when my daughter had colic.  Remember, it is usually a phase that will pass when your baby gets older.  If baby is crying every day for hours at a time, visit the pediatrician to go over possible reasons (colic, reflux, etc.).

<td>why infants from 8th week starts pooping  in 4 5 days?</td>
<td>Newborns have frequent stools as they rid their bodies of meconium and amnoitic fluid that they drank inutero.  After a few weeks, most breastfed babies stool much less frequently (once a day to once a week is fairly normal).  This is because breastmilk has very little waste, so it takes a while for waste to accumlate in the bowel.  In formula fed infants, however, it is abnormal for stooling to happen less than every other day.  Also, in all infants, if the stool is not soft, this indicates consitpation and the baby should be evaluted by a doctor because they may strain to eliminate and cause damage.  Hope this helps.</td>

If she wants to though, she can pump a little after each nursing to get the leftovers out and store it in the freezer for later. It should help cut down on leaking if she does it that way. It takes quite a while for the breasts to adjust to baby's schedule, as they work on supply and demand.

<td>list of things to buy for a newborn baby?</td>
<td>Equipment for Newborn (0-6months): 
breasts (lactating preferably) 
loving arms and laps (three sets are ideal, as long as the owners all get along) 
regular garden variety home (running water, tub, toilet, roof, floor, bed, food, etc.) 
sling(s)/front pack/backpack (for later) 
blankies and quilts, assorted, for putting on floor to cover up dog hair (doesn't everyone have dog hair?), for crashing under wherever you end up nursing 
sports bottles, filled with water and strategically placed at nursing spots around the house 
bouncy seat in bathroom as a putting place for baby during peeing and showering, unless baby cries (then, you juggle) 
a large repertoire of songs--lullabye, silly, operatic, popular, kid-- complete with hand gestures and facial expressions 
battery operated swing (especially if your colicky baby likes motion. NOTE: this is not a replacement for arms and laps, but a diversion for up to 30 minutes total A DAY.) 
onesies/singlets (we always had 6 of each size) 
booties or socks, nothing fancy 
an outerwear outfit 
car seat--five point harness is best and can be used with newborn, rear-facing, and convert to front-facing up to 40lbs; but sometimes an infant seat is more comfy for baby 
lots and lots of really cheap cloth wash rags (12-20; approx. $4 per dozen), dish towels (I won't pay more than $1 ea.), and birdseye diapers (a dozen is fine) 
one or two really lush hooded towels 
one or two of those rubber/flannel sheets for use on changing table/area and in the family bed (a must-have when the flu runs through the family) 
Toys for baby: 
keys (you'll find out why) 
black-and-white greeting cards work just as well as expensive baby flash cards 
any kind of book, non-toxic, for baby to hold and nibble and 'read' 
For new parents: 
computer and modem, and email support list addresses ;-) 
cordless phone 
LLL schedule, AP playgroup meeting schedule or similar 
Books: Sears is good but I think _Baby Games_ is an absolute must, required reading for beginning and experienced anyone. 
List of local thrift shops within driving distance, ie, between nursings 
Diaper Stuff: 
diapers, 3 to 5 dozen cloth if you wash 1-2 a week. 
a stash of disposable diapers in the event of diarrhea (if you're stressed out caring for a sick baby, the last thing you want to worry about is how many diapers are being soiled, will need washing, etc.) 
grocery bags for dirty diapers while away from home 
diaper bag/purse for mom 
plastic trash can or vented laundry hamper for diaper pail 
a few washable bibs (see Diaper Guide) 

Baby's toiletries: 
a bulb syringe/nasal syringe 
baby cream for the bum and for massage 
Rescue Remedy 
Chamomillia 
Hyland's Teething Tablets 
Baby Simethicone 
Baby Tylenol/Motrin (use when recommended by dr.) (Advil is a Nestle product) 
Baby shampoo (use for bath too) Later: 
generic high chair (later) (some babies prefer sitting in Mom's lap and preventing her from eating at all) safety and childproofing items 

Homemade disposable baby wipes:
Take a roll of paper towels (Bounty has worked the best) and cut it in half. Use a large Tupperware-style container and place the roll inside. Add enough of a weak baby bath/baby shampoo and water solution to soak the towels throughly. Remove the cardboard core and pull the wipes out from the center. Store in a cool to room temperature place. Baby can even suck on a wet one without much harm.</td>

<td>could you train a baby not wake up in the morning while his in the belly of his mother.?</td>
<td>lol no. You can however play certain music at perhaps a certain time of day and the baby will recogize it outside of the womb. It may help to soothe him and put him back to sleep because it's something he's used to hearing. When I was pregnant with my first daughter I watched All My Children everyday. After I had her when the show would come on she would stop nursing and turn her head towards the tv when the song for the show came on.</td>

<td>how do i cure an infants constipation?</td>
<td>WOW...okay, lots of bad advice on here.....  FIRST, NEVER stick a thermometer up your child's rectum.... You could perforate the rectum (this requires surgery).  Secondly, how old is your child?  Describe what you mean by "constipation?"  When was your child's last stool?  Babies do NOT have to stool each day...they can go up to one week sometimes... It's OK, as long as they are not vomiting, decreasing their intake, straining for a BM, etc.  THIRDLY, do NOT take your child off of Iron containing formula w/o consulting your pediatrician.  BABIES NEED IRON in their diets...  They have mild anemia from birth and need it folks!  yes, it DOES contribute to some constipation issues sometimes, but, it's better than an anemic infant!!  We can work with the constipation.  The best advice I read on here would be one juice bottle 4 oz of prune juice each day.  Please answer my questions and then I will help you some more!</td>

<td>how long should we wait to tak eour newborn out into public?</td>
<td>Hmm...it mostly depends on how confident you are in the environment in which you live and in your baby's immune system. From what I've heard, you can take your baby out after about 1 week after coming home from the hospital. It is a good idea because it gets the baby used to the environment, the different mild viruses that exist everywhere and so it strengthens their health. However, as I said...some mothers are scared because they think their baby is too sensitive (when in fact they're stronger than you'd think). If you're not like that, don't wait too long! :)</td>

you can try liquid colace, over the counter. or karo light (the clear one)syrup in milk, it will make it sweet. this is only if she wont eat prunes or pears, and you have no choice.
if she is presently constipated the best thing is these tiny infant LIQUID suppositories, they always work well, just a bit traumatic. i have to give them to my 3 yr old a lot. they are however for infants, but still work great. make sure you use vaseline, and tell her mommy loves you :-(

<td>My 9 m old baby has sleeping probs at night. Once he is asleep he sleeps tight. Problem is to put him to sleep</td>
<td>Create a bedtime routine and give your baby a comforting transitional object, such as a blanket or a stuffed animal (until he's a year old, though, don't put it in the crib with him, as it can increase his risk of SIDS). Put him down while he's sleepy but still awake, so he can settle himself and learn to fall asleep on his own.

Babies can get quite attached to their bedtime ritual; if you change it, your baby may have difficulty getting to sleep, so stick with the program and plan for a quiet time before bed. Of course, some babies will resist bedtime anyway, calling to you repeatedly. This may be due to separation anxiety — your baby feels uneasy when you're out of sight.</td>

<td>Where does the baby sit in a taxi?</td>
<td>good question
I had this situation - stroller was put into the trunk and I held the baby - the cabby didn't say anything so I assume it was alright to do.

I would think that if he would get a ticket for that - that he wouldn't allow it... 

I really am not 100% on this though.. maybe it's the parents responsibility so if the police pulled him over - we would be the ones to get a ticket for not having them in the car seat.  But It wasn't a problem for us...

Wether it's the law or not... for saftey's sake - You should wear a seatbelt - but Do Not strap it around your baby with you - if you were to stop short - your pressure (from your body weight) against the baby into the seatbelt could kill it.  Instead if you plan to do alot of cab riding - buy a harness (like cloth baby carrier that you wear in front of you) for the baby to sit in.  This way you are belted in and the baby is belted to YOU.  You won't crush the baby with your body weight - like you could if the baby was in your seat belt with you.</td>

<td>First of all, YEAH for you for reconsidering. As you know, it's the best thing you can do for your infant! :)  AND as you know, it's ROUGH!!!  La Leche Leagues are helpful for some moms; however, some consider them to be a little extreme.  My advice would be to read many of their books and if the meetings are for you; go for it!!  Secondly, request at least one consult with a lactation consultant while in the hospital.  This is prime time to get that baby rolling with breastfeeding.  If you feel that breastfeeding is not successfully established in the hospital, get a consultant to come to your home.  A little pricey, but, DEFINITELY worth it's weight in gold.  Lastly, try to keep your infant with you during your entire postpartum stay.  Try Kangaroo Care (skin to skin) contact to allow baby to go to breast OFTEN during the first days (like pretty much around the clock!).  CONGRATULATIONS and best wishes with your new little miracle!</td>

<td>what is a good way to tell your the dad with out doing a dna test?</td>
<td>It doesn't take blood to make a dad. If you love a child and want to raise this baby as your own, Why not? There are so many dead beat dads and moms alike that children now days need all that they can get. If she is telling you that you are the father why not be the father. If you have some doubt of course you should speak up. Children now days are getting the beef for things that they have no control over. Another point is you don't have to be with someone to take a child as your own. 
Make sure that before you go on this journey your heart is ready. You don't ever want to make a child feel that it is their fault. Sure it may be bumpy but it doesn't take sperm to be a father......

Good luck!!!!</td>

<td>Get 3 or 4 books on the subject.  Get some notecards (index cards), and write a fact on each notecard, getting as many notecards as you can on the subject.  Then arrange the notecards in categories, then put them in a logical order.  Then write the report based on those cards, making the sentences join in a logical manner, adding your own stuff in there.  DO NOT COPY ANYTHING EXACTLY FROM THE BOOK0--that is plagarism and not allowed.  When you are done, look up how to do "works cited" on the internet.  You will find many sites to show you how to put references at the end of the paper (a list of books you used to write the report).  This way takes work, but if you learn how to do it, it will help you out not only when you have to do term papers, but also in college.</td>

<td>can an 40 year have a baby?</td>
<td>A woman can have a baby at any age as long as she still has viable eggs and is in reasonably good health. Having a baby after 35 does, however, become more risky.

Women are born with all of the eggs they will ever have. As a woman ages, so do her eggs. The aging of the eggs may make it harder for the woman to get pregnant. There is also a higher risk of birth defects, notably Down Syndrome.

There are other issues to consider as well. How old will you be when your child graduates from high school and goes out on their own? Will you have the energy to run and play with your child? Have you been without children up until this time? Can you accept the enormous lifestyle changes that come with having a child?

Women can have children beyond age 40, even beyond age 50. There are just some different concerns to discuss with your ob/gyn.</td>

<td>The world's lightest twin birth weight is Courtney and Chloe Smith of Alexandria, LA were born March 1, 2000 weighing 12 ounces and 12.5 ounces respectively. After a 4.5 month stay in the CHRISTUS St. Frances Cabrini Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, the Smith Twins were doing fine and attend Nachman Elementary School in Alexandria, LA. In 2000 they were chosen as the Louisiana Representatives for the Foresters Champions Across America and Canada promoting Children's Miracle Network.

The heaviest birth weight born to Mrs. J.P. Haskin of Arkansas, on February 20 1924, totallying 27 lbs 12ozs. A set born in England, the Warren's weighed a total of 25lbs 8 ozs at their birth on December 6 1884. Another set of twins born in 1997 by Judy Anderson of Wilson, North Carolina weighed a combined  total of 18 lb 10 oz.

Anna Bates (née Swan) (Canada) (1846–88), who measured 2.27 m (7 ft 5.5 in) tall, gave birth to a boy weighing 10.8 kg (23 lb 12 oz) and measuring 76 cm (30 in) long, at her home in Seville, Ohio, USA, on January 19, 1879, but the baby died 11 hours later.
The heaviest baby born to a healthy mother was a boy weighing 10.2 kg (22 lb 8 oz) who was born to Sig. Carmelina Fedele (Italy) at Aversa, Italy in September 1955.

It was reported in a letter to the British Medical Journal (1 February 1879) from a doctor in Torpoint, Cornwall, UK, that a child born on Christmas Day 1852 weighed 9.5 kg (21 lb).

The only other reported birthweight in excess of 9 kg (2O lb) is 9.13 kg (20 lb 2 oz) for a boy born to a 33-year-old schoolmistress in Crewe, Cheshire, UK on November 12, 1884.

Guy Warwick Carr was born on March 9, 1992, the eighth child of Andrew and Nicola Carr (who measured 1.57 m (5ft 2in) tall) of Kirkby-in-Furness, Cumbria, UK, weighing 7 kg (15 lb 8 oz). He was 63 cm (25 in) in length and midwives at the Maternity Unit had to raid the Childrens Ward for nappies and clothes large enough to fit him. 

The lowest birth weight recorded for a surviving infant, of which there is definite evidence, is 260 g (9.17 oz) in the case of Rumaisa Rahman (USA) who was born at Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois, USA, on 19 September 2004 at 25 weeks 6 days gestation.</td>

<td>Like the others have said, exercise and diet are very important. Eat lots of fruit and veggies, drink milk. Even if you crave sweets and junk food, try to avoid them as much as you can. 

You will get a lot of advice and old wives tales from friends and relative...a lot of it isn't true. Make sure you are under the care of a doctor, and if you aren't sure about something, ask him/her. 

Get enough sleep at night, but also get enough exercise in the daytime. Most of the things you have been doing in the past are still ok for you to do when you are pregnant. For instance, if you've been a jogger, it's ok to keep jogging, but it's not a great time to take up a vigorous sport if you haven't already been doing it. 

Bathing won't hurt you. If you prefer showers, then shower, but taking a bath is not going to hurt you.

If you have morning sickness, keep some saltine crackers next to your bed and eat one or two before you get out of bed. Later in your pregnancy, if your feet or ankles swell, prop your feet up in the evening for a little while. 

Enjoy your pregnancy and the life growing inside you. It's an amazing adventure.</td>

<td>What does it mean for a baby to be Coombs positive?</td>
<td>An indirect Coombs' test determines whether there are antibodies to the Rh factor in the mother’s blood.

A normal (negative) result means that the mother has not developed antibodies against the fetus's blood. A negative Coombs' test indicates that the fetus is not presently in danger from problems relating to Rh incompatibility.
An abnormal (positive) result means that the mother has developed antibodies to the fetal red blood cells and is sensitized. However, a positive Coombs' test only indicates that an Rh-positive fetus has a possibility of being harmed. A positive test cannot indicate the amount of fetal harm that has occurred or is likely to occur.
If test results show that antibody amounts are increasing during pregnancy, the fetus may be at greater risk of harm.

A fetus who is Rh-negative will not be harmed, even if the mother is sensitized.</td>

<td>Babies should ONLY have formula or breastmilk until 4 months - nothing else.

4 months - add rice cereal mixed with formula on a spoon

6 months - add baby foods

The main reason not to give the coconut oil is that it will cause you to give less formula, which is what a baby needs.

<td>what can i do for a very hyper 11 month old?  Is this normal to be hyper at this age?</td>
<td>I was very hyper as a child. I used to run in circles around the room as I got older and my mother decided to try some ADHD medications. She tells me now that she regrets this however (due to the effects) She said it made me someone I wasn't meant to be. Looking back, she says she looks at me as a "hummingbird", always moving and always on the go. A hyper child is going to be hyper without medication, and you just have to accept that that's who they're going to be and love them for it. The more you let him/her get that energy out during the day, the less you have to deal with at the end of the day. Some children have a reaction to certain things like red food die, sugar, etc. which cause them to become hyper. I found this website that might help you to understand. One thing that is wrong with the wwebsite in my opinion is the assumption that ADD, ADHD, and simple hyperactivity are all the same. Treat this site like it is talking about hyperactivity. If you think your child might have ADHD, you can have them tested when they learn to speak. My mother has worke with thousands of children with all kinds of conditions, and many normally behaved children. Just remember not to treat the ADD like an illness. It's not a "disorder"; it's a personality. Treating it negatively can have some severely adverse effects in the future.

<td>Check with your pediatrician for this. If he says it's ok, start with infant cereals. Wait several days to introduce a new food after each one to see if there is an allergic reaction. Otherwise, you won't know what the baby is allergic to. Don't feed the baby what you eat. It's probably got too much salt and spices that aren't good for your baby. Expect the baby to make faces and push the food out with his tongue. This doesn't mean he doesn't like it. It's a new experience and he has to learn to manipulate the food to the back of his mouth. There is also the issue of texture. He's used to liquids. Be patient, enjoy the experience and keep your camera close. You will have a lot of laughs and you are going to want to get pictures.

Burp her, change her diaper, feed her, etc. Sometimes they are over stimulated and you can try wrapping her in a blanket (called "papoosing") and this will calm them. Walking with them sometimes works, as does driving them around in the car (in a car seat, of course). Good luck...and try not to get too frustrated.

I don't believe in spanking except extreme cases, but in a few months I'll probably have to start giving her a smack on her hand.  Of course in a few months she'll be able to get into the DVD's!  Can't wait!

To answer your question, start now with a few things that she shouldn't be doing.  Don't have too many things out, though, getting onto her all day will be stressful for both of you.  Later she'll be able to reach and manipulate more, and you can add no-no's as she gets older.  

Now is the best time to start to discipline.</td>

<td>Absoluely. And, if something were to happen that the pump you got had been used (unbeknownst to you), let it ease your mind that the breastmilk does not actually go inside of the actual pump. (At least with the Medela pump-in-style, which I highly recommend.) Simply buy a brand new set of tubing and the actual parts that collect milk. Then you can rest easy.

<td>Is it safe to bring a newborn around someone who has Polio (the baby has not been immunizied yet)?</td>

If the person had polio once (like when they were a child) and have some side effects (my grandmother's husband has a limp from polio), there is no risk to the baby.  If, however, this person really does have active polio, I would be cautious about being around them.  Polio virus is transimitted through stool, so good handwashing should prevent transimission, but I'm not certain I would take that risk with my newborn.  Perhaps you could wait to see this individual for a few months until the baby has recieved the vaccine.</td>

There really isn't that much blood involved.  You should know that during the labor and delivery it's ALL about the mama and if she swears and screams at you that she hates you (she really doesn't) now is not the time to argue with her.  You've got to take EVERYTHING in stride and be very calm, supportive, and encouraging.  I wouldn't let my husband say a word and I wouldn't let him touch me either.  The only thing I wanted him for was to squeeze his hand.  I love him dearly but anything else was overwhelming for me.  The pain is pretty intense - especially without drugs.  You can expect that she'll be very vocal about it especially towards the end.  You should know that if baby isn't the only thing she pushes out it's completly normal and the doctors won't even bat an eye to that.  After the baby comes out she has to push out the placenta a few minutes later.  You should be prepared for a C-section too.  Look into that.. I really don't know a lot about that but it does happen.  You should know that your entire life is going to change for the better.  CONGRATULATIONS!  Best of luck!</td>

<td>How do I get my 5 month old baby to sleep through the night?</td>

Also, could s/he be teething? I know my son started to wake more at about that age and he got two teeth. If so, check with your pediatrician to see if some infant tylenol before bed might help.

Don't listen to all the "self soothing" and "cry it out" advice. There is a reason why it goes against your mothering instinct and you shouldn't ignore that. Crying is your baby's only way of communicating with you at this point and teaching him his cry is meaningless only makes him insecure. Read the book "The No Cry Sleep Solution" by Elizabeth Pantley. It was very helpful for my family. We have an 9 month old who sleeps through the night and was never allowed to "cry it out".</td>

Another thing you may want to do is ask that no one hold or touch the baby before they wash their hands with soap,and please do not come if they or anyone in their home is sick, has a cold or the sniffles.
Be direct and consistent, don't be rude just direct. Make it stand for all visitors. 
Remember this is your baby and you are the one that will be taking care of him? when he is sick in the middle of the night. Whose baby is it?

My example:
   I charge $7 per hour for one child from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.
because I figure they are awake during that time. Then it goes down to $2.50 per hour the rest of the hours. Though they are sleeping, there is always the chance they'll wake, have diahrea, throw up..you still are on call.

Hope that helps.  Believe me, they'll be glad to have someone who'll watch those off hours. Most don't.

Your son still desperately needs both the nutrition and the protective benefits from breastfeeding that formula cannot give him.  Sure, many survive on formula, but is it inferior to your milk, which is made specifically for your son.  Did you know that the composition of your milk changes as his needs change?

Try feeding her "on demand" or mix a very little bit of rice cereal in with the milk, sounds like she's going through a growth spurt. You should talk to your pediatrician if you're worried, they can tell you if she's getting enough or not.

Please do not give her yogurt or milk, as babies cannot break down cows milk at that young of an age and she will get gassy and have other problems.

<td>why do some babies not crawl?</td>
<td>Some babies prefer not to crawl. My son just barely started at 7 months, which is a perfectly normal age. Others skip it in favor of other ways of getting around and then when they learn to walk they see no need to crawl.

Some studies have shown that babies who do not crawl have a higher incidence of dyslexia as children and adults. It has something to do with not learning the specific order of coordinating hands and legs involved in crawling. I wouldn't worry about this baby, just make sure that you (or baby's parents, siblings or other babies) get on the floor and crawl around with him, teaching him. Put things out of his reach and place him on his belly. DON'T give in and give him the things he wants (toys etc) but make him get them himself. He may simply have no motivation to go get anything if it's always brought to him. He also may not have any models if he's an only child or doesn't see others crawling around. I do "push ups" with my baby to encourage him to get his belly off the ground as well as crawling around with him. Make it a game, not a chore. You'll have fun, as well as finding out what possible dangers are on the floor for baby. :-)</td>

Our children are growing up just fine, thank you very much.  They are well adjusted and doing great in school.  They are not sucking their thumbs or wearing diapers or in any other way showing signs that we babied them too much.  The benefit is they feel VERY secure and loved.

<td>How can i make my baby stop getting used to the arms?</td>
<td>Your baby wants to be in your arms because she NEEDS to. She was in your belly for over 9 months, that made her very very close to you. When she is being held, she feels warmth, love, and can even hear your heartbeat. Your baby CANNOT become spoiled because you hold her, this is one of her needs as a tiny baby. Let her be older, and she will eventually stop needing to be held :o)</td>

<td>How do you get rid of a flea infestation?</td>
<td>Treat pets, home, and yard.....

Feline Flea Proofing
Add to the food for each adult cat:
1/2 level teaspoon brewer's yeast
1/4 level teaspoon garlic powder

Flea Destroyer
Set up a plate of sudsy water with a light hovering over it. The fleas are attracted to this and drown themselves.

Flea Repellent (for cats)
1/8 teaspoon tamari soy sauce
1 crushed whole clove
1/8 teaspoon water
1 fresh garlic clove
Marinate the garlic in the liquid for about 10 minutes and then remove it.
Add 1/16 teaspoon soy liquid to each 1/2 cup cat food. Use this repellent immediately.

Flea Repellent Pillows
These pillows are for dogs.
Source: Glen Brook Farms Herbs and Such
2 parts pennyroyal
1 part thyme
1 part wormwood
Herbs may be cut or whole; construct a pillow for your pet to sleep on and then stuff it with the pennyroyal, thyme, wormwood. This makes a nice gift for those favorite dogs in your life. These herbs help to repel fleas naturally and without harsh chemicals.

Flea Repellent Sleep Pillows
For cats
2 parts sage or rosemary
1 part catnip
1 part chamomile
For dogs
2 parts pennyroyal
1 part thyme
1 part wormwood
Herbs may be used cut or whole. Mix enough to stuff a 2-foot square pillow for a cat or a 3-foot square (or larger) pillow for a dog. Sew the pillowcase out of a tough, washable fabric such as denim.

Herbal Flea Powder
Use herbs in powdered form only.
2 ounces pennyroyal (use sage or rosemary for cats)
1 ounce rosemary
1 ounce wormwood
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Mix and store in a covered container. Use as often as any flea powder and rub into skin.
DO NOT LET POWDER GET INTO PET'S EYES.

Herbal Flea Powder
1 part eucalyptus powder
1 part pennyroyal powder (use sage or rosemary for cats)
1 part fennel powder
1 part yellow dock powder
Combine all ingredients in a shaker top jar and shake to mix.
Apply to your pet's fur by brushing backward with your hand or comb and sprinkling the powder into the roots of the hairs. Concentrate on the neck, back, and belly. Use just enough to add a little odor to the hairs.
For severe flea infestations, treat daily; otherwise, use two or three times a week.

<td>How to teach my 4 month old baby reading?</td>
<td>If you mean to ask how to set the foundation for reading, then talk to him or her slowly and gently, explaining things like, "Now you're going to the tub. It feels warm in the tub." Sing songs - find a few songs that make the baby happy (my baby loves "if you're happy and you know it" and the ABC song) and sing them over and over again.

Some children are ready to start learning letters as early as 3 years old, but others are only ready much later (age 5+), so just see what is right for your child.

At 2 years old, for example, it is much more important for your child to know that a circle is round than how to spell the word circle.</td>

<td>what age is should you introduce a cup to your child and when is the best age to take the bottle away?</td>
<td>i've already introduced a cup (a regular cup, not a sippy) to my daughter. i introduced the cup when she was 5 months old. she is now 8 months. i still have to hold it and pour the liquid into her mouth, but she knows how she has to move her mouth in order to drink from a cup. she doesn't spill any of it. 

**in my opinion (PLEASE NOTE, my opinion), people shouldn't give sippy cups to their children. sippy cups make it easy for children to walk around all day sipping on milk, water, juice, whatever. this spoils their appetite. it also makes it harder for potty training. when a child drinks liquid with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and maybe a couple times in between, it is easier for you to know when they will pee. if they've been drinking all day, it makes it difficult to know when they will pee because they are peeing all day. also, sippy cups don't really make a good transition from bottle to cup because the child still has to suck the liquid, just like a bottle.</td>

<td>is gentian violet safe for use on infants?</td>
<td>One should be careful not to apply too much Gentian Violet to the tongue per day because many infants are sensitive to it and can develop blistering in the back of the mouth and throat. This is a painful situation for the baby. Typical use is to dip only the tip of a Q tip in the solution then rub the tip around the top of the bottle to get some of the excess off of the Q-tip before applying. Then rub it over the infected area to include the back of the tongue and the sides of the mouth inside the cheek area. It should be done no more than 3 times a day. If the thrush does not improve in 2 weeks, stop use. As far as I know, there are no known studies regarding long term use of Gentian Violet and after two weeks, the infant may develop mouth sores or blisters. One thing to remember about Gentian Violet is that the results are not immediate. Most people notice a difference in about one week, however, typically it is less painful for infants to breastfeed after an application of Gentian Violet.</td>

<td>Baby Question?</td>
<td>okay...first only BACK to sleep now!   SIDS has decreased by 50% since we started recommending ONLY backs for sleeping.  Secondly, do it now before baby needs to sleep with you at 6 months, etc.  Place baby down when she's DROWSY not totally to sleep. Talk to her while gently rubbing her little face until she doses off...  Then, decrease the amount of time that you stand at the crib with her each time.  Eventually, she'll learn to EASE herself to sleep.  This is AMAZING b/c when she wakes up at 3am (after she quits taking nighttime breastfeeding/bottles). She'll know that SHE can ease HERSELF back to sleep WITHOUT YOU!!! yeeaaaaa!!  This is the best thing you can do for your baby!!  A white noise machine or womb sounds machine is a great investment too...  Kudos for doing what's best for baby!</td>

<td>Why can't mother's milk be bottled and sold in markets as milk for babies?</td>
<td>Couple of reasons:
1) Expensive to "harvest".  In other words, its cost prohibitive to collect milk from pregnant mothers.  One mother doesn't produce nearly as much milk as one cow.
2) Expensive to process.  In other words, once you collected the milk, you would have to take it to a central facility for processing and pasteurization
3) Without processing and pasteurization, the milk would go bad quickly.
4) No quality control.  Who knows what bad things the mothers could be ingesting (medicines, drugs, alcohol, etc.) that would wind up in their milk.  How would you control the consistency and quality of the milk?
5) No demand.  I wouldn't chance having some unknown mother's milk going into my baby.</td>

<td>Why do they tell you to wait 6 weeks after youve had a baby to have sex even if youve had a cesearean?</td>
<td>one is to avoid the risk of pregnancy because a pregnancy that soon could cause major damage to both mom and baby. Also, the uterus has to have time to heal, especially after a c-section. Your cervix still dilates and needs time to get back to normal. There's the surgical scars which need to heal and can be easily reopened by the action of sex. There's also the fact that your uterus is more open and prone to infection during those first 6 weeks, which is why they also tell you no tampons after baby is born until the next period (which can be months and months away if you're breastfeeding exclusively!!!! 7 months and counting). 

Besides, your hormones need to get back into control and it can take a few months for your muscle coordination to get back to what you're used to down there. The risk of harm to the mother is great in that first 6-8 weeks, why risk it? There are plenty of other safe ways to please your partner if that is your concern, and if it's you that you're concerned with, orgasms aren't the same after a baby for a while either. Give it time, enjoy the baby, and trust me, once things do get back to normal, it will be worth it!</td>

<td>Is it posible that my 2 month old is teething already?</td>

My friend's baby got her first tooth at 3 months. Find the lumps on the baby's gums that are somewhat solid, massage them with your finger or with a fingerbrush. Lots of chewy toys with a variety of textures, some rubber, some hard, some soft, some water filled, he/she may not know what to do with them yet but eventually will figure it out. 

When your baby is a little older, beef jerky is a good teether for baby. Get the real stuff, not slim jim, without extra flavorings or spices, just plain works. Watch baby for choking and don't give in small pieces but in somewhat large, thick chunks. When the meat is soaked through, you can get rid of it.</td>

That's really the only option right now... or possibly you can do all the getting up and nursing one night and then the next night he could go get the baby - change him/her and bring the baby to you in bed to feed it.  then when you're done - he can take the baby back and get him/her back and settled down again.  This trading off can work out if you don't want to pump.

Maybe combine things if you can stand the mess, like a pureed food with something to dip into it. Best before bathtime. Steamed but not mashed vegetables like carrots and potatoes, baby mashes in the mouth. You can do fruit slices the same way, slightly cooked and cooled.

Babies in America were routinely circumsized because it was believed that it decreased the amount of infection and cancer among males.  It has been since proven that with proper care and education on how to keep clean, this is an unneccesary medical procedure.

The cosmetic reason is the one you hear most often. "I want him to look like his dad" or "I don't want him to feel different than the other kids."</td>

<td>Should I let my infant daughter cry herself to sleep?</td>
<td>No, infants cry for a reason. It's their only way of communicating. When she's happy, you may want to start putting her in her crib to play, she may start putting herself to sleep that way. Babies and even children who cry themselves to sleep often can wake up irritable and confused, lonely, and feeling abandoned. Now in the toddler stage, temper tantrums should definitely be left to run themselves out as long as the child is not hurting themselves or others or causing physical damage. But right now, while baby is an infant, your comfort to her will mean more than anything. You can't spoil an infant, especially in the first year they learn that their needs are met and generally will be happy. Check to see why she's crying, she could be wet, dirty, hungry, need cuddling, sick, teething, gassy, or having a reaction to her food (what you ate if nursing, the type of formula if bottlefed). Have patience and give your baby the love she needs now. Rock her to sleep and put her down as soon as you can gently drop her arm and it drops without her letting it fall slowly. Babies have a different sleep cycle than us, they have light sleep, then deep sleep, then the mid sleep that they wake up from. She'll come to know soon enough that you're there for her when she needs you and it will make taking care of her needs as she gets older MUCH easier, and easier to comfort her. She'll learn she doesn't have to cry for at least 20 minutes before she's satisfied.

I forgot... if she's already asleep and wakes up crying, try letting her cry for a little bit before rushing right to her and she'll learn to get herself back to sleep. Sometimes they cry back to sleep quickly, but don't let it go on too long, I know how painful it can be to listen to it, I just did!</td>

<td>My baby girl poops once a day or less.is that normal?</td>
<td>Well it can be very normal. Was she just switched from breast to the bottle? My daughter is almost 8 months old and I had to switch her from breast to bottle early at 2 months. When we did the switch she completely stopped pooping for like a week. I was terrified so I asked her doctor. He told me that bottle- formula -fed babies may poop once a week. If it got to the point where she wasn't going at all to check back. He told me to just feed her like 2-4 ounces of pear juice or prune juice. I can tell you that the apple prune from Gerber was her favorite. Now that she is eating food her bowels are a little better. Sometimes she goes once a day. It will get better. Do try the Apple prune though. It is going to be so bitter that she hates it. Also Cereal can constipate them sometimes, but if you fed her that when she was breast feeding I wouldn't worry about that to much. I hope this helps.</td>

<td>Will there be cases when a child would not get the same blood type as that of any of his/her parents?</td>
<td>it is a possibility. as we know, there are 4 blood types. A, B, AB and O.  under these blood types, our genes contribute to the differences in blood types.  "alleles" dicate what blood type we will get from our parents. everyone has a pair of alleles, which when matched with another, we can determine the chances of getting a specific blood type.

Blood Type A can have AA(homozygous or pure), or AO (heterozygous)
B can have BB, or BO
AB has heterozygous AB only because the A and B allele are "co-dominant" and can exhibit themselves together
O can only be homozygous OO because it is a recessive blood type

if your parents for example, have blood type AO(dad) and BO(mom), you observe the chances of getting blood types using a "Pannet Square"

----A----O
B-AB-BO
O-AO-OO

this means, with parents who carry the recessive gene of O, while having Types A and B respectively, you have a 1 in 4 chance to get the other blood types as your own.  try changing the outer alleles to come up with different combinations of alleles, thus determining your possible blood types.

hope this helps</td>

<td>Can you cure a baby's colic by just swaddling and holding them tighter?  Do they just miss the womb?</td>
<td>There is a theorey about the 'fourth trimester'. The book/video Happiest Baby on the Block talsk about this.

While I feel its not ntirely true, I will say that newborns are very illequipped todeal with many stimuli. Swaddling does seem to calm many of them. I am concerned by yor use of the word 'tight'. Nothing to do with an infant should be super tight. They have a hard time breathing if wrapped too tightl.

But in many cases, swaddling will REDUCE the anxiety and fussiness associated with colic. It is NOT A CURE. Only TIME will cure this codition. By about 10 to 12 months it will resolve.

Colic is poorly understood. Some feel it is digestive in nature and many do get releife using baby antacids/gas relivers. Ask your doctor. Others find after the fact it was caused by food allergies the mom or baby have. Others feel it is an immature nervous system. Whatever the cause, it can be frustrating.

A darkened room, soothing music and gentle swaddling can help.

If you reach a breaking point, then swaddle your baby and put them down on their back in the crib and take a 15 minute breather.  Yes, they will cry. But it will not harm them. They will not remember, nor will it cause years of therapy or turn them into a serial killer. Sometimes it is just a good idea to let them have an chance to try to sooth themselves and give mom (or dad) a breather. 15 to 25 minutes then go back in and feed/etc.

Good luck.</td>

<td>Can I or someone else has too?</td>
<td>My son was in the NICU for 5 days for severe jaundice and his fluid intake had to be measured carefully. So he got pumped breastmilk for 3 of those days and didn't have any problems being confused between bottle and breast.

I made sure that he only got Nuk brand nipples (by gerber) because they are designed to be 'nursed' like a breast instead of sucked on, two completely different sets of muscle coordinations. Try both the silicone and the latex ones, my son preferred latex but each baby is different. You can ask for samples at hospital or the doctor may be able to get you some if you can't find it in the stores. The bottle never has really made a difference, the nipple has. He won't even take a bottle with a regular nipple. I also tried to make sure that when he got a bottle, it was his daddy or somebody else giving it to him, so that he would only want to nurse with me. And it worked. He wouldn't take a bottle from me except in the hospital for a while, he knew I had the fresh stuff on tap.

He's now 7 months old and very healthy, still breastfeeding and no formula or nipple confusion and we plan on nursing as long as he wants to! I think it's wonderful your commitment to breastfeeding your baby.</td>

<td>what is the best way to warm refrigerated breast milk?</td>
<td>Never microwave breast milk as it can break down the nutrients and can cause hot spots which can burn the baby.  You only need to place the bottle of milk in warm water for a few minutes....not boiling or hot.  It has to be about body temperature, just to take the chill out of the milk.  Your breasts produce milk that is body temp, so there is no need to boil or over heat milk.  If is is fresh, you can store it in the fridge for 5-7 days, if previously frozen it is good for 24 hours.  Breast milk can last 4-10 hours at room temperature, and less if it is really hot in the room.  Use your discretion</td>

<td>how do you stop your breasts from leaking milk?</td>
<td>Most women find that after several weeks to 2-3 months, leaking diminishes.  What to do depends on when you have the most trouble.  If you find that one breasts leaks when the baby feeds on the other, a good nursing bra with a nursing pad is the best way to deal.  If you are having trouble with leaking and are pumping at work, you may need to pump more often, or if that isn't possible, wait a week or two and you should have less leaking.  If you are leaking between feedings and the baby is not acting hungry, you may want to stop pumping if you are currently doing so.  Pumping is additional stimulation that tells the breast to make more milk.</td>

<td>is there a such of thing as a baby born with a extra cromisone(xxy)? how would this effect the child ?</td>
<td>There are certainly a number of congenital problems caused by the appearance of an extra chromosome.  Down Syndrome is one such disorder- patients have 3 copies of chromosome 21; it's also called Trisomy 21 for that reason.

The example you give, of a baby with an extra X chromosome in addition to the Y chromosome, is also well known.  Such a child might have no problems at all, and many who have this genetic makeup do not experience any problems.  But it can also result in what's called Klinefelter Syndrome.

Some symptoms that might affect an XXY male with Klinefelter Syndrome, if they do experience problems,  would be occasional breast enlargement, reduced hair, a round body type.  Also, they may have greater height and weight than the norm.  In addition, they can be affected by language development problems.</td>

<td>what is cause of irregular heart rhythm during after he has lung disease?</td>
<td>I can't directly answer your question, but I will strongly suggest you have your son checked out by a cardiac specialist.  The heart and lungs work together in lock step and issues with one can cause the other to have problems, too.

A cardiac specialist may suggest a few things: an Echocardiagram which is an ultrasound for the heart.  It is totally non-invasive (technician rubs a small wand on your son's chest for about 30 minutes) and is best done when you're son is relaxed or sleeping.  An EKG may be another option and is, like the procedure above, non-invasive.  The technician attaches a few sensor pads to your son's chest and stomach area and takes a few readings.  It's done in under 5 minutes.

Please don't be concerned or afraid of these procedures.  My daughter's had dozens of them and there no worse than getting your tonsils checked if you had a cold.  Best of luck - I'll be thinking about you both!</td>

<td>At what age will my baby sleep thru the night?</td>
<td>It's definitely true that it varies from baby to baby.  But there are things you can do to help them along.  Once your baby is over 10lbs, they don't physically need to eat during the night, but may continue to do so out of habit.  I breastfed my daughter for one year and she didn't sleep through until she was about 6.5 months.  I think I could have helped her sleep through sooner, but as a working mom, I needed as many direct feedings as possible to keep up the milk supply.  But if that is not an issue for you, you can start by not jumping right up at the first sound your baby makes.  Delay your response a few minutes, you might be surprised to find that your baby settles back down.  But the biggest key to helping this along is to make sure the baby is able to fall asleep on his own. Put him down for naps and at night when he is drowsy, but still awake and let him learn to fall asleep on his own. That way, if he wakes during the night, he has the ability to get back to sleep on his own.</td>

<td>Do babies have imaginations? If so what are they imagining?</td>
<td>I think they do. Bbaies are learning every second of everyday. Things are new to them, and it is our job to teach them what everything is. But since babies cant really understand what we are thinking, they 'imagine' things for themselves. My 4 month old loves to start at moving fans and lights, and even laughs about it sometimes. How infants and young children learn also depends on many features of the learning situation itself. Location, timing, prior experience, and post-learning activities can all influence how much is learned and how much is retained. There is a wealth of evidence that intelligence or infant competency is responsive to immediate and contextual cues, and that success or failure in one setting or on one day is not always a good indicator of what will happen in a different setting on a different day.

What infants are learning:

• Figuring out action-reaction and cause-and-effect relationships 
• Learning through observation 
• Copying others to learn new ways to do things 
• Tuning out what's irrelevant to focus on what's important 
• Distinguishing what's different and what's the same 
• Classical conditioning, especially involving reflexes in early infancy (like Pavlov's dog) 
• Trial and error 
• Conceptualizing ideas and themes 
• Verbal learning</td>

<td>Well, that probably depends on the level of colic.  If it is fairly mild or just during a certain part of the day, then you should look up the book "The Happiest Baby on the Block"--there are 5 or 6 techniques that are comforting and calming to babies.  However, if it is more severe colic, talk to your pediatrician.  My baby had very severe colic (crying for 3 hours straight in the evening and fussy most of the day--rarely went more than 10 minutes happy).  We knew that something was not right--she seemed to be so uncomfortable all the time and she strained so much trying to pass gas.  As it turns out something was wrong.  At 10 weeks old her pediatrician recommended a change to hypoallergenic formula which is easier to digest.  My baby's colic began to clear up immediately.  Thank goodness I had a pediatrician that validated my concerns and did not just say that she would outgrow colic.  So, it really depends on the severity of the colic and if you think that there may be an underlying problem.  It could just be that your baby is overstimulated and needs some calming and comforting.  If you think that there is something else going on--talk to your doctor!!</td>

<td>Why are SIDS organizations trying to hide the cause of SIDS?</td>
<td>Because currently many more deaths are attributed to SIDS than are truly SIDS. If they limited the diagnosis of SIDS to a specific bacteria, they would have to open all the cases of crib death or any time when a baby dies for a full autopsy and investigation into the parents. Perhaps that would be a good thing in some of the cases, but many times would lead to unneccessary trauma on an already grieving family.

SIDS has been credited for many infant deaths including suffocation whether accidental or intentional, re-breathing deaths (CO2 poisoning), unknown cause deaths, and probably many others not to exclude neglect cases.

Most parents do not understand the subtle medical differences between these deaths and it is easier for the medical field to just label any time a baby dies without obvious cause as SIDS to encourage parents to take better care of their children. 

As for a cover up, I haven't heard anything about one until now.</td>

<td>nippy puppy/baby?</td>
<td>No, remember puppies are babies too. I have 2 8 wks old puppies myself. They nip because it's play for them, they're also teething. Be sure to keep things around that they can chew on like toys, ropes, etc. Train them by saying "NO!!" in 
a loud voice. They get scared by just the tone of your voice so no reason to hit them. We had a 5 month old puppy when my 1st daughter was born. She never bit or nipped her because we always trained her not to do it with us, only with her toys. Purposely put your hand near or in your puppies mouth and then say "noooooo" when they nip you. If they dont stop right away do it again but louder each time. They get the hint pretty fast. Let your puppy smell your baby and say things like "be nice to baby" in a voice you would use with a baby. The puppy will recognize it as  member of the family and come to love him just like it loves you.

P.S. Obviously, until you properly train the puppy be careful with the baby. Keep an eye on it at all times so there is no chance for the baby to get hurt. I was just saying there's no reason to get rid of it just yet. The puppy deserves a chance to be trained, loved and be part of a family.</td>

<td>Does putting my baby in daycare 3 days a week affect her growth?</td>

From my experience my daughter is very well rounded for her age (10mos). She is either on schedule with what skills she should have or she has went beyond and developed the skills that normally take a little longer. 

I do make my daughter priority at night. My supper is normally delayed until she goes to bed unless it is something that I can share with her. Weekends are hers - very seldom do I leave her unless it is unavoidable.



Every child is different, you need to make sure that the daycare that you choose is a good fit for both you and your child and that your child is happy. Do you agree with their rules? Is it licensed? Is there an open door policy? - I would not take her anywhere that I needed an appointment to drop in and see her at lunch!! How are the other children - happy, sad, laughing? etc.</td>

<td>How do I relieve leg and ankle swelling after giving birth?</td>
<td>The first, and probably one of the best and most important, is to drink a lot of water. While it doesn't seem like it makes sense to get rid of fluids by taking in more, the extra fluids will help flush out your system of waste products which may have increased swelling. You really need at least 8 eight ounce glasses of water a day. The best tip I have for accomplishing this is to fill up a container to carry around and empty it by the end of the day.

Another dietary approach is salt. While many people believe that swelling is caused by excessive amounts of salt in the diet, the opposite is also true. Limiting the amount of salt you take in can cause swelling as well. As with all things, moderation is the key to balance.

Another new therapy is hydrotherapy or water. A new study out last fall suggests that even beyond the once told water immersion, water aerobics can help with swelling. Being in a pool of water helps the body shed the excess fluids through the kidneys, while supporting the pregnant uterus.

Here are some other basic tips to help reduce swelling and related discomforts:

    * Don't wear elastic topped socks or knee-hi pantyhose.
    * Wear comfortable shoes. Slip on types work best.
    * Put your feet up when possible.
    * If you stand at work, try to move around slightly or get a stool to prop a foot up.
    * Try support pantyhose.</td>

Your baby should start setting up a normal sleep pattern by 4 months so hang in there.

<td>If a child has has eaten, got some milk, is not hot, has no stomach problems.?</td>
<td>This is a highly debated question. There is no right or wrong answer and nothing has ever been proven that kids turn out better or worse.

I was always there for my son (now 15). Never let him cry himself to sleep. I tried it one time, he cried for 45 min. and when I went in he was shaking, red, sweaty. I picked him up and he fell alseep in less then 3 min. Now he is very independent, never gets in (major) trouble. A pretty good kid (for a teenager).

If you know your baby will fall asleep quick with you being near him, why make him suffer. The infant years leave so quick and before you know it he wont need you as much.</td>

<td>How do I stop using the breast pump?</td>
<td>See your doctor. They can give you meds to help dry up your milk. Also take lots of hot showers. Stand under the water and just relax. It helps the milk to "let down" and drain on its own. Your most likely going to get some engorgement.  (sorry for the bad spelling) A moist heating pad also helped me until the meds did their job. You can also help the blocked duct sometimes by feeling around a little bit for the lump thats more tender. (it helps to do this in the shower) Apply carefull pressure moveing toward the nipple. I don't know of any other way to say this, but carefully apply pressure on the nipple. It just might be the end of the duct that gets clogged. 
Please talk to your doctor. You don't have to keep going through this.

<td>When do babies hold their own bottle?</td>
<td>A lot of the other women are right... wanting your baby to hold their own bottle is more of a maternal desire for babies. If the baby can grasp and hold other things, there is no developmental delay. All babies progress at their own rate, so there is no set age, though some would like to tell you "they should be able to do *this* by *this age*" Yours is still very young, and is well on her way! My first son was three months old when he held his bottle for the first time all by himself. He occasionally held iton his own after that, but he didn't begin demanding to hold it himself until he was about 7 months. Babies want to be held, nurtured, and loved... holding their own bottle means they don't get *all* of that anymore, so often times, even if they CAN hold the bottle, they don't want to.
Unless she can't grip and hold other things, like toys, rattles, your finger... she's doing just fine. ;) 
If still have concerns, you should speak to her pediatrician about her development.</td>

<td>So what's the best name u would give ur baby boy/girl? And why?</td>

The names of  your children will come to you at odd times, such as in the middle of the night or even at the very second you see their beautiful faces just after being born.  My children's names are Aysha (Life) and Samuel(God hears).  Choose the name that work well with the personality of the family unit and of coures your last name.  You wouldn't want to name your child Stephen Stevens or if your last name is King you wouldn't want to give him a name such as Frederick Ulysses King, FUK.  Be aware of the possible jokes that come from a name or the initials of a name.  Choose wisely but use a name that toucehs your soul and bring you joy and a special meaning.  A name such as Autumn could remind you of the peacefulness of the season or Spring as a symbol of all things renewed.  What touches you the most and what is more important, how creative it is, it has a meaning, or it sounds well with the last name.  Most of all choose a name that you don't mind saying everyday of your life, for it will be forever.</td>

<td>what is the best brand of convertible car seat for a baby. As far as safety and quality. price does not matter</td>
<td>I have the Britax Marathon for my 16 month old son. He has been using it since he outgrew his car seat/carrier around 9 months. It goes from rear to forward facing as needed and is extremely safe. Britax is the industry leader in car seat safety. If you check out Consumer Reports, Britax is always rated the best for safety. They are extremely reliable and comfortable for the child. They are easy to use for parents, the only down side would be that they are bulky and heavy if you have to move them from one car to another frequently. They are more expensive than most other brands, but for me, the cost was worth knowing that my child would be safe. The Marathon is made for children up to 60 pounds, so we will not need to buy another car seat. It can be used for infants as small as 5 pounds also. Britax has a website, but does not sell direct to the public. You can buy them at Babies R Us and Target. I got mine through an internet promotion at Target and received free shipping and 10% off. So that helped with the cost some! I highly recommend Britax seats, as does Consumer Reports. Good luck in your shopping, I hope this has helped!</td>

<td>If it goes for several days or your baby is having difficulty straining you might want to try some dark brown sugar mixed in a bottle--that's what worked best for my baby (and what my pediatrician recommended).  I tried prune juice without results.  Also, you may want to pay attention to which formula your child is on--mine was on soy at the time and that was more of a problem than the iron.  Once taken off the soy, my baby's problem cleared up.  Of course, we switched her to hypoallergenic (nutramigen) because she had other issues too (excessive gas) and that tends to run through them pretty quick (let's just say that constipation is the absolute least of my worries).  Probably not a good idea to use corn syrup because it is not a sterile item--from what I understand it is the same issue as with honey and can be really dangerous for babies.  Ask your doctor what they would recommend and how much--I really can't even remember how much brown sugar I used.</td>

<td>How common is pertussis? My son was premature and his dr is waiting to give him his dtap shot .?</td>
<td>Pertussis may not be common, but it can be DEADLY in infants, especially premature infants.  Your doctor should never delay vaccinations in premature patients.  The only reasons to not give vaccines are usually an allergy to vaccine or a severe illness.  It's okay to give them to babies if they have a common cold. Even though your child's immune system may not be optimal, it is NEVER a reason to delay immunizations.

Your baby in particular needs the DTaP to protect against pertussis.  Pertussis can be a fatal disease, and once the whooping phase commenses, their is no specific treatment for pertussis, only supportive care.

DTaP is given at 2mo, 4mo, 6mo, 15-18mo, &amp; 4yrs.  Recent literature has supported the addition of a 6th booster at 11-12yrs - the same time that a tetanus booster is given.  This is because we still see a significant amount of pertussis in babies under 2 months of age.  They are being exposed to people who are not fully protected, and they may pass pertussis onto the baby.  Most pediatricians will begin this 6th booster this year.</td>

I've heard that a baby should not spend an entire night away from mom (or dad if he's the main care giver) until at least a year old, especially if nursing. Other people do overnights starting at 6 months old. There are psychological guidelines adopted by each state that spell it out in terms of hours even for true newborns. Check with a counselor or child advocate in your state to see what is accepted if this is a custody issue. Babies need their moms and dads, especially when brand new. I unfortunately had to leave my newborn overnight when he was just a few days old and in the NICU for jaundice, it was some of the most heartwrenching times for me not to be able to wake up and go check on him when I had to pump breastmilk for him.</td>

<td>My son is really congested....what can i give him to break it up?</td>
<td>If your baby is only 2 months old, the only safe medication is saline drops. You can put two or three drops in each nostril and then use a bulb syringe to suction the mucous out. Also try elevating one end of your baby's crib so that he won't be laying flat when he sleeps. Make sure to put a pillow or blanket UNDER the mattress, not in the bed with your child. You can try a cool mist humidifier in the room if the vaporizer is not working. They are better for children because they do not breed bacteria like the warm mist humidifiers and vaporizers do. Unfortunately, your son is too young to take any decongestants. They are not supposed to take Pediacare until they are three months old and even then, it doesn't work very well. You may also try taking him into a bathroom that is filled with steam from a hot shower. This sometimes helps break up mucous in the chest and that combined with the saline drops and bulb syringe should help clear out some of the congestion. It should clear up in the next couple of weeks, if it does not, go back to your doctor and have him checked again to be sure he has not developed bronchitis or pneumonia.

Note: To the person who suggested giving the baby honey, DO NOT EVER give a baby HONEY!! It carries the toxin for botulism and should NEVER be given to a child under 1 year of age. It may not happen, but it has the potential to make a child VERY sick. Ask any doctor (at least one who knows what they are talking about) and they will tell you a child under one should never have honey.</td>

Believe me, I know from experience, two year olds are more manageable around a newborn than an 5, 6, 7, 8 year old.  They are to independent and actually are more jealous of the baby, especially if you let someone hold the baby and not them.  So my best advice to you is to let your two year olds be near the baby, tell them that the baby is very delicate and you have to be very nice to the baby.  Tell them to be quiet when the baby is sleeping if they get too loud.  Soon you will be laughing because everytime someone makes a sound near the baby, they will make the shushing sound.  Believe me, just have your two year olds know that you need to spend extra time with the new baby because he/she needs a lot of you love and attention right now, just like you did for them when they were this little.  Things will be okay, I promise.</td>

<td>any tips on brestfeeding a baby with teeth?</td>
<td>Keep on going. My son has 3 front teeth and rarely bites, usually only if he's startled and pulls off without unlatching first. The best thing is to make sure that if and when she bites you, you say "ouch" or "no" or "no biting" very loudly and sternly and take the nipple away from her. she'll cry the first few times, but after she's settled explain that if she bites, she loses the breast. It may not seem like she understands you, but she does. Then let her start nursing again once she's calm. If it's a bad bite, you may want to go to the other breast for that feeding, but don't skip the bitten breast completely, as you could get engorged or breast infection or thrush etc. 

I've also heard but haven't tried it out that babies who bite frequently while nursing are experiencing gum pain and to try some hylands teething tablets or a little bit of tylenol before feedings to numb the pain. I would hesitate on the tylenol except before bed but it's a suggestion you can ask your pediatrician if it becomes a problem.

Good luck and way to go on your commitment to keep nursing your baby!</td>

<td>I just started breastfeeding.There are lumps in my breast, is this normal?Also have swelling.What do I do?</td>
<td>Lumps may be felt at the beginning of breast feeding. However, there may be some other problems too.

The best way to decide whether to be alarmed or not is to maintain a chart three / four times a day - with respect to whether the size of the lumps is increasing / decreasing before / after the breast feeding, and over the course of a few days too (as some lumps increase during menstruation periods).

Also, the best way to feel for the lumps is with the FLAT of your hand. If you are feeling with the ends / tips of your fingers then you may find lumps in normal women too.

If the LUMPS remain stationary / keep on increasing in size - GO TO A DOC...</td>

<td>How do you get babies to stop cryin?</td>
<td>Caring for a baby is a demanding job. But caring for a baby who won't stop crying can really test your limits.

Two things right up front:

1) Do not give a baby any kind of medication unless it has been approved by the baby's doctor first.

2) Do not put a baby in a baby swing until he is able to lift and hold his head up by himself or he may injure his neck or head.

You didn't mention whether you had checked to see if the baby has diaper rash. This can be extremely irritating! If this is an issue, buy some good diaper rash creme and apply it generously to the affected area every time you change a diaper until the rash is gone.

Also pay attention next time you feed the baby. Is he swallowing a lot of air from the bottle? See if you can tilt the bottle differently so there isn't air near the nipple. You might also want to try burping the baby several times after he feeds. Maybe one burp isn't enough to get all the air out.

Okay, now for some good techniques to try.

Start with swaddling. Swaddling is where you wrap the baby snuggly (but not too tightly) with a baby blanket. Babies find this quite comforting! Read how to do it properly at BabyCenter.com. (Exact link is given in Sources, below.)

Maybe this is an obvious one, but you can try giving the baby a pacifier. We used the Nuk brand with our kids. Make sure you get the right size for the baby's age, and always keep it clean.

We discovered by accident that vacuum cleaner noise caused our baby to get quiet. Many other parents have also reported that this helps. You could even record the sound so you don't have to run the vacuum so much.

I have friends who used the washing machine or dryer as well. Just set the baby on the machine while it's on, but be careful that it doesn't get too hot. And never, never leave the baby alone on the machine, even for a second.

Here's something you may never have heard about, but it has been used very successfully. I once transcribed a book for a doctor on using music therapy with colicky babies. Here's what you do.

Get some nice music (babies really seem to love Charlotte Church's music!) and a kitchen timer. When the baby won't stop crying, put him in his crib and close the bedroom door just to where you can peek in if you feel you need to check on him. Don't let him see you after you leave the room. Go sit in the living room with your timer set to something like 5 minutes. Take some deep breaths and try to relax.

The baby may continue to cry, but that's okay if he's safe in his crib. Just let him cry for a few minutes. If he doesn't stop crying after 5 minutes, go check on him. Keep your interaction with him minimal (no talking, no playing). Just check to be sure he's okay. Then leave the room and try for 5 more minutes.

Here's the good part: If he stops crying, immediately turn the music on loud enough so he can hear it. (You may want to have the tape or CD player near the bedroom door.) Leave the music on and walk into the room and over to the baby. Talk to him, play with him, or pick him up. Give him some gentle attention.

If he starts crying again, put the baby back in the crib, leave the room, and turn the music off. When he stops crying, immediately turn on the music, go back in the room and give him attention.

Basically what this does is train the baby to associate his quietness with lovely music and your attention. Likewise, he will associate crying with no music and no attention.

You may need to try this quite a few times before it begins to work. You probably won't want to do this too many times in a row because it can be rather stressful for the baby. If you've tried 3 times in a row, then take a little break from it and try it again later.

One note: Always be sure there is nothing wrong with the baby and that his basic needs are met before you use this technique.

<td>Hiccups are nothing to worry about. All of us gets them at times. There is nothing we can do to prevent them I can tell you what some people say works though. First let me tell you what causes them.

The contraction of the diaphgram is what is the problem. This is the organ that helps us to breathe. It pulls down when we inhale and pulls up when we exhale. It gets irritated at times and pulls up with a jerky movement bringing out the sound we termed hiccups. 

This occurs when large a swallow is taken at one time or a big mouthful of fluid or food.

Things that work:
(i) putting a little sugar under the tongue
(ii) drinknig some fluids or water

<td>Why do infants spit and suck their hands?</td>
<td>Yeah, babies normally drool.  They haven't figured out how to swallow their spit yet.

Sucking the fist could be comforting or it could feel good to her.  Almost all babies do it.  

The drooling and finger chewing and sucking gets more extreme when first teething.  She's kinda young, but it's not impossible for her to be teething.  She'll probably do this for months and months.  Just put a bib on her to keep her clothes dry.  

The only time you should worry is if she sucks blisters on her fingers or they start to become pruny all the time.  That probably won't happen; she'll know when to give it a rest.

<td>how do I get my baby to sleep through the night?</td>
<td>Here is what worked for me, using "him" because my last one was a boy. 

It really does depend on the age of the child, my daughter didn't really sleep through until she was over a year.  I made a lot of mistakes (rocking her to sleep and being a little less aware/non-believing about routines being important to babies.)  with her.  My son was exclusively breastfed until 5-6 months when I started him on cereal (in a bowl with a spoon)  and he slept through the night at 9 weeks)

Focus more on the day than the night.  Try keeping him awake more during the day with a routine of activities and regular feedings, and naps depending on age Have a bedtime ritual (bath, sleeper, cereal (if he is at least 4 months-and spoon feed- never in a bottle!) book, song, bed- whatever you think-it doesn't have to be elaborate) and keep it consistent. At night- keep the room dark, and do not interact with him. Try letting him cry a little, go in and rub his back if he doesn't settle and let him know you are there, but no talking and do not pick him up. You can also try sitting there where he can see you but not picking him up, it's sleeping time. He needs to learn to comfort himself and of course you don't want to just let him cry.

Good luck- and welcome to the land of insomnia!  My 2 yr old has just started having night terrors and waking me up regularly again.</td>

<td>Your opinion on public breastfeeding?</td>
<td>1) I think mothers should be free to feed their children anywhere, at any time, in any manner that works for them.
2) Pacific NW, USA
3) Mid-Twenties
4) I have a 8 month old son who has been exclusively breastfed since he was born. The convenience and economical benefits of breastfeeding are HUGE for me. I can run out the door with nothing but a diaper and be set for the day... his food is always "on tap", the right temp, premixed &amp; sterilized with no effort on my part whatsoever. Breastfeeding in public is not a big deal for me at all. In all honesty, I don't think people can even tell what I am doing 95% of the time. I've breastfed at the grocery store, on an airplane, during a wedding, at the nail salon, during church... the list goes on. Nobody has ever made a rude comment or even given me a dirty look. Alot of whack jobs out there compare nursing in public with urinating in public, which is completely inane. Nursing can't be compared to anything else but EATING. You wouldn't let someone make you eat your lunch sitting on a toilet seat would you? So why should a baby?</td>

The expense is too great and the results too small. The actual chances of your child having a disease or disorder that could be treated with cord blood are small. Banking it for yourself is costly, $1500-2000 to start and annual fees around $200-$500. Read what Dr. Michael Cohen has to say about it in "The New Basics" A guide for modern parents. He is really down to earth about it! But enough about why you shouldn't, if you do - I understand from personal research that ViaCord has the best rating. P.S. - if you decide not to store for yourself, you can dontate to a blood bank. Check with your hospital to see if they do that. Good luck!</td>

If he throws his little head and feet back and then brings them tight into his chest He has Colic.
 Here's what we did when we worked nursery at the hospital.
1. Warm a blanket (old swaddling blanket folded in a small square) clean out microwave and heat blanket 10 seconds or less watch that it doesn't get to hot. Then place warmed square on Baby then Swaddle baby and place on your knee patting babies back they pass gas and sometimes poop then no colic.
If for some reason that does not work Retract baby legs back and then take a small glass thermometer  (((((barley)))) inserting the tip in the baby rectum with lots of KY jelly or Vaseline move (((barley in a circler motion)))  The baby will have a huge poop thus no more Colic.

<td>how do nicotine effect the baby?</td>
<td>When smokers breath in smoke they draw nicotine into their lungs. The nicotine is then able to enter the bloodstream and other parts of the body. If a woman is pregnant, the nicotine is able to reach the fetus by crossing the placenta and circulating into the baby's blood. Due to the reduction of oxygen and nutrients supplying the fetal tissues, the effects of nicotine can be seen in every trimester from spontaneous abortions in the first trimester to premature delivery, malformations and decreased birth weight in the third (Blair et al. 1996). Although the effects of nicotine are not the same for every organism, most exhibit some retardation of embryonic growth when exposed.

Studies of marijuana in pregnancy are inconclusive since many women who smoke marijuana also use tobacco and alcohol. Smoking marijuana increases the levels of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the blood, which reduces the oxygen supply to the baby. Smoking marijuana during pregnancy can increase the chance of miscarriage, low birth-weight, premature births, developmental delays, behavioral and learning problems. 

According to the Organization of Teratology Information Services (OTIS), during the early months of pregnancy cocaine exposure may increase the risk of miscarriage. Later in pregnancy, cocaine use can cause placental abruption. Placental abruption can lead to severe bleeding, preterm birth, and fetal death. OTIS also states that the risk of a birth defect appears to be greater when the mother has used cocaine frequently during pregnancy. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology (ACOG), women who use cocaine during their pregnancy have a 25 % increased chance of premature labor. Babies born to mothers who use cocaine throughout their pregnancy may also have a smaller head and their growth hindered. Babies who are exposed to cocaine later in pregnancy may be born dependent and suffer from withdrawal symptoms such as tremors, sleeplessness, muscle spasms, and difficulties feeding. Some experts believe that learning difficulties may result as the child gets older. Defects of the genitals, kidneys, and brain are also possibilities.</td>

<td>What do i need to know about newborns?</td>
<td>There is so much to learn but the most important thing is to relax.  If your tense the baby will pick up on it and become upset too.  Here's some things to know...
1. Newborns cry alot, no they're not trying to drive you crazy, it usually means that they are hungry, tired or wet. It may be hard to beleive in the begining but you will learn which cry means what.

2. Newborns show that they are hungry by thrusting their tongue out. If you can catch that sign, you can avoid the crying later on.

3. They go through about 8 to 10 diapers a day.  The stool can be yellow to green depending if the baby is breastfed or formula fed.

4. Swaddling the baby and holding it close and speaking in a soothing voice can help calm the baby.

5. Most important.... don't be afraid to ask for help or accept it.  The first six weeks are very tough and a half hour to take a bath by yourself can be a godsend.

6. Get in touch with WIC, and your local hospital to find out about parenting classes.

<td>whats the best way to get the baby to sleep through the night?</td>
<td>there is no best way because every baby is different. My first one sleep through the night at about 1 month age. After I fed her about 12(midnight) and she would sleep until the next morning 7am. Now, with my second one, she is 3M old and she just started to sleep through the night after I fed her at about 10pm, she would wake up at 6am the next morning. 

If they cries, approach them and see if they are alright, sometimes they just need diaper change. Sometimes if they have bad dreams or whatever reason, I will pick them up and hold them tight for a few minutes, put them back to the crib. 

I believe sometimes they will sleep better if they have some exercise, even a little baby. I do that each day, and I will sleep better too.</td>

<td>My niece just had a baby and it was born she was born without a roof in her mouth.?</td>
<td>cleft palate is not uncommon, and the hospital should have speech/language pathologists who specialize in infant feeding to assess the problem and recommend techniques and devices to help the baby eat.  Also, the hospital should have a craniofacial team (or at least refer you to one nearby) that will evaluate the baby's case and monitor the child through surgeries and as he/she grows.

If your niece was planning to breastfeed, she will probably have to pump the milk, and the hospital should be able to get her a good pump, either through her insurance, since the baby has a condition, or on a rental basis.  Breastmilk will help the baby's immune system and is easier to digest.  

Some people need surgeries throughout their lives, as they grow, and also may need speech therapy to help them learn to speak clearly.  In addition, children with cleft palate are also at a higher risk for middle ear infections (otitis media) because the fluid they're drinking can get up into the middle ear space, since the palate is not able to block the Eustacian tubes.  Again, the feeding specialist should be aware of this and advise the mother on correct positioning of the baby when feeding. 

If the lip is also cleft, the plastic surgery techniques available now have really reduced the effects of scarring.  There are a lot of resources and support groups available, so your niece and the rest of the family can be well-educated on the issue, and it should help put your minds at ease.</td>

<td>How far apart did everyone of 2 or more kids space them?</td>
<td>Between child 1 and 2 there are 2.5 years. Between child 2 and 3 as well as child 3 and 4 there are 4 years.

As far as what I would recommend, I think you should look at the length of time you wish to be bearing children. If you are anxious to be getting back into the workforce, have them closely spaced. If you enjoy being an at home mom and there is not money pressure to get back into outside of the home employement, spread them out a bit. You won't wear yourself out as much.

It is easier to meet a baby through preschooler's need when the other children are older without feeling like the older kids get sidelined. The older ones have enough independence that they can typically help themselves to what they need instead of waiting for you to be done with the younger one.

As far as how spacing impacts sibling socialization, I have found that personality is the strongest deciding factor. Though, the kids more closely spaced did have more play activities that they enjoyed in common than the more widely spaced children did. With greater spacing the older kids have enough maturity that they deal with toddlers and preschoolers with less frustration. They are more capable of imitating adult behavior: distract the baby, wait until the baby is done before taking the toy, etc).</td>

You might also talk with the doctor about using Airborne -- I take it whenever I think I'm getting sick and it makes me feel tons better.  I think it's safe for kids, but I'd check to be sure.  You should also talk to the day care center about how often he's been sick.  Kids in day care do get sick alot, but it doesn't hurt to make sure they are washing their hands between diaper changes, before feeding the kids, etc and making sure the kids are washing their hands too.  Also, ask how often they disinfect the toys -- it should be done at least once a week for toddlers (more often for infants).</td>

Try to have your baby sit up in your arms as he eats.  Burp him well and keep him sitting for 30 minutes after he eats.  Try rubbing his tummy often and burping him whenever you pick him up, whether he has eaten recently or not.  Babies also swallow air when they cry, so for now don't let him get too upset for too long.  Gas relief drops are also lifesavers.

<td>What is the best gift for a new baby?</td>
<td>Well, if you really want to invest in the new little one I would say ask the parents what that one special thing is that they would really like.  If you want it to be something practical tell them that parameter otherwise ask them what their greatest wish is and then see if you can fulfill it.

Kind of a silly thing, but just go to the store and pick out all the cute little things "you" really like then pack them up in a cute little hamper or something.  Clothes, diapers, bottles, blankets, etc.

It should be as fun for you to shop as well!

Something kind of geeky and really unfun, but practical- start an education savings account or savings bonds.  The parents will thank you later and so will the little one when it's time to start college.

If they don't have one already, maybe a good quality digital camera. That will come in handy for many years.</td>

Kids don't typically learn to blow their noses on their own till age three or so. Hope this helped!</td>

<td>If you have already been told your child had this condition there really is nothing you can do but wait it out. There is nothing the doctors can do or give them while in the whomb. 

If you seek more information you can always go to the doctor who determined this in the first place and ask all the question you need to. You can also advise on some support groups for parents dealing with this. You might develope a bond with other parents that will be helpful while raising your child.

Advice:  Make an emergency bag and throw it in the trunk of your car.  I filled up a backpack with water, individual formula packets, a couple bottles, diapers, wipes, a roll of paper towels (trust me, it comes in handy) extra clothes, sunscreen, snacks, ect.  Unless you have a diaper bag the size of a shopping cart, you just can't carry everything around.  My advice, take a small diaper bag with just the essentials and have the other bag for backup.  Afterall, you will forget things from time to time.</td>

(For some reason yahoo answers isn't taking the link... go to: http://www.amazon.com and do a seach for Zippy Stroller Inglesina)

It's been rated the "best buy" for parents.  It is functional, multi purpose, and you can fold it up with one hand.  The best part is that it is only only 17 pounds.  It can hold an infant seat and toddler.  The models that you see that are a travel system comes with a stroller that is pretty heavy (the car seat/stroller ones).  It even has a cup holder.  It is also safe.

You can read reviews from the link above from people who bought it from www.amazon.com  It comes in several different colors!</td>

<td>What kind of "new" games can I play with my 7 month old baby?</td>
<td>I have a 7 month old too, he's so much fun. Right now he loves peekaboo. Not just me covering my face, but hiding behind a doorway or wall or something that he can try to look around to find me and I jump out. Musical toys for babies are really good at this age because they've connected cause and effect and will hit things repeatedly to see what happens. My son also likes to try to crawl (he's just barely learning) and so I'll place things around him and encourage him to go after them. He's getting really good at that. Pushups are fun, both varieties. One is where you lay down and "push up" baby so that he's flying or you put him on your legs lifted in the air and do leg lifts. Great excercise for you too. Or baby pushups, where I lay him on his stomach and I lay on my stomach too and I go "up" and "down" and say which way I'm going and get him to mimic me. He's surprisingly good at it and loves it.

They also are fascinated by mirrors now, so if you have a baby safe one for him to play with or one mounted to a wall (like in a hallway) let him explore the world with the "other baby". Just play around with it. The more you stimulate his senses now, the more imaginative he will be and the less dependent he will become on TV and other hypnotic forms of entertainment.</td>

A year later she carried her ideas further. Using disposable absorbent material and combining it with her Boater design, Marion Donovan created the first convenient disposable diaper. Manufacturers thought her product would be too expansive to produce. Marion Donovan, left unable to sell or license her diaper patent, went into business for herself.

<td>It depends on the medication.  Often, doctors don't know a lot about the safety of medications during lactation.  Ask your doctor to get ahold of a book called "Medications and Mother's Milk" by Dr. Thomas Hale.  That will give you and your doctor an idea of the safety of a specific medication.  Then you can make decisions regarding the overall necessity of the medication versus the benefits of breastfeeding.  Perhaps you could wean off the meds for a few weeks or months (the early weeks, when the baby is smallest, are when meds tend to have the greatest effect) until your baby is bigger and better able to tolerate the medication.  You can also check www.kellymom.com for a list of some common medications and their safety during lactation.</td>

I think one of the most important things to consider when picking a baby's name is to remember the nicknames that it can be made into.  Almost everyone shortens a long name, so if you don't like "lou" for a girl then louise may not be the best choices.  Also think of the mean nicknames &amp; everything it could rhyme with.  I personally like names that you can change in several different ways so that the kid can pick which version they want to use.  Like Elizabeth, could be Elli, Beth, Betty, Liz, Lizzi, Liza, Izzy, etc.  That way the name can match the personality, there is a big difference in the way we think of a Beth and a Liza.</td>

Introduce one new food every three to four days, observing for any allergic reactions.
Here's something I finally figured out because no one could tell me; the only difference between stage one and stage two foods is size of jar and variety. Stage ones are single ingrediant and good for checking for allergies.

If it still concerns you, pump your milk and put it in a bottle for one feeding.  A two week old baby should be eating 4 oz of breastmilk every three hours or so.  Wait 2 hours after feeding your baby, and if you can pump 4 ozs, you have enough milk.

<td>Why does Breastfeeding make me almost fall asleep every time while feeding?</td>
<td>Ugh, I remember that. :D (I have two sons, one of which is 3 months, so this was NOT long ago for me too!)

This is NORMAL and it is NOT something you need to give up breastfeeding for... whoever suggested switching to the bottle because of this was giving BAD ADVICE. This will pass, and even those who bottle feed get tired too, just for different reasons.

For the first two weeks or so, breastfeeding can make you sleepy because of hormones (oxytocin) that are released when the baby feeds. This is the same hormone that causes your uterus to contract back to it's normal size and let's down the milk. These are two things that your body hasn't done before (or for a long time, if you've had children prior to this one), so it is exhausting and tiring, and can quiet literally put you to SLEEP! Usually the tired feeling only lasts a few weeks because your body eventually gets used to the hormone and it's effects.
It's always best to be awake during feedings, but sometimes feeding while lying down is the best way to go to prevent something dangerous from happening, and that way you and the baby can both rest, too.
Here are some suggestions to try and stay awake during feedings:
Munch on crackers
Listen to music
Sip a cold drink
Have someone talk to you

Again, if you still have concerns, talk to your lactation consultant or a la leche league rep!

If you want to give an organic type of food, fruits and some vegtables are fine, but you need to do the research to see what is ok for you child based on age.  And do not over stimulate the kid with food too quickly.  Again, you need to watch out for alergies, that can take up to 72 hours to manifest.

I have read that breast milk provides everything babies need to drink for the first year or perhaps even longer? The World Health Organisation recommends breastfeeding for a minimum of 2 years.</td>

BTW when you're baby gets a little older and is ready you could try grating carrots instead of cooking them.  Don't shred, grate.  My daughter loved it!</td>

When I was pregnant, I would always pay attention to movie credits, and see which names caught my eye.</td>

<td>Most useful and well liked Baby Toys and Equiptment?</td>
<td>-I loved the Snugli carrier- we also used a sling.
-nursing clothes by Motherwear (check ebay for deals) are great for nursing in public if you plan to.  Lansinoh breast pads were the best.     
-I can say with confidence that I will never buy a highchair again- I would save the money and get the $14 Walmart one that straps to a chair- it's just as good!
-For a stroller, definitely pick one that you can open and close with one hand.  Anything else is too much of a pain- especially if you fly. 
-Happy Baby manual food grinder- you can take it anywhere and just grind up your healthy family dinner for baby. 
-My son's fave toy was the Ball Blaster, the balls swirl down and come out the bottom. 
-car seat- definitely the Britax Roundabout- it's a little more pricey but the easiest one I have ever used.  For an infant seat I liked the Stay In View by Fisher Price but they stopped making it and it would be hard to find new now. (I had a hard time 3 yrs ago w. my youngest!)  I liked the carry strap. 
-I have a First Years vinyl changing pad that has pockets for a couple diapers and travel wipes- it was great.
-I would suggest a backpack instead of a diaper bag, it's just so much easier!  If you don't bottle feed, they really don't need much space- I have thrown the changer (above) and a couple toys into my purse and been fine. 

My ultimate advice- babies need far less crap than you think. With each child my list of "things needed for baby" just gets smaller and smaller. 

Congrats!</td>

Removing this small piece has benefits though. Mainly hygeine is easier and many spouses prefer the look of it. Their are religious reasons also, but I'm not going into that. The actual operation can be at anytime in a man's life however most males will have it done to them as newborns. It is a very simple procedure that takes just a minute to do.</td>

We've been in the same routine at bed time for a long time, we just dont nurse all night long now.  i know its going to be hard, was for us, but in the long run it will first and foremost be better for your daughter and then yourself to get that uninterrupted sleep through the night.  but as soon as my daughter wakes up she knows exactely what she wants.  so that will be our next challenge.  good luck to you in whatever you do!</td>

<td>I used the head support with both of my children until they out grew them. It was the only way to keep them comfortable. The blankets would always bunch up. We never had problems with the supports you buy at Wal Mart. We had to buy the smallest one you could find. Now they have where you get 2or3 inside each other, which is great. When your baby is first born you will probably need a smaller one, so he or she can't move their head about. As long as the baby's head is unable to turn about there should be no risk of suffocation. As  for the thing with hospital we never had no problems. I would contact the hospital/birthing center you intend on going to and ask them that is the only way you will know the truth. If you still can't decide contact the baby doctor you have chosen and see what he/she feels is best. GOOD LUCK AND CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!</td>

Infants born with SB sometimes have an open lesion on their spine where significant damage to the nerves and spinal cord has occurred. Although the spinal opening can be surgically repaired shortly after birth, the nerve damage is permanent, resulting in varying degrees of paralysis of the lower limbs. Even when there is no lesion present there may be improperly formed or missing vertebrae and accompanying nerve damage. In addition to physical and mobility difficulties, most individuals have some form of learning disability.</td>

Make sure that the baby-2-be's room is safe....no hanging cords, clean, and easy to get to. Try not to spary anything with strong odors where the baby will be. I understand how this can be difficult, but after a few eeks of the baby being born, you will start to feel more comfortable and confident.</td>

<td>under what temp. should a new born be kept.?</td>
<td>Newborns don't have the proper ability to maintain a good body temperature like adults do so the best thing you can do is to layer your baby's clothing in one more layer than what you would be wearing. 
You can tell what a good body temperature for a baby is by looking at their skin. If it's bright red, or rosey, and they are warm to the touch, they're too warm. If their skin looks like 'cottage cheese' with a purple tint, and feels cool to the touch, they are too cold and need to be bundled.
You can also ask your pediatrician to write down what your baby's body temperature should be when taken with a thermometer. That way if they do not warm up or cool down after removing or adding clothing and blankets, you can take their temperature. All thermometers are different, so read the manual to make sure you know what a normal reading would be on yours. Good luck!</td>

It is probably best to wait at least 6 months, until you fill emotionally and physically on really good form again before trying, and make sure that your iron stores are up and you''re taking folic acid."</td>

<td>how to take care for a premature baby?</td>
<td>Consider talking with your child's pediatrician for specific advice concerning your child's overall needs and care.  

All preemies are individuals, amd many factors are involved in how well he will do, especially how mature his organs are and whether he has other medical problems, such as infections, birth defects, etc. It is important to keep in mind that almost two thirds of those that survive will either be normal or have only mild or moderate medical problems.

The more mature your baby is at birth, the more likely it is that he will not have any problems, so that babies born at 26-29 weeks have a much better chance of surviving and growing up either normal or with mild or moderate problems.  Babies born at 30-33 weeks usually do even better, and have a very high rate of survival. After 34 weeks, babies are usually only mildly immature and usually do very well.

<td>can you spoil a baby by holding it alot?</td>
<td>Some people believe that comforting a crying baby will just encourage her to cry more. This is a myth – babies cry for a reason! A baby cannot feed herself or calm herself when she is hungry or in pain. Her cries are signals that she needs help. You cannot spoil your infant by meeting these needs. In fact, prompt attention to their needs gives babies confidence that their world is safe and predictable. Many people are surprised to learn that babies whose parents respond promptly to their cries actually cry less than other babies.</td>

Maybe you could nurse her earlier and play with her until she is tired so she will stop associating sleeping with nursing.  As much as I hate to say this, a pacifier may be a good TEMPORARY thing.  I despise seeing children with those things in their mouths when they are walking around.  Do you have a rocking chair?  You might try rocking her if you don't already.  Music may help too.  Ask your peditrician for some advice, or ask a pediatric nurse at your local hospital.  There may be someone at the health department too.  If nothing else they could give you a lead.

<td>my 9month old girl gets up two times a night?</td>

She may just not know how to put herself back to sleep or she just may have figured out what to do when she wants your company in the middle of the night.  It's hard to let a baby cry (having just gone through sleep training myself), but in the end you are usually doing them a big favor by teaching them how to go back to sleep on their own because they need the sleep.  My 5 month old went from waking 4-5 times a night to not at all within 3 weeks when we started letting her cry (we would go in and comfort her every 5-10 minutes if she continued to cry).  She is so much calmer and happier during the day now that she is getting uninterupted sleep at night (she sleeps from 8:30pm-7am).  Talk to your baby's doctor for an opinion specifically about your daughter (since all babies are different).  Good luck.</td>

As far as rights go--hopefully, you're on good terms with the father, and you can work out a good arrangement for visitation, etc., between the two of you.  Technically under the law (in the US) an unmarried father has the same rights as a married one.  If the father wants greater custody or time with his child than you want to give him, he can, after proving paternity, request custody, partial custody, or visitation for his child through the courts.   

(Apparently in Britain, unmarried fathers have practically no rights:  I've found a lot of web pages like this:

<td>Life with little ones is HARD, don't beat yourself up over feeling overwhelmed, it's normal.

Do you have any other new dads in your life you can talk to?  Sometimes a burden shared is a burden lifted.

I agree that having an interest outside the home is healthy, but make sure you're allowing your wife her free time as well, especially if she's home with the baby all week.

As children grow, they get easier to entertain.  Just keep reminding yourself, "This too shall pass."

Good Luck!</td>

<td>does breastfeeding make your breast saggy?</td>
<td>I would say it has more to do with the number of pregnancy's you've had, your age, and weather or not your are overweight or were overweight, and the size of your breasts - larger breasts may sag more because of gravity!  Mine are saggy and I did breastfeed but I also have two kids, not going to say my age, and was overweight and lost some of the weight.  Being pregnant itself changes the shape of everything and you can get back to pretty close to what you were before but nothing will go back to the exact same.  

Even if breastfeeding did cause saggy breasts the benefits to breastfeeding for you and your baby far outweigh the cons to having saggy breasts.</td>

Show her that you also have the best intentions and you do want to help out in taking care of your baby together. TEAMWORK! After all, having a baby can stress a whole family.

It is not for sure if it will last 10 or 20 years, etc. So I chose to forget about cord blood banking and let my baby pump in all those stem cells that would normally go to waste. If the umbilical cord is not cut, the baby keeps receiving all those stem cells that he/she probably needs. Once the umbilical cord stops pumping, THEN they cut the cord. 

In any case, I hope you make the best decision for you and your baby :o)</td>

<td>Babies can burp on their own...but it takes a long time and a lot of pain if you leave it up to them. Toots seem easier because they are actually burpies that didn't make it as burpies...the trapped gas that you need to help babies with is very painful, and it stops around 3-4months of age. If you don't get all of the burpies up (and it's very hard to tell how many are in there!) then some make their way down to the bum, which doesn't hurt as much.
Dance gently with her, hold her in an airplane position, your hand under her belly will help press some of the gas out. Kolic (gripe) water also helps with the pain, and so does Ovol.</td>

<td>It depends on your child's day-to-day activity. Bathing is really necessary only to clean your child off when she gets dirty. That could range from several times in one day, if she makes mud pies or plays in a muddy stream, to once every three or four days, if she spends her time playing house and reading. Most active children could benefit from a bath every few days. If twice a week is still more than your child can handle, wipe her off with a damp washcloth, or take her for a swim in a pool or a lake. This will get her almost as clean as a bath, without any of the fighting.</td>

<td>what is the best solid food to give to a baby when starting solids?</td>
<td>Typically when you start a baby on solids, you begin with the baby cereals, first rice, then oatmeal,  and then adding the others in. you only begin with one at a time. the purpose is to determine food allergies. the most bland food to begin with is the rice cereal. once you make it through trying out the cereals, you begin to add in the pureed fruits, typically applesauce first, bananas, etc. Adding the foods, one at a time at given intervals (counted in days) gives you a chance to see if the baby has any allergic reactions. once you've added cereals, and fruits to the diet, you can start in with the vegetables. there is a timing schedule for this, and your pediatrician usually gives you a food schedule. Cereal also has a filling effect, so typically when you start the baby with cereal, it fills their tummy more than just milk, and satiates them better, giving them a full tummy to sleep on.</td>

<td>Normal birth?  Depends on who you ask.

Hospital births follow a certain set of guidelines that aren't really "normal", but because 95% of babies in the US are born inside a hospital setting, they are the most "common" births today.

For information on "Hospital normal", take a childbirth class offered at a local hospital.

For TRUE normal, natural, unadulterated birth information, check out the birth stories on the sites below.

<td>my baby haven't had a good nite sleep for almost 2 weeks now. i'm desprate...?</td>
<td>Depending on how old your baby is, teething might be the culprit. My son started the teething process at about 2 months old but didn't cut a tooth until 6 months old. There are lots of other reasons, perhaps you are stressed and the baby is tuning in to it. It could also be allergies, based on what you are eating if you're breastfeeding or the formula. My sons all were allergic to dairy, something that was not discovered until toddlerhood in the 2nd son. There was concern because the kids would act out severely and scream, and I mean bad behavior even for toddlers. Also was accompanied with a diaper rash and diarreah. When they were taken off of dairy the problems stopped completely. This has helped us avoid allergy problems with the last 2 boys, though #3 was allergic to soy as well so he went through all the formulas before ending up on nutramigen. The baby is still breastfeeding and I plan on continuing so as to avoid the whole formula and dairy problem completely. 

Make sure you're getting enough sleep too, sounds like you need your energy to keep up with your baby. Try shift sleeping if you have to, while somebody else stays up on alternating nights so that you get a chance to rest. Also depending on your baby's age, you may want to try having your baby sleep in bed with you, at least for daytime naps if not night too, or just temporarily until you figure out what the problem is. If you're worried about the risks, simply laying in bed with baby while you're awake should be safe enough. Talk to a pediatrician if you're worried about that, but sometimes babies just need to be cuddled with and being horizontal with you may relax them enough to sleep better than just rocking or sitting up.

As for the sleeping.  Does he sleep better when you hold him?  My daughter slept in her car seat for a very long time.  We also bought and used a sheep skin rug.  She slept better when she was really warm, and the rug helped to keep her warm.  Because of her reflux, I also used a rolled up towel to prop the head end of her bed up.  

We also used the Nutramagen (spelling?) formula that the other poster mentioned.  It also really helped with the reflux.

ORAL REHYDRATION SOLUTION

How it works to save children's lives


Use of Oral Rehydration Salts to Control Diarrhoeal Diseases

Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS), a mixture of water, salts and glucose in specific proportions, was developed in 1968 by researchers in Calcutta and Dhaka as a treatment for cholera.  The solution, as simple as a home remedy, was found to be--and remains--the best way to rehydrate a child suffering from diarrhoea. 

It became the cornerstone of Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT), which emphasizes giving a child plenty of fluids--ORS and/or other appropriate household fluids--along with continued feeding during the illness and increased feeding for at least a week after. 

Oral rehydration therapy means giving special liquids by mouth to people who are dehydrated. These liquids contain optimal amounts of water, salt, potassium, sugar and other nutrients that need replenishing. 

ORT is the giving of fluid by mouth to prevent and/or correct the dehydration that is a result of diarrhoea. As soon as diarrhoea begins, treatment using home remedies to prevent dehydration must be started. 

Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) is a simple, cost-effective treatment given at home using either a simple home solution of sugar, salt and water or a packet of Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS), costing about 10 cents each can prevent about 90% of child deaths from diarrhoeal dehydration.

It's the most effective, least expensive way to manage diarrhoeal dehydration

-----------------------------------
10 Things you should know about Rehydrating a child.
-----------------------------------

Wash your hands with soap and water before preparing solution.
  
Prepare a solution, in a clean pot, by mixing

- one teaspoon salt and 8 teaspoons sugar
    or 
- 1 packet of Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS)
- with one litre of clean drinking or boiled water (after cooled)

Stir the mixture till all the contents dissolve.
  
Wash your hands and the baby's hands with soap and water before feeding solution.
  
Give the sick child as much of the solution as it needs, in small amounts frequently.
  
Give child alternately other fluids - such as breast milk and juices.
  
Continue to give solids if child is four months or older.
  
If the child still needs ORS after 24 hours, make a fresh solution.
  
ORS does not stop diarrhoea. It prevents the body from drying up. The diarrhoea will stop by itself.
  
If child vomits, wait ten minutes and give it ORS again. Usually vomiting will stop.
  
If diarrhoea increases and /or vomiting persists, take child over to a health clinic.

-------------------------
Signs and symptoms

Signs of mild dehydration are thirst, decreased urine volume and urine that is darker than usual, tiredness, no tears when crying, dry mouth, and dizziness when standing.

Signs of moderate to severe dehydration can include no urine output, lethargy or extreme sleepiness, seizures, sunken fontanel (soft spot) in infants, fainting, and sunken eyes.

-------------------------------
The amount of rehydration that is needed depends on the size of the individual and the degree of dehydration. Rehydration is generally adequate when the person no longer feels thirsty and has a normal urine output. A rough guide to the amount of ORS solution needed in the first 4-6 hours of treatment for a mildly dehydrated person is:

Up to 5 kg (11 lbs): 200 – 400 ml 
5-10 kg (11-22 lbs): 400 – 600 ml 
10-15 kg (22-33 lbs): 600 – 800 ml 
15-20 kg (33–44 lbs): 800 – 1000 ml 
20-30 kg (44-66 lbs): 1000 – 1500 ml 
30-40 kg (66-88 lbs): 1500 – 2000 ml 
40 plus kg (88 lbs): 2000-4000 ml

<td>how to stop crying before naps and sleeping for 6 month old? If possible?</td>
<td>Crying is one of the ways that babies learn to put themselves to sleep.  Just let them do it.  If they are still crying after 20 minutes, then you may want to check and make sure that nothing is wrong.  As they better learn to soothe themselves to sleep, the crying will become less frequent.

However, if you REALLY want to stop them from crying before their naps, then I suggest looking at the signs that your baby is tired BEFORE the crying starts.  Some babies will start rubbing their eyes, yawning, or seem extra cuddly when they are getting tired.  When they are showing those signs, go ahead and wrap them up and put them down for a nap.</td>

<td>what is the best way of taking care of an eczema(face area) to a newborn baby?</td>
<td>It looks like my baby has dandruff. Is it cradle cap?
Probably. Cradle cap is very common. If your baby's scalp has flaky, dry skin that looks like dandruff, or even thick, oily, yellowish scaling or crusting patches, it's most likely cradle cap. Cradle cap isn't pretty, but it's harmless. Most often it shows up in the first few months of life, and it usually clears up on its own after several months — six or seven at the most — although some babies have it until they near their first birthday.

You might notice the same condition around your baby's ears or eyebrows, or even in his armpits and other creases. When it's not on his scalp, it's called seborrheic dermatitis. 

What causes it?
We don't know. For some time, experts believed that the hormones your baby received from you at the end of pregnancy overstimulated your baby's oil-producing (seborrheic) glands, resulting in cradle cap. But with further research there seems to be less agreement about the culprit. What we do know is that it's not caused by poor hygiene or allergies. It's not contagious, and it probably doesn't bother your baby at all, although if it gets severe it might itch. 

How should I treat my baby's flaky scalp?
You don't really need to do anything, but if it bothers you, try more frequent shampooing and gently brushing your baby's scalp with a soft brush or a terrycloth towel. Some parents find a vegetable oil remedy helpful, especially to loosen any dry flakes. If you want to give it a try, rub just a small amount of vegetable oil (such as olive oil) on your baby's scalp, and leave it on for about 15 minutes. Then comb out the flakes with a fine-tooth comb or brush them with a soft brush. Make sure you follow up by washing your baby's scalp with a gentle baby shampoo — the last thing you want to do is leave oil (which can cause the flakes to stick) on his head. You might try leaving the shampoo on for a few minutes before rinsing, to help cut the oil. 

Should I take my baby to the doctor?
Talk with your baby's doctor if your baby's cradle cap persists beyond age 6 months, is severe, or spreads beyond his scalp. She may suggest an over-the-counter or prescription seborrhea shampoo, or, for an inflamed scalp, a cortisone cream. 

Can I prevent it from coming back?
Once your baby's cradle cap is completely gone, it's unlikely to return, but to help remove dead skin while it's waning, you might want to give your baby more frequent shampooing. Don't overdo it, though, or you can further stimulate his oil-producing glands. A cleansing two or three times a week with a mild shampoo should be plenty.</td>

I would suggest getting them on the same schedule with eating, so that their diapers are also changed at the same times... When my twins came home from the hospital, they were on opposite schedules.... I was up feeding one every hour, and it was terrible... Also, make sure you have someone to help you... especially at night.... then you can take turns on which one gets up to feed them, and actually achieve SOME sleep... I don't think I slept at all the first month while trying to get them on the same schedule... If you have a twins club in the area where you live, they are awsome, they help with clothes and all, cause with eveyone having twins in the group, there is always someone there looking to give some away...

That is why abortions are not legal after the fetus is so old, and she obviously knew this, otherwise she would have just had a regular abortion instead of doing it herself. The abortion clinic must have turned her away, if she payed them a visit. Not sure of the exact weeks the baby has to have reached, but it would definitely be by the third trimester. And if you say she is giving birth tomorrow, that would be well past her third trimester. But not really sure of the legal implications.
And actually, the fetus is considered a person after it reaches a certain stage of development in weeks in utero.

Actually I believe the law was referring to 2nd trimester abortions which would be 26 weeks.</td>

<td>How much baby food should be given when first starting out?</td>
<td>At first, food is just a new experience, not a nutritional supplement.  Breastmilk supplies all needed nutrition for the first year, so let your baby lead the way.  Never force a child to eat and don't be suprised if the food you've so carefully spooned in all comes right back out.  

If you're using jarred foods, spoon a little out into a separate bowl, then put the jar in the fridge.  Don't use the baby's spoon in the jar, saliva will cause food to spoil faster.

A traditional first food is egg yolk (not the white, they can often cause allergies).  Babies are often unable to process grain foods for the first year because they lack amylase, the enzyme required to break down wheat and other grain-based carbohydrates.

There is a good article on first foods linked below.  Good Luck!</td>

<td>When should babies stop using bottles and use sippy cups?</td>
<td>At the age of 1 is about right, transitioning children is a slow process.  Weening off the bottle is particularly difficult for some parents. 

I used sippy cups during the day, and slowly weened them off the bottle during the day.  I only gave them one bottle, usually the night time one, till they no longer required the bottle to sleep.

I would also reinforce their progress by saying, WOW--you're a big boy/girl now, drinking from a cup just like mommy and daddy, and me-maw and pop-pop, or other grown siblings.

I also decreased the number of bottles that we kept in the kitchen. Out of sight out of mind, kind of thing.  I ended up having only one bottle around, and slowly it just disappeared too, especially after it got lost and the nipple was stuck with all kinds of lint--I showed the bottle to the baby, and said EWWW that's nasty, let's get a sippy cup instead. Parents tend to come up with some pretty outrageous things when weening kids, don't be surprised.

What is rotavirus?

Rotavirus is a virus that infects the bowels. It is the most common cause of severe diarrhea among infants and children throughout the world. The name rotavirus comes from the characteristic wheel-like appearance of the virus when viewed by electron microscopy (the name rotavirus is derived from the Latin rota, meaning "wheel"). 

Almost all children have become infected with rotavirus by their third birthday. Repeat infections with different viral strains are possible, and most children have several episodes of rotavirus infection in the first years of life. After several infections with different strains of the virus, children acquire immunity to rotavirus. Children between the ages of six and 24 months are at greatest risk for developing severe disease from rotavirus infection. Adults sometimes become infected, but the resulting illness is usually mild. 

Each year in the U.S., rotavirus infection results in the hospitalization of an estimated 70,000 children, 160,000 emergency room visits in children younger than 5, and half a million visits to doctor’s offices. It is estimated that 100 children die each year in the U.S. from complications of rotavirus infection. Rotavirus affects populations in all socioeconomic groups and is equally prevalent in industrialized and developing countries, so differences in sanitation practices or water supply are not likely to affect the incidence of the infection. 

In the U.S., rotavirus infections usually peak in the fall months in the southwest and spread to the northeast by spring, so infections are most common during the winter months. However, infection with rotavirus can occur at any time of the year. 

What are rotavirus symptoms? 

The time period from initial infection to symptoms (incubation period) for rotavirus disease is around 2 days. Symptoms of the disease include fever, vomiting, and watery diarrhea. Abdominal pain may also occur, and infected children may have profuse watery diarrhea up to several times per day. Symptoms generally persist for three to nine days. Immunity from repeated infection is incomplete after a rotavirus infection, but repeated infections tend to be less severe than the original infection. 

Rotavirus infection can be associated with severe dehydration in infants and children. Severe dehydration can lead to death in rare cases, so it is important to recognize and treat this complication of rotavirus infection. In addition to the symptoms of rotavirus infection discussed above, parents should be aware of the symptoms of dehydration that can occur with rotavirus infection or with other serious conditions. 

Symptoms of dehydration include: 

Lethargy 
Dry, cool skin 
Absence of tears when crying 
Dry or sticky mouth 
Sunken eyes or sunken fontanelle (the soft spot on the head of infants) 
Extreme thirst</td>

<td>can you fly with babies?</td>
<td>Can you bring your own car seat on the plane? Will the gate agent announce preboarding for families with young children? Can you gate-check a stroller? Airline policies change frequently, so it's a good idea to call ahead or check your airline's Web site every time you fly to make sure you know what to expect. 

Standard practices for U.S.-based airlines
Most U.S.-based airlines follow these policies on all domestic flights (though it can't hurt to double-check before you buy your ticket):
• Babies must be at least 7 days old to fly. (Some airlines allow younger infants with a doctor's written permission; others extend the minimum age up to 14 days or have additional restrictions.)

• Lap babies (under age 2) fly free on domestic flights, usually one per paying adult; you may need to present proof of age. This does save you money, but it's important to note that babies riding airplanes are safest in government-approved car seats (the label should read "This restraint is certified for use in motor vehicles and aircraft"). Your airline might allow you to bring your car seat on board if the flight isn't full, but there's no guarantee if you haven't bought a ticket for your child.

• The FAA has banned the use of supplemental lap restraints, or "belly belts," in airplanes. Booster seats and harness vests may be used during flight, but not during taxi, takeoff, or landing. Your airline may or may not choose to enforce these rules.

• Children under age 2 typically receive a special discount when you purchase a seat for them (the discount, usually 50 percent off the cost of your ticket, applies to reduced-fare as well as full-price tickets). When you buy a seat for your child, you'll need to bring a government-approved car seat for him to sit in on the plane. Airlines typically require that car seats be placed in window and middle seats away from exit rows; some airlines impose additional restrictions. 

• Children ages 2 and up must have a ticket for their own seat.

• You can check your stroller when you board and pick it up as you exit the plane.

• If you book your flight on the Web, make sure the site offers options for selecting discounted fares for young children. Some, such as Yahoo and Travelocity, don't allow you to book discounted children's seats at all. Expedia, on the other hand, not only lets you book such seats, it searches flights for children's discounts. Still, to cover all the bases, you might want to call your airline first to ask about its discount policy. If you're bringing a lap baby on board, you can book your flights online through services such as Expedia and Orbitz, but you should call the airline directly for any specific child-related requests
Important questions to ask before you fly
Airline policies for families vary widely. Many rules, including whether to allow preboarding, are at the discretion of the gate agent. The best advice is to call ahead and ask the following questions, but be prepared for possible changes at the gate. 
• What's the seat discount for a child under age 2? (This question applies if you'd like to pay for a seat for your child rather than holding him in your lap during the flight.)

• Do you offer seat discounts for children 2 and older? If so, for what ages?

• Will you require proof of my child's age and identity? If so, what proof is required, and when do I present it? (As crazy as it sounds, some babies have been denied boarding because their names are similar to suspected terrorists on "no-fly" lists. Carrying a government-issued birth certificate or passport may help avoid such snarls.)

• Can we get seats in a bulkhead row? (Bulkhead seats have more room to stand and maneuver, but less room for stowing carry-ons.)

• Are bassinets available on the flight? When should I reserve one? (Bassinets are only available for lap babies, a</td>

<td>9mths food n oxygen were supplied by moms, What triggers new-born baby to switch breathing thru lungs?</td>
<td>During childbirth the placenta slowly starts to stop the transfer of blood between the mother and child.  As the child's blood oxygen levels begin to decrease the respiratory demand increases.  For most babies, little stimulation is needed for that first breath of air.  It is important though that it be a good one as the alveolar sacs within the lungs inflate at this point.  If there is a problem, such as muconium (baby poops while in the womb) or not enough strength as can happen in premies, there can be many complications.  Also, it is not until the 8th month of fetal decelopment that the lungs produce the mucous they need to properly inflate the lung sacs.  If babies are born before this time, they often need synthetic or bovine suplemented surfactant for their lungs to function properly.  The liquid that is in the lungs during the pregnancy is the amneotic fluid which is different the fluid we have normally in our lungs to function properly, without it, our alveolar sacs would collapse each time we exhaled.  Obviously not a good thing.  The actual intake of air for the first time comes from a signal from the hypothalamus in the brain caused by the stimulus of an oxygen rich environment.  Instinct some would say.  Amazing design I say.</td>

<td>How do i help my child get over separation anxiety she is 8 mos old.?</td>
<td>You can't make the child get over it, but you can make it easier to handle.  Anxiety peeks between 6-18 months, and it will be hard to master the leaving of your crying child, but you can do it!    I found it was easier to leave my son with a family member.  I started leaving the room, then the house for a few minutes, the baby gets reassured that you will come back, and you get comfortable leaving her when she's crying.  I usually say "bye bye cutie pie, mama will be back in....(tell the baby how long you'll be gone, I know it sounds silly, but eventually she'll notice the time).  You have to leave when you leave, don't keep coming back to check on the baby, it just makes it worse for everyone.  It may feel like the world's going to end, but it usually lasts no longer than five minutes, a good family member or sitter can handle it.  Don't leave when your child can't see you, it makes it worse if it seems like you've just dissappeared.  Let her see you walk away, but don't keep turning around and blowing kisses or waving, just leave.  Hopefully, the person caring for her can have her at the window when you return so she can see you DO come back.  It will take time, but it will get easier too.  Just make sure you leave your numbers and where you will be, so if she doesn't get over it, you can be easily reached.  I would also recommend leaving her with a special toy, one she only gets when you're gone.  That way her caregiver can use that to distract her from her crying after you leave.  Hope this helps, it's what I did.  My son developed his anxiety when he was about 5 months old, I am a stay-at-home mom.  Now, he's 10 months old and loves to leave me!  He stayed the weekend with his cousins when he was 9 months.  Trust me, it will get easier!</td>

Supply of diapers enough to last length of time you'll be out, plus a couple extra just in case.
Supply of wipes - I put a bunch in a big plastic zip loc bag and put a little extra water over them to keep them moist (you don't have to buy a special travel pack)
Changing Pad
Diaper rash cream
An extra set of clothes
A small toy or two 
A few plastic bags (the kind from the grocery store are fine and they don't take up much room when you scrunch them up) so you can put soiled diapers in there if you're at someone's house and would like to seal off a poopy diaper.
Whatever you need to facilitate feeding - if packing for a newborn and you're breastfeeding then nothing (except maybe a snack/water for yourself), but if bottle feeding a bottle with the water already inside and put the formula in a separate container to mix when ready.  And when it comes to packing for a baby's nutritional needs, always take more than you think you'll need in case you get delayed - better to have more than not enough.
As the baby gets older and is eating food and drinking other things, always have snacks (crackers, cheese, fruit, cheerios, yogurt, raisins, whatever) and a sippy cup of water.</td>

They can monitor different treatments and make sure they are working effectively. Most importantly... if you are breastfeeding, don't stop!! Even if you need to take a prescription anti-depressant there are ones that are safe. Nursing helps keep your hormones more stable and actually decreases the incidence of PPD. It took about 3 months for me to start feeling totally like myself again but the first month and a half were definitely the worst.

Some treatments that worked for me:
- taking vitamin B complex capsules
- taking fish oil capsules
- getting some kind of exercise every day

Thomas Hale, RPh, PhD, author of Medications and Mothers' Milk, says that St. John's Wort appears to be relatively safe for nursing mothers, but recommends that caution be used. He suggests that other treatments (Zoloft, Paxil) are probably preferred.</td>

<td>how can you teach an enfant to sleep in a crib when they are used to co-sleeping?</td>
<td>You, the parents, suffer for a while...LOL  When the baby is used to sleeping with mom and dad it will take some getting used to for baby to sleep in their own crib/bed.  With my kids, my first child I did not know this about and when I finally tried to put her in her crib it took 2 weeks of screaming for her to get used to it.  So be prepared for losing sleep - try it over a weekend so you can at least recuperate a bit.  When they are crying go over and comfort but always put them back in their bed.  There will come a time when you know when to comfort and when to let them cry.  Good luck!</td>

<td>what table food to feed a 9 month old?</td>
<td>You can purchase baby foods that offer your infant new tastes and textures, or you can fork-mash, cut up, or grind whatever foods you may be serving the rest of the family. You should cook it a little longer, until it's very soft, and cut it into small pieces that your baby can handle to decrease the risk of choking.

ideas :
mashed potatoes
vienna sausages
cooked soft carrots
creamed corn
apple sauce

I used a thunder stick http://store.yahoo.com/wonderfulbuysca/thunsticpro.html to make my own food for my daughter and fed her what I ate and now she loves all different kinds of food because I didn't limit her to the same old things. Just make sure you make the food soft and if she doesn't like what you give her let her make up her own mind whether or not SHE likes it....then try the same meal in a month or so as her tastes will change.</td>

He still likes to drink his milk out of a bottle(he'll be 1 next week), but we are down to only one bottle a day.  I also started giving him a regular cup at 10 months.  He has his own "special" (plastic) cups, and I try to have him drink out of it atleast once a day.  We started with a very small amount of plain water in his cup; because it will be messy.  He is now able to take about 1/3 of a cup of liquid with only a few dribbles.</td>

<td>Make sure he's well fed before putting him down.  Sounds like he hasn't learned to comfort himself to sleep yet. When he cries the first time, go to him and comfort him.  Don't take him out of the crib.  2nd time he awakes, wait 3 minutes and THEN go comfort him.  3rd time, wait 5 minutes before you go in.  You get the picture.  He should eventually learn to get himself back to sleep w/o you feeling too guilty letting him cry it out.  I always hated doing that.  Good Luck!</td>

<td>Has anyone let their 4-month old cry it out at bedtime?</td>
<td>NO!!!  But please know I am a huge advocate of nightime parenting.  In my opinion, the cry-it-out method is trying to "train" the baby to fall asleep.  Parents are pressured into thinking there is this magic age when your baby should be sleeping through the night...and when that age comes and your baby is still night waking you think "WHAT IS GOING ON?" There are so many reasons why a baby wakes at night and if you let your baby cry-it-out you may be harming him/her instead of helping.  

If you are trying to have your baby sleep through the night I would highly recommend reading "The No Cry Sleep Solution" by Elizabeth Pantley.  It teaches you gentle ways to help your baby sleep through the night.  It worked for me...a mother of a 9 month old high-need baby.

Apparently someone forgot to tell you to sleep while the baby is sleeping &amp; screw the housework for a while, huh?  You can also leave a little time during the day to let "it" cry before you feed &amp; whatever else you have to do.  Probably better, though, to try &amp; give "it" some attention &amp; try to keep "it" awake a little bit more.
Babies are on a whacked out schedule &amp; sleep when it's good for them, so you're going to have to deal with it until that schedule modifies itself a little bit.
And stop calling your baby "it."</td>

When he was about 6 months, I tried to give him formula so I could sleep a little more at night but he didn't like what I gave him. I used Similac and also tried Infamil. He didn't like either one, so I was surprised he too Carnation good start. If your baby doesn't like Carnation, try other brands.  Also, make sure you get the right formula appropriate to your baby's age.

As far as gassiness, formula has nothing to do with it. Babies are normally gassy. Some bottles claim they can reduce  gas, but it will not eliminate it. Just make sure that when you bottle feed, to burp your baby every 1-2 oz. You don't have to do it as much as your baby gets older, but burp often when your baby is a couple of months old.</td>

<td>"Water for Babies 

When is it appropriate to give your baby water?

• Ask Us: Your questions answered by experts

Your baby just finished nursing, but now she's sucking on her hands. When you pick her up, she starts to nuzzle into your arms. She can't possibly be hungry again, can she? What does she want? "Maybe she's thirsty," your mother says. "It's pretty warm out, after all. Give her some water."

Do babies need water to drink? A 1997 study at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta found that about 25 percent of new mothers gave their babies water at least three times per week in the first month of life. The researchers felt this was a significant problem.

As Toronto lactation consultant Anne Kirkham explains, "Giving water to young babies can make some undesirable things happen and can suppress other good things."

For example, in the first days after birth, drinking water has been found to increase the severity of newborn jaundice. "Babies who are breastfeeding well don't have much problem with jaundice," says Kirkham, "but those who are given water as well will become more jaundiced, and this makes them sleepy and lethargic."

Giving water in the early weeks can also interfere with breastfeeding. The infant who has a tummy full of water will drink less milk at his feedings, and his mother's breasts will decrease milk production in response. The result: The baby gets less milk, and may not grow as well. One study in Australia found that newborns who were given water with sugar after each feeding at the breast lost more weight than babies who were breastfed exclusively. In addition, if the water is given in a bottle, the baby's sucking technique may become confused.

"It's common for babies to have periods of cluster feedings when they feed frequently for a few hours," Kirkham adds. "But because parents don't expect this, they worry that the baby is unsatisfied and wants something else, so they give the baby a drink of water."

While decreased milk production isn't a concern with babies who are fed formula, water is not good for those babies either, since it will reduce their intake of formula. Too much water can even be dangerous: In rare cases, infants have died from water intoxication, and others have developed seizures or hypothermia. Almost all of these babies were bottle-fed.

But what if it's really hot outside? Do babies need water then? Some physicians, such as Danielle Grenier of the Canadian Paediatric Society, say it's OK to add water to formula during very hot and humid weather only if your baby is dehydrated or running a fever. (The water should be boiled if the baby is under six months.)

Research shows that babies don't normally need extra water. A 1978 Jamaican study of exclusively breastfed babies found no signs of dehydration in temperatures averaging 27.6 degrees C. In 1990, the same researcher studied babies in India, where the temperature ranged between 35 and 40 degrees C. Again, the exclusively breastfed babies showed no signs of dehydration and needed no extra water.

"In the summer, when the baby might be a little more thirsty, the milk will be slightly more watery. In the winter, babies receive more creamy milk," Kirkham explains. Of course, nursing mothers should be prepared to drink extra water during hot weather. (The standard advice is "drink to thirst," because if you drink too much, you may decrease your milk supply.)

So when is it appropriate to give your healthy baby water? Kirkham suggests that around seven months, when your baby is sitting up well and has started eating solid foods, you could </td>

But...we found out we were expecting a boy and my dad didn't like his name so we weren't going to name him after him. My hubby's dad had his name used for our nephew who was born a year earlier. And my hubby didn't want to use his name. So we didn't really decide until I was in labor. LOL

My hubby's brother said he wished he had named his son Henry, he liked that name. And we always kept that name on the list because we warmed up to it a lot too. It's a name that isn't too common now, and we didn't want a Top 10 name. It's old-fashioned and you can't mispronounce it. :)

I'm assuming that you don't have any other mommy friends, but you could also just try to get to know your neighbors better, and invite them to your house, set up your own playdate, so to speak. if you truely can't find anyone in your own neighborhood, or if you just don't want to go to the hassle, you can always try to make friends with other moms online, although this is not near as effective, because your child won't get any interaction with any other kids and will probablly resent you ignoring them to type on the computer.

Some babies are faster with their development skills. For example, my first was ahead on his motor development skills, such as crawling, sitting up on his own, but he was slower on his social skills. 

The onlt thing to be careful about with your 4 month old sitting up is that he doesnt 'jack-fold.' This is when they fold forward. Doing this can cause back problems, and cause their ribs to poke other internal organs and can cause harm. Other than that, congrats for you and your baby!</td>

<td>How can I keep my 2month old from being so constipated all the time?</td>
<td>breastmilk is the best natural laxative a baby can have. If you're breastfeeding then keep up, giving extra feedings, and drink tons of fruit juice, it will go through your milk and act to help move things along. If you're not breastfeeding, see about ways to stimulate the milk and try again. Formulas are made from cows milk which is not designed to be digested easily by human babies. They also add iron which can constipate babies. Many doctors are pro-formula because they get 'kickbacks' from the formula companies or they just think scientifically. But breastmilk has so many advantages, including being a natural laxative and best for baby. Don't give baby any rice cereal or other solid foods, she could be a slow pooper. My son's regular pattern for the first 4-5 months was about 4-5 days inbetween bowel movements, solely breastfed. He was INCREDIBLY healthy and his body just wasn't wasting a drop of breastmilk, shooting up to 20 lbs by 5-6 months! We did have to give him more fruit, pears were great, when he was about 4-5 months old because when he did have a bowel movement it seemed strained because he didn't have much to poop out, or it had been so long in there. So the fruit gave him something to move through his system and now he has perfectly normal bowel movements, 1-3 a day. (9 months old now). You might want to find another pediatrician, because depending on suppositories is not a good idea for your baby, as her body may become dependent on them to have a bowel movement.</td>

<td>Is it OK to give a pacifier to an infant less than a week old that breast feeds?</td>
<td>Your baby will be fine if you give her a pacifier. IT wouldn't affect breastfeeding at all. Some babies just have a very strong sucking reflex and would not calm down without it. Just remember to check first that your baby is not wet/dirty, uncomfortable, and most importantly that she's not hungry before you give the pacifier. You don't want her to miss feedings.

My son got his first pacifer while in the hospital (2 days old). That was the only thing that would calm him down.</td>

<td>My daughter is due in a little over a month.  From what I have read and my discussions with moms that I've worked with, met in the grocery store, met at the bank, and anywhere in between, natural birth is the option that I am pursuing.  If you stay active during your pregnancy, do kegel exercises, stretch your perineum muscles, eat well and stay healthy you should have an easy natural birth.  I also am interested in the water birth, again without medication, because I have also heard that it is more relaxing especially between contractions and pushing.</td>

<td>How do you know if a baby is sick?</td>
<td>Sounds like your a new mom.  I can relate to your question cause it is a very scary time with a precious little person depending on you for all their needs and care.  If the baby feels "hot" to the touch, cries a lot even thought they've been feed and changed, they have coughing or runny noses, or if they become very quite and listless, it's time to get them checked out.  Don't worry about "overworrying" and taking them to the doctor too many times, too many is way better than not enough.  Best solution, when in doubt, take the precious baby to the doctor, never hurts to have them checked out.

2. No Things (again, this is strange)

3. Nothing "trendy" (You want your kid to be in school with 10 other kids with the same name??)

4. No words you might hear in the hospital.  My cousin works in a Pre-Natal care area, and people actually name their kids after DISEASES they hear in the hospital.

5. No Seasons (The age of the hippy is over)

6. No last names for a first name (That's just pretentious and snobby)

7. No "uni-sex" names like "Chris" or "Kelly", that's just confusing when they get older and go into the business world

8. Don't make up a name to sound "Ethnic" and cool, because again, think of them in the business world with a goofy name.

Feel free to screw with your kids and name them something stupid if you want.  But don't be mad when people talk behind your back about how much of a freak you are.</td>

<td>Will a baby who takes less breastmilk than formula for about 6 months still get all the benefits of breastmilk</td>
<td>Yes. A loto of women suplement with formula and if your not crazy about the formula you can always try pumping. your breast milk is supply and demand so if you aren't feeding a whole lot or if the baby is not eating as much you will not produce as much. If you are having a hard time with breastfeeding most women will tell you it takes about 3 months before you and the baby really get into a good pattern of things. If you just simply can't breastfeed due to your current lifestyle but don't want to give it up all together formula will do no harm. you can breastfeed as little or as much as you want just keep in mind that if you slow down it takes a while to pick back up if you want to feed more often afterwards but it can be done.</td>

<td>Gerber Eletric Breast Pump?</td>
<td>I don't have the instructions but  i felt the need to reply for a good reason. I bought a gerber pump when i was pregnant and i couldn't for the life of me get it to work right. I asked the lactation consultant at my hospital for advice and she told me not to use it as the gerber pump will most likely dry you out. Gerber is a baby food company and they want you to buy thier products so the pumps made by them acctually push air towards your breast causing you to slowly dry up instead of producing more milk (when i tried using it i could feel the air and nothing would come out , i just thought i was using it wrong). I'm sure there are a few people who have had luck with it but i did feel i should warn you for if you have your heart set on breast feeding and pumping it's good to know just in case. They sell a really good manual at target by avent i beleive she said and an electric that costs about 300.00 that she highly recommended. Before using this pump you have i hope you will call your hospital and ask to speak to the lactation consultant there. she should be able to help you if you still plan on using it or tell you what other ones are good. I was heart broken when the pump i had refused to work.

The women who answered above me i believe recommended the same to you that my lactation consultant did for me. Mandella and avent sorry i could not remember the name when writing above. Good luck</td>

If she is over 4 months and showing these signs I'd say go for it. Make it very runny at first and just try it out, start with a very little bit the first time and work her up to more.

<td>First of all, the decision is yours and the baby's father. Other people may offer suggestions, but they are not the parents. If you let them start making decisions for you now, it will only get worse. Let them know (nicely) that you are the parent, and all advice and suggestions are welcome, but you make the final decisions. Then, find out why they don't like the name. Does it have bad feelings associated with it, are there too many people with that name in the family, already, or do they just think you are weird for wanting "Rain"? (I can ask that, since my daughter's middle name is Raine, and I have had no end of "hippie" comments. We love it, so the comments just roll off our backs.)If they don't give you a good reason, then just smile and list some of the nicknames they can get from it. Another thing to do is look up the meanings of the names, just to be safe. Remember, you are the mother. Unless your husband has a solid reason for not wanting this name, go for it. (But, if you feel he is not being forthcoming regarding his reasons, tread carefully.) And be sure to speak to him privately about this. That way there's no outside pressure. Again, keep in mind that pressure being exerted now by "grandparents" and such may be a sign of things to come. Put it in check (with love) before it gets out of hand. And best of luck.</td>

<td>My 7mth old baby constipates.  Pls help!!?</td>
<td>We went through a lot of this as our son starting a couple days after birth he had cronic constipation. We have no problems now as i pay attention to the fiber and potassium intake very close. Before trying and perscriptions or over the counter medications, you can try a few different things....

1 teaspoon dark kayro syrup with either water or in his milk. (the water will not hurt him and the kayro will sweeten it, most babies like it if anything)

some apple or prune juice and at his age it should not need to be diluted unless you feel the need to do so

inserting a thermometer just barely into the rectom may help as he will may feel the need to push (this advice is from the hospital and doctors i have spoken with, it's not as mean as it sounds)

since he is 7 months you are feeding him jar food i would imagine... so try feeding him food that are high in fiber and low in potassium. high potassium will cause constipation. (green beans, applesauce, zuccini, ect) look on the back of the jars for help in this.

just drinking a couple oz of water can also help if you want to at least try it.

if all else fails call the doc and see what they recomend. They perscribed lactolose syrup for our son and it worked great. they may give you something different or suggest gylcerin supositories.

It can be very normal for a child not to go for a day or so even up to 7 days. However if  he is 7 months old then I'm sure he is more regular with his bowel movements and you know his routin by now i am sure. Some foods especially since he is probably trying many new things these day can contribute to this. I hope one of these works for you. If you still have no luck within another day or so definately let your doc know.</td>

<td>What's the difference in price between a live-in nanny and a live-out nanny?</td>
<td>Having a live-in nanny can save you a little bit of money, although you need to take into consideration electricity usage, water usage, ect. of having another person in your home.  Also, make sure to have a really set schedule for your nanny's hours, you need to realize that she will have her own life, too (don't expect to be able to ask her to do "little things" like watch the kids for 5 minutes while you run to the store if it's her designated day off!).  Having a live in nanny can be convienient for both parties, as long as neither party takes advantage of the situation.  I would say you could offer the living space, utilities, ect. as about $300 to $500 of her pay (depending on the living space).</td>

If your child is a little delayed, it may take more time.  Just be patient.  Try to let him do a little more by himself each time.  Suddenly he will have it and you will have succeeded in helping him gain one step more in his own independence.</td>

Your child is only going to be little once and you can't get all of those precious moments back.  I would talk with him and let him know that not only are you concerned he's not getting enough time in with your child, but that you worry that your child is not getting enough time with him. 

Mention that while you appreciate all he does, that you too would like to pursue such and such activity (fill in the blank) and when does he think you guys can squeeze that into your busy schedules.  

Personally I would really avoid being confrontational because it will only piss him off and make things worse.  He may also not feel comfortable being alone with your baby..but if you slowly allow him to have some of the responsibility he's bound to enjoy himself so that you can go off alone and enjoy yourself too.

<td>my baby's 5 months old and still won't try solid foods?</td>
<td>Someone said don't feed solid foods until your baby is a year old and that is incorrect. My son is turning 1 year old this weekend and he has been on solid foods since he was 6 or 7 months. It's okay if your baby won't eat solid foods at first, mine didn't either. He still won't eat certain types of baby food but he will eat most table food (don't start feeding table food for a few months). It's best if you try to feed it to them once and then wait a few days and try again. It usually takes a couple tries to get a baby to eat a certain type of food. Experiment with different things...fruits, veggies, etc. My son's favorite food was sweet potatoes. I'd try that because most babies LOVE sweet potatoes. Hope this helps.</td>

We feed our kids (21 month twin boys) dinner and a bottle of milk before bed.  They don't need more milk at night so far.

The Ferber method is what you're referring to as crying to sleep.  It's very difficult to do because of all the crying, but it does work to teach your child to sleep on his/her own.  We tried it around 6 months, and my wife couldn't handle it.  It broke her heart to hear the crying for 45-60 minutes.  I was the one that handled the kids at the time.  It really does work to get your child to sleep, but you have to stick with it.

Good luck!</td>

My son also chews on everything. He is 12 months old and already has 6 teeth, but I'm sure some more are ready to come out the way he's chewing on things. He's chewed on all his books and sometimes chew on the corners of my wooder step stools.</td>

<td>Breastfeeding Q?</td>
<td>First, congratulations on your baby.  Second, your nearly 3 week old has hit the first growth spurt!  Babies usually have them at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months and moms notice that baby all the sudden wants to nurse ALL THE TIME!  This is normal . . . your baby is nursing more often to tell your breasts to produce more milk.  When baby empties the breast (a false phrase, they don't get empty), your body gets a signal to refill.  When the baby is eating more often, the body is getting that signal frequently and increases the amount of milk available.  This usually takes 2-3 days to take full effect.  It's not exactly fun, but it's nature's way.  

On your other concerns . . . if you really aren't eating enough, it can affect your supply, but it is more likely that you will be lacking in some nutrients.  The only concern with this related to baby is that some nutrients are not stored in the body, so you need to eat them to pass them on.  I wouldn't worry too much though; women have fed their babies while starving compared to how we live and the babies were ok; just do the best you can.  

The best way to tell if baby is getting enough is weight gain.  If she's gaining well, then she's getting enough.  Short of weighing her all the time, the next best thing is  diapers.  5-6 wet diapers (really wet) and 3-4 poopy a day is "normal".    

You can pump if you want to, or if you need to get practice before returning to work, but I would still wait a few weeks if you can.  It's best to wait to introduce the bottle for about 4-6 weeks, more if you want.  Pumping won't do much for your supply right now because your baby is significantly more efficant at stimulating the breast (this is true for all women who's baby's can suck, but esp. true for women who have little practice with a breast pump).  

Finally, it is totally normal to have a million doubts.  We all do, about everything.  I think it's part of being a parent.  As soon as you start feeling comfortable with this, your child will start something else confusing.  I'm pretty sure it won't end.  But it is normal and your best course of action is to find other parents to talk to, if for nothing more than reassurance.  

Good luck, and congratulations on the new baby.</td>

<td>Formula vs. breast milk, When is it OK to switch completely to formula and why ?</td>
<td>Breastfeeding is the best food for your baby, and this remains true for quite a lot longer than most people are led to believe. Breastmilk does change over time, to meet the changing needs of the infant/toddler. A 12 month old does not have the same nutritional needs as a 3 week old baby and vice versa, and the milk changes reflect that. There is rarely a reason to switch to formula that couldn't have been addressed in another way if the mother is receiving adequate support and accurate information (both of which are surprisingly hard to come by!) Whenever you begin introducing formula, the supply-and-demand process of breastfeeding is interrupted, and this can cause trouble with milk production. The longer you can avoid using formula, the better for your baby and your breastfeeding relationship. Most pediatricians are sadly uneducated in the area of breastfeeding; it is not a topic that is routinely covered in-depth during their course of study. Because of this they aren't necessarily the best person to consult for advice on this. Each situation should be assessed by a knowledgeable person such as a La Leche Legue leader and possibly a certified lactation consultant. People with appropriate training can look at your individual situation, and help you make the decision that is right for your circumstances and the baby's health. If switching to formula is best for your baby, they can help you to make the transition as smoothly as possible.</td>

If there are white blood cells and the cultures are negative then the patient is diagnosised with viral menegitis.  The patient will be placed on antibiotics for 72 hours till the cultures grow out.  If negative the patient will be taken off antibiotics and they should feel better in a couple of days.  If it is bacterial, meaning something grew out on the cultures, antibiotics are given for 7-10 days depending on the organism.  Usually the medicine is given IV so that means in the hospital or have home health nurses come out.   Any time menegitis is suspected it is always taken seriously, not because of viral menegitis but because of bacterial.  Hope this helps.  Call your doctor and tell him of the exposure though.</td>

<td>No one can take your child away if you can prove that you are a good parent. The only way anyone will come between you and your child is if you are keeping you child in an unsafe enviroment and/or abusing or  neglecting him/her. Even if cps or whatever the child services in you state or province are called tried to take your baby they first have to investigate these things and if your mother is not a suitable parent then they would not place your child with her either they would find a foster home. The best thing you can do is take good care of your home,yourself and your baby well and file a restraining order on you mother so she can not contact you or see your child. If she is hassling you consistantly then this is probably the only way to put a stop to her from your end. Some times people don't pay attention to the restraining orders but at least you have done all you can on your part and are taking some legal percautions.</td>

<td>How can I get my co-worker to understand that an 11 Month cannot understand BE Nice?</td>
<td>I assume you work in a daycare - My mother is a director of one- so I know a thing or to - YOU ARE RIGHT!!! -so give yourself a pat on the back for your patience and understanding. The thing is that not all kids,babies are the same not all of them grasp certain concepts and morals and just plain common curtesy at the same time. Some children simply need a broader explaination of what you are trying to tell them - to the child it is like a game -they are simply exploring their limits - learning what they can and cannot do. Learning what responses they get from their actions -seeing if they get the same responses each time they do something - if you never explain what you mean -how do you know if they know the meaning??? They probably dont.
It could be possible that childs parents never corrects their bad behavior and thinks its cute when they hit them(the parent) I have seen this myself A parent at my moms daycare thought it was cute when her daughter would hit at her and would play along and say "ouch" just to make her daughter laugh - it ended up being a problem and the little girl started hitting and pinching the other kids expecting them to say "OUCH"  in a playful way instead they would cry of course. Any way I would not listen to your co-worker she seems a bit ignorant and lazy -like she doesnt want to deal with the problem and is critisizing you for going the extra mile -like you should for the sake of the childrens interest - you are obviuosly a caring inividual and it sounds like you are in the right profession- I would however care about the concern of the parent - talk to them and let them know you are working with their child to stop this behavior which is natural and possibly has nothing to do with the parents inffluence - I would let the parent know that you try different approaches to help the child understand  and that telling him "BE NICE " hasn't worked and ask her what she says to him that works on him at home - and then I would try what she suggests and when your stubborn co-worker nags at you tell her the childs parent told you what works for her at home and it aint "Be Nice!!!" I'm sure she will get the picture then!!!
 If not than forget her and go about doing things they way you do - you have a good head on your shoulders and will go much farther than she will in this profession. My mother started out in the nursery and ended up being the Director for doing just what you are doing - Putting the childrens best interest at hand and being understanding and providing the most beneficial care - she has won teacher of the year awards from her home state several times and has gotten job offers from corporate daycare centers all over the country but stays at the one she has worked at for ten years because she loves the children - she just cant leave!!!

good luck to you -hope your job goes much smoother!!!</td>

<td>How do i get my son, who is 7 months, to sleep through the night?</td>
<td>When mine would wake up, I was advised to NOT pick them up.  I would go in to comfort them by words, lay my hand softly on their tummy, some kind of gentle contact, and just say a few sweet "mommy" words.  The reason for not picking them up during the night is that they will expect that, and children do learn that behavior quickly.  I was also advised to do this and leave them for a couple of minutes.  If the baby still cried, go back and comfort him/her again in the same way, and wait 5 minutes to go back if they were still crying, and just expand it a minute or two after that.  They learn to soothe themselves.  It worked extremely well, and this only had to be done a couple of nights.  BUT, make sure the baby isn't sick.  I could always tell which kind of cry mine had if he had a tummy ache, etc.  The painful cry is different than the fit-pitching cry.  Just a suggestion, but worked for me!  Good luck mom!!</td>

<td>when is the best time to have a child?</td>
<td>I think it depends on the age of the child.  I wouldn't recommend alot of travel the first year.  My son was good at traveling aged 1-2.  He really loved museums and zoos and places like that.  He was very good at long trips, too.  Now that he is 2, he is not so good on long trips, but he still loves going places once we get there, especially when other children are around.  I think that is a huge thing to consider.  Children who are always only around adults, mature too fast and lack creativity and teamwork, look into it.  I am 21 but I was ready to have a child as I have a 38 year old husband.  I think it depends alot on how you feel and if you are prepared for all the changes that may take place.  Every child is different so there is no way of saying that yes, your child will like traveling and adapt to different places.</td>

<td>when is the risk of SIDS gone for infants?</td>
<td>the risk of sids is all the way up to 2 years however if you are extremely conserned and not getting rest speak to yor pediatrician about an apnea monitor. with my first child he snored and i didn't worry about him unless i heard him snoring. with my second one he has some serious health problems. I went about 2 months without sleep unless he was on a monitor. my doctor told me that the only way to get peice of mind would be to get an apnea monitor for home. it really helped i could sleep during the night with the baby. I never put either babies in the bed with me to sleep, well my older one sleeps with me now and has since he was almost 2, i have kept both of them in the room with me (my husbands work sceduale keeps us home alone at nights) its easier for me to keep an eye on them. 

the biggest thing is following the guidelines with back to sleep, pacifiers (btw dont ever put a pacifier in a babies mouth while they are asleep, if it falls out leave it until they wake up u can push their tounge in their throat and cause them to suffacate), keep the babies out of the bed with you (i know of 2 cases of sids in this area (my husbabd is a paramedic and picked these babies up) where the mother rolled over on the babies in bed (horrable situation), just keep a ear open for them, no heavy blankets (what i do is get really heavy sleepers and that keeps my baby warm enough at night so he don't use a blanket, the sids guidelines also mention keeping your thermostat at about 73 degrees or below a cooler house has less instances of sids.

babies are constantly experimenting..some times it is great other times it stinks!

If you have seen his doctor and ruled out colic, hernia, ear infections, hearing problems...and all other reasonable health issues...then the next trick is to teach him when its ok. 

He is learning how to use his voice to elicit response.  When he makes the sound and its not appropriate then tell him no and use the sign language sign for "no". if he continues then put him in his playpen for a minute. 

i know it sounds weird..but i never did this with my first child...and he is learning the rules now...my little one is learning them from the start! what a difference!</td>

<td>Well, when my son was born, he cried pretty loud, and clenched his arms and legs to the center of his body. Didnt really kick, but didnt really hold still. 

As far as babies breathing, they usually take one of these syringe bulbs and suck up the mucus out of the babies nose and mouth so it can clear its entranceway. This is also why the baby cries. It helps clear out the lungs. 

As for eating, that comes pretty naturally to the baby. They will suckle on anything that could be a nipple. LOL

And babies acctually only see black and white for awhile, and can only see about 3 feet in front of them. Pretty much, they can only see from your breast to your face. Thats way even if you dont breast feed, you should still hold them as if you are when you feed them so they can look up into your face.</td>

<td>what do babies do at 6 months old?</td>
<td>Exploring with his hands :
By the time he's about 6 months old (though sometimes it takes a little longer), your baby's hand control is developed enough that he can rake an object toward him. Once he's learned to grab a toy, he'll start to practice moving objects from one hand to the other. He may also discover that letting go of something is as much fun as picking it up. Once he understands the concept of cause and effect, your baby's world will become more interesting -- and yours a good deal messier. 

Learning to roll over :
Most babies this age have learned to roll over in each direction, a milestone that will probably awe and amuse you. Of course, while rolling over is fun for your baby, it can also be nerve-wracking for you. Keep a hand on your baby during diaper changes, and never leave him unattended on a bed or any other elevated surface. 
 
Your little social animal :
At this age babies not only tolerate attention from others, they often initiate it. Though you may soon notice the beginnings of stranger anxiety, 6-month-olds are still fairly indiscriminate: Anyone who approaches your baby with raised eyebrows or a grin delights him and becomes an instant friend. But don't worry -- he still needs and craves lots of TLC and attention from you. 

Your baby is also learning that his behaviors, both the ones you like and the ones you don't, engage you, so starting now (and for years to come) your child will do just about anything to get your attention. Right now almost everything he does is endearing, but as he gets older, he's more likely to get into mischief to provoke a reaction from you. Just don't forget to lavish attention on him when he meets with your approval. 

One thing will become clear: Your baby is beginning to vary his attention-getting repertoire beyond crying. So expect him to work hard to get you to notice him by wriggling, making noises, and so on. Over the next three months, he'll develop a uniquely personal way of letting you know what he thinks, wants, and needs.

Your baby the babbler :
By 6 months your baby sees and hears the world almost as well as you do. His communication skills are expanding rapidly, too, as evidenced by his squeals, bubbling sounds, operatic octave changes, and babbling. At this age, about half of all babies babble, repeating one syllable -- such as "ba," "ma," "ga," or other consonant-vowel combinations -- over and over. A few will even add another syllable or two, making their sounds more complex. You can encourage your baby by babbling right back at him and by making a game of it ("The sheep says, 'baaa,'" or "The goat says, 'maaa'"). He'll also appreciate it if you listen as if you understand everything he says and find it extremely interesting. Your baby can now recognize different tones and inflections and may fall apart if you speak to him harshly. 

One sure-fire way to delight your baby is to blow bubbles with a straw in a cup. Both the sound and sight will make him laugh. 


Stimulating his senses:
Your baby uses all of his senses to explore and learn about his world. Make sure he has lots of safe things around to touch, mouth, and manipulate. He'll delight in squishing a soft rubber ball, patting a piece of fake fur, gnawing a chilled teething ring, and hearing a bell sound inside a stuffed animal. 


Remember, each baby is unique and meets physical milestones at his own pace. These skills are simply a guide to what your baby has the potential to accomplish -- if not right now, then shortly. 

If your baby was born prematurely, you'll probably find that it will be a little while before he can do the same things as other children his age. Don't worry. Most doctors assess a preterm child's development from the time he should have been born and evaluate his skills accordingly.

<td>how do i start weaning and when?</td>
<td>It is recommended to breastfeed for at least one year. at one year you can introduce cows milk. 

Weaning starts when you give your baby solid food. You can start solids from 4-6 months old.  This depends on your baby and your preference.

You wean by replacing what would have been a nursing session with either solid food (cereal or baby food) or cows milk from a bottle or cup (after one year) or formula if less then one year old.

I breastfed my daughter (born 1-31-1997) for almost 2 years and my son (born 8-13-2004) for maybe 13 months (honestly I am not sure the exact time he weaned but it was much sooner then my daughter-he is very into eating solids).</td>

Whereas if she at loads of chocolate, drank whole milk, or ate something rich like cheese cake then her milk will become very rich, thicker, and sweet...making a fat healthy baby!!</td>

<td>Do you have to have a family history of twins, to get pregnant with twins?</td>
<td>Actually it is fraternal twins that are hereditary. If there is a history of fraternal twins on your mother's side of the family then your chance of also having fraternal twins increases by five, this is because fraternal twins occur when two eggs are released per menstrual cycle and both are fertilized. If the mother releases two eggs then it increases the chance that her daughter will do the same. Identical twins occur when a single egg splits in two and there is no scientific proof that this is hereditary so everyone had basically the same odds of having identical twins.</td>

Everyone has said don't use the bottle but they actually make bottles if you are transitioning your baby from milk to rice cereal as a first food. We tried this but the mix we made (2 tablespoon per 4 oz.)came out too fast. Now we just use a regular bottle and made a bigger hole in the nipple so it doesn't come out too fast but just enough. We stop to burp him if he eats it too fast and just let him digest it and not get his stomach so full so quickly, it might give him a tummy ache. Be careful, however, when making your own hole on the nipple, you don't want any part of the nipple to break off and be swallowed.</td>

<td>I just found out I am 11 weeks 'prego' with my 3rd. my 2nd is 7months, should I continue breatfeeding?</td>
<td>Some people (including some obstetricians) might tell you that you shouldn't nurse while you're pregnant, as it may harm your fetus. There is no need to worry about this unless you are severely malnourished (which you should never be, especially if you are pregnant or lactating). 
They might tell you that nursing during pregnancy might increase the risk of miscarriage. While it is true that nursing causes uterine contractions (due to the hormone oxytocin), there is no evidence that this may lead to a miscarriage. In fact, you will experience more severe uterine contractions during orgasm. If your doctor hasn't told you to avoid sex during pregnancy, nursing is perfectly safe too. If your doctor has told you to avoid sex, find out why. If uterine contractions are not among the reasons, then nursing is still safe. 
You might experience some breast and nipple tenderness during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. You need to decide whether you are willing to nurse anyway, or whether you would rather wean. If you choose to continue nursing, you can take some comfort in the fact that the tenderness is likely to decrease soon. If you wean, your child might want to resume nursing when the new baby is born. See tandem nursing before you make your decision. 
Some time during your pregnancy, your milk will decrease and its taste will change. It will eventually change into colostrum. Many toddlers wean themselves when this happens. Some, however, are happy to continue nursing. Either way, the decision to tandem nurse or not is yours.</td>

<td>My baby is 4 months old and I just started giving him cereal.  When can I add some fruit to it?</td>
<td>You can start Stage 1 fruits and veggies whenever you'd like, so long as you've fed him cereal long enough (usually three days is plenty of time) to be sure he's not having a reaction to it. Then introduce solids one at a time, for the same reason.

It IS preferable to wait until six months to introduce solids, but some babies just won't hold out that long. My pediatrician recommended starting my daughter on cereal and solids at four months as well, because the girl was nursing almost 24/7 and was still hungry. I'll definitely try to hold out (again) with my next child - but a hungry baby who is interested in solids is ready to start trying.

By the way, there is NO factual evidence supporting the thought that if you give your child fruits first that he won't accept vegetables later on. My pediatrician recommended pears and apples first, and to this day my two-year-old will turn up her nose at fruit in favor of broccoli or peas and carrots.</td>

<td>Help my baby wont swallow?</td>
<td>Baby is not swallowing yet because baby's development is not there yet.  Putting food onto the tongue and being able to move it down your throat is a skill that babies must learn, it is not 'known' instinctively by them.  Most nurses and doctors here (Vancouver Island) dont even suggest feeding baby cereal or anything other than formula or breast until bbay is almost a year, but sugggest waiting until at least 6months.

if baby is suckling all the time baby is encouraging milk flow, to build up your milk supply, that is a good sign, it means baby is growing, and is doing what nature needs it to do.  each time a baby suckles is not necessarily for food, sometimes it is to build up the supply for the next big 'growth spurt' sometimes it is just for comfort.  Perhaps try letting baby nurse for 15minutes then occupy baby with another activity, then when you nurse again switch sides for 15minutes....in between breast feeding, you could supplement baby's nursings with a bottle of formula, but I would encourage you to wait until after you have let baby nurse, so your milk supply doesnt get interupted.

Get the book "The No Cry Sleep Solution" by Elizabeth Pantley.  It will help guide you without having to deal with harsh cry-it-out methods of helping your baby sleep through the night. 

It worked for me.  I have a 9 month old and she has gone from several night wakings to maybe 1 or sometimes even none.  Also, please rule out any medical reasons for your baby waking up (ie teething, ear infection, etc).

(At least in New Mexico they do) Also day cares have certain regulations and rules they have to follow which is comforting because you know your child just isn't running wild all day long.

Serve him a small snack later possibly a cracker and piece of cheese.  Again if he refuses, follow through and serve dinner.  

If he's hungry he'll eat, toddlers won't starve themselves.  He may just be going through a period where he doesn't need as much food right now.  Lucky for you his foods of choice are good for him and will stick with him.  But I would avoid letting him have those and only those, if he has a bottle or sippy cup of milk round the clock he's bound to fill up and not be interested in trying anything else.

<td>It turns out sneezing a lot in babies is common, I was worried at first too but my pediatrician. told me it was normal. Babies are just getting used to the world. As for the dry skin, nothing works better than Aquaphor. Apply it right after you bathe baby, it'll lock in the moisture from the water and voila! no more dry skin, you must apply it every time you bathe the baby. You can also use Aquaphor calming creme, that's for in between bathes.
 Bathing your baby can be worrisome because they start screaming and crying, you should put the heater on in the house, even if you don't feel cold remember we have more body wieght and don't feel a breeze like a baby would. Make sure the water is warm and after you take the baby out, not only wrap the baby up in the baby towel but also a regular bath towel to keep baby warm. If you're baby is only a week old you don't have to sponge bath baby too often. Cleaning off diaper area with washcloth daily and face and hands would do it until the umbilical cord falls off.
The umbilical cord should fall off within 2-3 weeks after baby is born. Just remember to keep it dry and clean. Clean it with alcohol daily, at each diaper change. Most important remember to keep it clean and dry otherwise baby will get an infection!</td>

<td>how do i help my colicy baby??</td>
<td>Below are a few methods that may help make your baby feel more comfortable.  While a few of these methods may work with some babies, they may not work at all for others.

Keep a diary of when your baby cries, along with activities like napping, feeding and playing.  Look for patterns, which may offer a small clue to the solutions   

If you’re breast-feeding, try to eliminate dairy from your diet along with other foods such as onions, cabbage, cauliflower, spicy foods, caffeine, beans or other gas producing foods.  Before eliminating diary from your diet be sure to check with your doctor first.  Your doctor may or may not want you to eliminate dairy from your diet or he/she may want you to take calcium supplements 

If you’re bottle-feeding, do your best to reduce the amount of air that your baby swallows.  Try using a curved bottle or a bottle with collapsible disposable liners   

If your baby seems to have a lot of gas, make sure you burp him or her frequently   

Don’t overfeed your baby.  This may actually make the colic worse.  Stick to your normal feeding routine   

If you’re bottle-feeding talk with your doctor about changing formulas to a low-allergy type of formula   

Take your baby to a part of your home that will provide less stimulation.  Bright lights, noise, or a large number of people may further aggravate the colic   

Wrap your baby up snugly in a blanket while walking around in a smooth steady motion   

Go for a walk in a stroller or for a drive in a car seat   

Give your baby a warm bath or place a warm water bottle on your baby’s stomach.  Be sure the bottle is not hot! 

Try rocking in a rocking chair; or swinging in a baby swing   

Give your baby a gentle tummy massage   

Some baby’s like hearing rhythmic sounds such as a vacuum cleaner, dishwasher, or cloths dryer and will calm down when they hear these types of sounds</td>

<td>My baby is 7 months and throws tantrums when he doesn't get what he wants when he wants it, what to do?</td>
<td>Well it seems you have a normal baby on your hands...
Babies throw tantrums because their brains are immature and it is NOT because they are being bad or trying to make you angry.  They do not have the ability to try and make their parents angry...or to try and purposefully be bad-mannered.

You have to pick your battles.  Seven months is really young to try and start regular discipline, however, if the baby wants something that is inappropriate, i.e. a knife, then obviously you have to say no and ignore the tantrum.
If the baby is hungry and is throwing a fit because he wants to eat, then feed him.  

Other than ignoring the tantrums when he cries for something inappropriate, I would get into the habit of saying " I do not like it when you act this way" and then just walking away.  

My son is 17 months old, and he will throw tantrums because he wants to get up on the kitchen counters.  I obviously do not allow him to do this.  I ease him to the floor, and let him throw his little fit.  I don't make a big deal about it.

I also have a daughter who is eleven years old.  She had temper fits as a baby as well.  But, as a 3 year old and up to eleven, she NEVER had temper tantrums..  I could take her anywhere, anytime.

Set your standards high as a parent and teach by example.
I think that is the best way to raise happy healthy kids.

<td>The American Association of Paediatrics recommends feeding babies breast milk for the first six months. After that, you can start feeding them baby food together with breast milk. Once they turn one, you can start moving towards a totally solid diet. You might seek to feed them solid food in the day and breast milk at night. You should be prepared to be flexible depending on how your kids go.</td>

<td>How do you stop a collicy baby 4 weeks old from screaming?</td>
<td>My hubby and I thought our baby was colicky but it might be just needing to cry. Anyway, we've had our nights where he needed a big cry but we learned that what you try might not work the first time, so try it again. Babies change their minds all the time with what makes them happy and eventually you figure out something that makes them happy almost all the time. LOL

I'll just mention the many things that we've tried to calm him:

Playing music and swaying him around (this worked early on)
Putting him in the swing (that works more now but sometimes he doesn't like it)
Swaddling him and sometimes putting a pacifier in his mouth (this works best for us lately)
Laying him on the changing table whether it's to change his diaper or not (calms him down for some reason)
Going for a car ride
Bath


Just never give up with each thing you try right away, give it a chance, your baby might be so busy crying, he/she may shut out everything momentarily.

And when your baby cries and cries and you are going crazy just set him/her down somewhere safe (crib most likely) and let them cry for a bit so you can chill. It never helps to be so wound up like that...babies pick up on it.</td>

for zucchini related: 

Ingredients 
1/2 cup (125 ml) uncooked Uncle Ben's brown rice 

1 cup (250 ml) water 

1 lb (440 g) of tender meat (filet mignon, lamb, or veal) 

1 tsp. (5 ml) olive oil 

2 cups (500 ml) water 

3/4 cup (200ml) onion chopped fine (approx. 1/2 of 1 med onion) 

3/4 cup (200ml) carrots cubed or chopped fine (approx. 1) 

3/4 cup (200ml) zucchini (with peel, remove ends) cubed or chopped fine (approx. 1) 

3/4 cup (200ml) frozen peas 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preparation 
In a small pot, stir brown rice into 1 cup water. Bring to boil, then cover and lower heat to simmer approx. 20 min. The rice is now half cooked. Set aside. 

Cut the meat into pieces about 2" square. After 20 min, take a larger pot and cook the meat in the olive oil until it is brown on all sides, about 5 min. Add 2 cups of water, the vegetables (onion, carrots, zucchini, and frozen peas), and the half-cooked rice. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the vegetables are tender and the rice is completely cooked, approx. 26 min. 

Remove from heat and allow to cool down a bit so that you can handle the meat. Pick out the meat pieces and cut into smaller pieces, cubed or chopped fine. Add back to the rest of the mixture and stir so that the meat is evenly distributed. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Freeze 
Put half a cup (8 tbsp) of cooked food into an 8 oz breastmilk storage bag. Roll the top down and seal with a staple in the middle. Repeat until all of the food is now in the nursing bags. Put all of the bags into a large Ziploc freezer bag and label the large bag with the type of food (beef , veggies, and rice or veal, veggies and rice, etc), the serving size, and the date that the food was made. This will keep 10 -12 weeks in the freezer. Each recipe yields approx. 12 servings. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Cook 
Remove frozen meal from Playtex bag and place in microwavable dish. Microwave on High for approx. 1 min 40 sec. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tips 
If your baby refuses to eat, try adding 2 tbsp of prepared baby food. This acts like a sauce and babies love it. 

For babies who cannot chew yet, puree the food before freezing and freeze in 4 oz portions.

<td>What about the Baby Einstein DVD's?</td>
<td>You should buy them! They are great for a baby to watch. Very colorful and educational. I bought one when my son was almost a year old and he was fascinated with it. He is 4 years old now and still watches them. He has an incredible love for music. He can even hum or "la-la" tunes from classical pieces that he hears on the videos. Even if he is not watching them. I would start off with Baby Mozart. That was my son's favorite, until it stopped working because he watched it so much (VHS).</td>

<td>what should be an average size of a one year old baby?</td>
<td>It depends on a few things...Sex of baby, Color of baby and how much it weighed when born.  Reason for sex of baby is that girls tend to be littler and boys bigger.  Color of baby depends on if your child is white vs Black.  Black babies tend to be bigger(this is not a racist repsonse).  When you take your child in for their 1 year check up ask your doctor what growth range he/she is in.  This will tell you the progress of your child and if he/she is getting what they need in foods and excersize. The average baby at 1 year is 23 1/2 lbs for girls and 24 1/2 lbs for boys. but my son was small when he was born and really grew during his first year. When he was a year old he was wearing 18 month clothes and weighed 22-25lbs.  It just depends on your own child.

I hope that she can live a life from here on out that is worthy of her child.  My philosophy is that people should be forgiven for their mistakes (regardless of whether they are sorry), but that does not mean that they can have the same level of trust placed in them.  This woman did something so abusive that it was likely to kill her baby.  For that reason returning the child to the mother would be poor judgement.  I used to be a foster care worker and it was heartbreaking to see parents lose their children, but we HAVE to protect these children.  They cannot protect themselves.</td>

<td>I am going to assume that your baby is still on breastmilk or formula, because she should be by all means.
Until your baby is a year old eating food is really just practice for the real deal.  She gets all of her important nutrients and vitamins from her formula or breastmilk.
Wait a few weeks and try a veggie again.  I started my baby with green beans.  Only try giving her green beans once a day for about a week or two.  Then go to another vegetable.  All the articles I have read on this topic say that it can take up to twenty times of introducing a new food before a baby will eat it.
Most importantly, dont stress out about it.  You sound like a wonderful mother to be concerned and wanting your baby to eat well.  She will...just slow down and don't worry.
Good luck!</td>

I bought a lot of the Stage 3 baby foods back then (especially for dinners), Gerber Graduates (they seem to be a bit more filling than even the Stage 3s), lots of finely chopped fruits and veggies (she still loves crushed pineapple, and it's so handy from a can), very small pieces of cheese - basically 'adult' food, just in very tiny pieces. I tried to feed her a large variety of foods then, and she's not at all a picky eater now. Peas and carrots are her favorite food. :)

If you get the baby on a routine it is easy.
My Son is almost 2 and has been sleeping through the night since he was 10 weeks old.
I even put him to bed wide awake right now, and he goes to sleep on his own.
If your baby wakes up and cries in the middle of the night, give it 10 minutes before you go rushing in.  They are shouting to see if you will come when they call for no reason.  If you lose control now on something little like this, then you will not have control when they get older because they will know what button to push.
You should know what scream is for no reason and what scream is "HELP!!!" by now.
For a baby that young try this:
Eat.  Play.  Sleep.
Don't let them sleep ON you.  Don't let them sleep IN your bed.  Train them to sleep alone in their own bed.
Feed them.  Play a little.  Then put them to bed.  Don't let them get in the habit of falling asleep while feeding.
It's all about a routine.
My son knows at night it's:
Dinner.
Play.
Bath and/or Jammies time.
Milk.
Brush Teeth.
Bed time.
All I have to do now if it is not bath night is say "Lets go get your Jammies on" and he runs to the bedroom.
It really is all about a routine.</td>

but before i'd do it, i'd test it out on your boy during the day to make sure he doesn't move too much b/c if it comes off from around his neck, and he moves too much, he could choke...my girl never had any problems and it kept her binky in really well...but the elastic material that i bought made for making the lace stretchy so she had less chances of choking...i started her at 2 months and she still does fine with it...
if you don't feel comfortable with it on during the night, just wait until he's asleep and then gently take it off him..

I honestly wouldn't go by someone saying to feed your child 5 times a day or only when it cries, or feed your child 6 ounces at every feeding, etc.  This is something that you really should be discussing with your childs pediatrian.

<td>how do you keep a child from getting sick?</td>
<td>Hmm, not easy to say.

First of all: have you discussed this with your pediatrition? Maybe ther is a medical reason for a weakened immune system? check this out first.

Otherwise there are simple rules to prevent (up to a point) your child from getting sick:

1. He should keep a head on, even in the spring, when the air seems warm but the ground is cold.

2. If he was sweating don NOT take everything of, because then he will become very quickly cold and the swet is wet on his skin and it makes him freeze and catch a cold

3. I dont know how sick your boy was, but just a runny nose throughout all winter is quite healthy thing, as it keeps the immune system on guard and prevents worse infections

4. Dont let him sit or crawl on the cold floor in the winter and in the spring when its really warm (!) put a blanket out for him!

5. In the pram he is much colder than you are because you move and he sits still and he gets all the wind from the driving in his face: put a very warm blanket around him. Indicators if he is warm or cold are alway his hands or better his nose.

6. Put him enough close on and y cloth around the neck. Children are cooling aout much easie than adults (like amouse freezes quicker than an elephant), therefor if you were no jacket because you would be sweating with one that does not mean your boy can do the same. He needs to be dressed alwasy warmer than you. Check his nose when you go out.

7. fresh air is healthy: go out a lot but kkep him warm.


So, you probbably knew all that anyway, but I thought I share it with you nevertheless.

Remeber that your child will always get sick, especially at the cold season, you can not prevent that at all.

Check with your doc nevertheless.

All the best to you and your son</td>

<td>what should i do if my baby have colic?</td>
<td>I would get a second opionion to rule out reflux, that sounds a lot more like what your baby has than colic. Colic is usually just a period of non stop crying, usually in the evening where the baby cannot be quieted for several hours. The spit up and burping problems sound more like a reflux problem and if he's not keeping in enough nourishment he will cry from hunger and be unable to sleep, not to mention he'll be in pain from the acid reflux as well.


Gastroesophageal Reflux (Acid Reflux) in Infants
From Sharon Gillson,

Symptoms and Diagnosis of Acid Reflux / GERD
Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) occurs when stomach contents come back up into the esophagus (the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach) during or after a meal. A ring of muscle at the bottom of the esophagus opens and closes to allow food to enter the stomach. This ring of muscle is called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This sphincter opens to release gas (burping) after meals in normal infants, children, and adults. When the sphincter opens in infants, the stomach contents often go up the esophagus and out the mouth (spitting up or vomiting). GER can also occur when babies cough, cry, or strain. Most infants with GER are happy and healthy even though they spit up or vomit. 



Symptoms of Acid Reflux in Infants
GER occurs often in normal infants. More than half of all babies experience reflux in the first 3 months of life. 
An infant with GER may experience:
  •spitting
  •vomiting
  •coughing
  •irritability
  •poor feeding
  •blood in the stools 
Only a small number of infants have severe symptoms due to GER. Most infants stop spitting up between the ages of 12 to 18 months. 

In a small number of babies, GER may result in symptoms that are of concern. These include problems such as:
  •poor growth due to an inability to hold down enough food
  •irritability or refusing to feed due to pain
  •blood loss from acid burning the esophagus
  •breathing problems 

These problems can be caused by disorders other than GER. Your health care provider needs to determine if GER is causing your child's symptom(s). 


Diagnosis of Acid Reflux in Infants
An infant who spits or vomits may have GER. The doctor or nurse will talk with you about your child's symptoms and will examine your child. If the infant is healthy, happy, and growing well, no tests or treatment may be needed. Tests may be ordered to help determine whether your child's symptoms are related to GER. Sometimes, treatment is started without tests.

<td>what is the best daycare in sandusky ohio?</td>
<td>Hi
I don't live there so I can't say from that point of veiw. However, some tips on a good daycare are:
Look for:

Rounded table corners and other furniture safety features. 
Non-toxic play materials. 
First aid kit. 
Healthy snacks and/or meals. 
Clean kitchen area. 
Handwashing after toileting and before meals and snacks. 
Separate cribs for infants and separate cots/mats for others. 
Cleaning materials, medicines out of reach of children.

Program
Proper child-staff ratios. 
Creative Play. 
Plenty of play materials. 
Plenty of educational materials. 
Organized program of activities. 
Supervised rest time. 
Minimal, supervised TV if any. 
Stories read.

General

Rules clearly explained. 
Good behavior encouraged.

No children "left out". 
Lots of laughing, caring, sharing. 
HAPPY CHILDREN!

Ask these questions:

May I drop in anytime? 
May I participate in program planning? 
May I take part in special events and trips? 
What are the hours? 
What are the fees? 
What does this include? 
Is there a reduction in fee if my child is out sick? 
What happens if my child gets sick or injured at the center? 
Are the caregivers trained in child development? 
What are the hiring procedures? 
How long has most staff worked here? 
May I contact staff references? 
Is there a parents' group or program? 
Are there restrictions on who may pick up my child?

Ask yourself:

Is the center conveniently located? 
Is the center affordable? 
Do I feel comfortable with the caregivers? 
Do I feel good watching my child play at this center? 
Do I feel that the center is right for my child and myself?
Try to:

Set up a "trial day" when your child can join in activities while you observe.
After your child begins attending:

Drop in unannounced and visit regularly. 
Leave emergency contact information with the caregiver. 
Set up two or three "back-up plans" in case or your child's or your illness. 
Get involved with your child's day care experience!</td>

"Pinkish milk may indicate blood in the milk. This could occur with or without cracked nipples. If cracked nipples are the cause of blood in the milk, a mother can contact a La Leche League Leader for suggestions on healing sore nipples. Blood in milk is not harmful to babies, and breastfeeding can continue. If blood in the milk does not cease by two weeks postpartum, the mother may wish to consult with her health care provider."</td>

I went to rehab several times before, but always relapsed because I had no desire to stay clean, no reason to. I was ready to keep digging the hole deeper. When I got pregnant I was homeless, and didn't give a sh*t about myself. When I found I was pregnant, I went to rehab, got clean, found a job, a place to live (all with help of my sponsor), and haven't touched the stuff since. He's now 4. If it weren't for him I think I'd be dead today. He gave me my reason to live. He really brought things into prospective, and I knew I didn't want to f*ck his life up like I had mine, so it was about time I turn things around. I went through culinary arts school and got my degree, and I probably never would've done that if he hadn't come along, and I'm buying a house now to provide a more permanant home for my family (well husband and I are, got married and had another son lol). I have everything I never would've had if I kept on the road I was going down, and it was all due to him.</td>

<td>Is it normal for a 5 month old child to begin crawling?</td>
<td>When it comes to normal and babies I think those two words just don't go together. But it all depends on your child. If your child spend tons of time on the floor and on there belly they are more aware of there space and body, which in return can have your child starting to do things earlier than others. But if your child is confined to swings, bouncers and strollers then there poor little bodies are not getting the exercise that they need for walking, crawling and sitting up on there own. My son is about to turn 6 months on the 21th and he can roll just about anywhere, and can sit up by himself with almost no support and now he is working on the crawling and he is always on the floor. So it just depends on your child and how strong he/she is.


PS: Don't worry if your little one does not crawl at all some children skip crawling althogether or stick to another from of getting around. As long as your child is making some attempt to get around they are ok. And crawling is not even on the list on milestones because of the differnce in when it is done in all babies.</td>

I know this sounds wrong, and it will break your heart to listen to your baby cry, but is a way to show them some independence.

<td>I was severly lactose intolerant when i was a baby, my mom has told me horror stories from when i was little, she told me that she would give me yogurt alot. i guess the enzimes in the yogurt was good for me, my doc told her to do it. when everyone was eating ice cream i was eating frozen yogurt or surbert. I could have milk made out of dry milk, it was discusting though lol from what i remember, i suffered with this till i hit puberty for the most part. But for the most part right now you just have to make sure you get the calcuim in your child. From me not being able to have Milk products, my teeth arent strong at all, im always seeing the dentist, My advice to you is to talk to a nutritionalist about what you can give your baby to replace what he might not get, i know that similac makes a milk free fomula called isomil, there are cheeses out there that arnt made from cows milk, like soy instead... there are all sorts of products out there made from soy instead, read labels carfully when giving him processed foods, now they make this convient by labeling what has milk in it and what doesnt, but definitally talk to a nutritionalist about what you can give your baby to make sure he gets the calcuim he needs! Trust me on this! :P</td>

Fisher Price and some party stores sell these spinner things - they are like globes on a stick that have spinning lights inside. We used those, too. But you have to put it away the minute you are done with the diaper so it's special for diaper changes.

<td>my baby heartbeat rate is 127. Can i know from this sex of my baby. How to find baby sex from 7th month scan.?</td>
<td>As for the heart beat story...A MYTH:  A baby girl's heart rate is usually faster than a boy's, but only after the onset of labor. There's no difference between fetal heart rates for boys and girls, but the rate does vary with the age of the fetus. By approximately the fifth week of pregnancy, the fetal heart rate is near the mother's - around 80 to 85 BPM. It continues to accelerate until early in the ninth week, when it reaches 170 to 200 BPM and then decelerates to an average of 120 to 160 BPM by the middle of the pregnancy. Normal fetal heart rate during labor ranges from 120 to 160 BPM for boys and girls.  http://kidshealth.org/parent/general/aches/old_wives_tales.html    Someone's midwife predicted the sex of your baby?  So what....they had a fifty-fifty chance of getting it right!  lol

As for ultrasound, by the 7th month, it can be very difficult to see the sex of the baby.  By this time, the baby has gotten large enough that the baby is all curled up.  When the baby doesn't have as much room to stretch out, it can be difficult to determine sex.  Also, by the 7th month, the bones of the baby have calcified to such a degree that it hampers the ultrasound.  Ultrasound cannot see through bone.  If fact, the bone will cause a "shadow" so that everything behind, or below, the bone will be impossible to see.  The best time for sexing a fetus is between weeks 18-24 or so.....if the baby wants to cooperate!</td>

<td>How can I dry up my breast milk?</td>
<td>If you stop breastfeeding, your milk will dry.  If you don't use it, you will lose it.

If you're feeling a slight engorgement, or if milk is leaking and annoying you, you can try putting fresh green cabbage leaves over your breasts to help dry up the milk supply.

Wash the leaves, crush them slightly and place them over your breasts inside your bra. Change them when they wilt, but leave them on around-the-clock for 48 hours or so. Drinking two to three cups of sage tea a day will also help dry up your milk. Or, you can just wait and let nature take its course.

Breast pads can help control wetness but they won't do anything to diminish your milk supply. Whatever you do, don't pump routinely. If your breasts are uncomfortably full, you can certainly pump once to empty your breasts completely, and make yourself more comfortable. After that, only pump if you get really miserable, and then pump only for comfort.  http://www.babycenter.com/expert/baby/babybreastfeed/8921.html

If you let nature take its course, in a week to ten days, your breasts will typically dry up and feel like they did before pregnancy. Most women find they are most uncomfortable when their milk comes in — around day three after delivery. There are some measures you can take, though, to ease the discomfort caused by engorgement and hurry the process along. 
• Wear a snug-fitting bra to "bind" your breasts.
• Avoid nipple stimulation, which encourages your breasts to produce milk.
• Don't pump, even to relieve engorgement — it encourages milk production.
• Apply cold compresses to your breasts a couple of times a day.
• Place a large, fresh, slightly crushed green cabbage leaf inside each of your bra cups, changing the leaves when they wilt, until your breasts are soft again (it may take 48 hours or so). No one knows for sure why cabbage leaves are so soothing. Some lactation experts speculate that there's an anti-inflammatory agent in cabbage that helps ease pain and reduce swelling.
• Drink two to three cups of sage tea each day (sage discourages milk production).
• Take a mild pain reliever such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, as needed.

The adoptive mothers I've spoken to who nurse their babies say that pumping before the baby came helped and that it was best to do so with a picture of a baby in front of them.  When you have your baby, you might consider an SNS system to use to feed formula or donated breastmilk, and continue to pump.  The best thing you can do is also the easiest, spend lots and lots of time with your new baby.  I hope the whole process goes smoothly and easily for you!</td>

Then, look through your ideas and cross out anything that isn't pro or con.

After you narrow that down, you will make 2 columns. One column is pro and the other con.  Fill in your keeper ideas under the proper heading.

After you do that, you will need to come up with your main topics...I. Pros; II. Cons.  Get your sub topics based on major themes.  IE. costs, socialization, educational...whatever.

Then, it's over.  No more passie.

My last child was a problem.  I allowed her to have it until she was five because she had medical problems and it was a good way to, well, pacify her.  On her fifth birthday she woke up, handed the pacifier to her 10 year old brother, and said, "I'm five now.  I don't need this."  It was that simple and it was over.  

However, during the day when it was nap time, she looked at me and said, "I'm five.  I don't need a nap."  

"Yeah, you're probably right," I said.  "A girl who doesn't need a pacifier doesn't need a nap."  That may have helped reinforce the separation.  Who knows?  At least it's over.</td>

<td>NORMAL DIET FOR INFANTS - 0 TO 12 MONTHS
GENERAL INFORMATION: 

What is it? 

Giving your baby the right amounts and the right kinds of foods during his first year is very important. A good diet will protect him against disease, and can help him grow. Eating helps your baby develop skills like using utensils and cups. It can be a special time you and your family spend getting to know the new baby.


Your baby needs regular check-ups to make sure he is growing and gaining the right amount of weight. Make sure to keep all of your baby's appointments. Call your baby's caregiver if your baby has diarrhea or vomiting for more than a day. This may mean he is not able to digest the milk or food you are giving him. If your baby does not drink breast milk or formula for more than 1 day, call your baby's caregiver. 

Care: 

What should I feed my baby from birth to 4 months? 

Milk is the only food that your baby needs for the first four months. You may choose to breastfeed or bottle-feed your baby. Wake your baby to feed him if he sleeps longer than 4-5 hours. Never let your baby sleep through a feeding when he is younger than 4 weeks old. You may feed your baby at set time periods, like every 3 hours. Or, you can let your baby tell you when he wants to eat by crying and in other ways. Some people use both these ways to feed their baby. Your baby will usually stop feeding when he gets enough milk.


The amount of milk your baby takes should slowly increase from 2-4 months of age. Your baby will go through periods where he will grow faster than other times. These periods usually happen within the first 4 weeks of age. You may need to feed him more often at these times. He may also need more food at each feeding to satisfy him. Ask your caregiver for the CareNotes™ handout on Normal Growth and Development of Infants. This will explain how the average baby grows over one year. 

Should I feed my baby every time he cries? Babies cry for many reasons, and often it is because they are hungry. But, your baby may be crying because he wants to be comforted or held. Or he may want his diaper changed or has tummy pain. Your baby may be bored and wants someone to talk and play with him. Try to comfort your baby before feeding him if it is not time for a feeding. You may be giving your baby too much by feeding him every time he cries. Listen to and learn your baby's signals. With time and if you are patient, you will be able to tell what your baby needs.

How do I know if my baby is getting enough to eat? The following are signs that your baby may not be getting enough breast milk or formula. 

Crying much of the time.


Not gaining enough weight.


Not sleeping very much or very often.


Skin may look loose or wrinkly after the first week of age.


Skin that looks more yellow after the first week. (It should look less yellow).


Wetting less than 4 diapers per day, and having less than one stool per day. 

What should I know about breast-feeding? When you are pregnant, your body spends the nine months getting ready to feed your baby. Human milk is specially made for your baby. It has the perfect combination of nutrients (new-tree-unts) for your baby. Nutrients include protein, fat, carbohydrates (car-bo-hi-drates), vitamins, and minerals your baby needs. These help your baby's body and brain grow. Always wash your hands well before breastfeeding your baby. Ask your caregiver for the CareNotes™ handout on breast-feeding.

How do I know if my baby is getting enough breast milk? 

The amount of breast milk you produce depends on how much your baby is taking from you. The more your baby drinks, the more milk will be produced. At 4-5 days after your baby is born, your breasts should feel full, large, firm, heavy and warm. They may also leak. Your breasts should feel full before feedings and softer after. Milk "let-down" is a feeling you may have just before you breastfeed. Yo</td>

<td>Is it me or what?</td>
<td>This is the time when most infants are introduced to solid foods. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) currently recommends gradually introducing solid foods when a baby is about 6 months old. Your doctor, however, may recommend starting as early as 4 months depending on your baby's readiness and nutritional needs. Be sure to check with your doctor before starting any solid foods.

Your baby may take a little while to "learn" how to eat solids. During these months you'll still be providing the usual feedings of breast milk or formula, so don't be concerned if your baby refuses certain foods at first, or doesn't seem very interested in food. It may just take some time.

Is My Child Is Ready to Eat Solids?
How can you tell if your baby is ready for solids? Here are a few hints:

Is your baby's tongue-thrust reflex gone or diminished? This reflex, which prevents infants from choking on foreign objects, also causes them to push food out of their mouths. 
Can your baby support his or her own head? To eat solid food, an infant needs good head and neck control and should be able to sit up. 
Is your baby interested in food? A 6-month-old baby who stares and grabs at your food at dinnertime is clearly ready for some variety in the food department. 
If your doctor gives the go-ahead but your baby seems frustrated or uninterested as you're introducing solid foods, try waiting a few days or even weeks before trying again. Since solids are only a supplement at this point, breast milk and formula will still fill your baby's basic nutritional needs.

How Should I Start Feeding My Baby Solids?
When your baby is ready and the doctor has given you the OK to try solid foods, pick a time of day when your baby is not tired or cranky. You want your baby to be a little hungry, but not all-out starving; you might want to let your baby breastfeed a while, or provide part of the usual bottle. Have your baby sit supported in your lap or in an upright infant seat. Infants who sit well, usually around 6 months, can be placed in a high chair with a safety strap.

Typically, a baby's first food is a little iron-fortified infant rice cereal mixed with breast milk or formula. The first feeding may be nothing more than a little cereal mixed in a whole lot of liquid. Place the spoon near your baby's lips, and let the baby smell and taste. Don't be surprised if this first spoonful is rejected. Wait a minute and try again. Most food offered to your baby at this age will end up on the baby's chin, bib, or high-chair tray. Again, this is just an introduction.

Do not add cereal to your baby's bottle unless your child's doctor instructs you to do so, as this can cause babies to become overweight and doesn't help the baby learn how to eat solid foods.

Once your infant gets the hang of eating cereal off a spoon, it may be time to introduce a fruit or vegetable. When introducing new foods, go slow. Introduce one food at a time and wait several days before trying something else new. This will allow you to identify foods that your baby may be allergic to.


Foods to Avoid for Now
Some foods are generally withheld until later. Do not give eggs, cow's milk, citrus fruits and juices, and honey until after a baby's first birthday.

Eggs (especially the whites) may cause an allergic reaction, especially if given too early. Citrus is highly acidic and can cause painful diaper rashes for a baby. Honey may contain certain spores that, while harmless to adults, can cause botulism in babies. Regular cow's milk does not have the nutrition that infants need.

Fish and seafood, peanuts and peanut butter, and tree nuts are also considered allergenic for infants, and shouldn't be given until after the child is 2 or 3 years old, depending on whether the child is at higher risk for developing food allergies.

<td>My baby is always fussy in public.?</td>
<td>Ahh! Sounds a lot like my son! LOL He's 3 months old and he was very fussy in the first couple months. He still is but I think he is getting better the older he gets. The more they get intuned to the world around them and the more they start to get interested in toys and their hands then they get better. 

Hubby and I are now just going with his schedule. We let him take his nap, then he eats, and then we figure he is good for about an hour before he gets fussy again. I don't know if you have your child on any kind of schedule but the sooner you figure what makes him happy for a little while take the opportunity to bring him where ever you need to go. 

Also, there may be things you can do to settle down your child. Feeding her where ever you are or having her swaddled with a pacifier...that calms down my son like nothing else. 

Good luck!</td>

<td>What is the best way to introduce my 6 month old to solid foods and not just the bottle?</td>
<td>Start with once a day feeding her rice cereal.  She won't like it at first, but she will get used to it.  Mix it with breastmilk or formula, not just water, so she will be used to the taste.

After she is eating a full serving of cereal for two weeks, move on to her first fruit or vegetable. (Stage 1).  Feed her this once a day (along with the rice cereal at the same time, but not mixed) for a full week to make sure she does not have a bad reaction.  Then you can move on to twice a day as soon as you want.  

Move on to the next baby food, one week at a time.  You can feed her one she already knows too, but only introduce a new one once a week.  Once she goes through all the Stage 1 fruits and vegetables, move on the that Stage 2 meats and other fruits and veggies.

Don't be discouraged if she doesn't eat something.  She might not like green beans at first and will not take another bite after the first one.  Don't push her, just offer her the same food again the next day.  By the end of the week (or two if you want), she will get used to the taste.</td>

<td>Do you let your baby cry it out?</td>
<td>i think that it depends on whether or not it's because they are over tired, or not tired enough, maybe start a ritual before their bedtime and make sure you are consistent...i promise it will work if you keep at it no matter how tired you are. maybe the time at which you want to put them down is too late also. set the bedtime a lil earlier. (30 min). try not to play too close to their bedtime because that might overstimulate them. keep it quiet and calm and soothing. 

Here's the ritual i've created for both my girls and it worked for me the first time (although harder to remain consistent) and now with my 8 month old. both times it took a while, but in the end...my goodness...what a relief it is to have a lil time to myself to regroup for another day.

ok first...at around 7:45 pm (depending on the baby) i get her bath water ready. she takes a bath for AT LEAST 15 min. just soaking in really warm water. the loger she's in the bath the warmer i make it by adding hot water gradually. after that i massage her with lotion and change her into some warm jammies. i make her a bottle and lay her down in her crib (now) before i'd hold her until she fell asleep. about 15 min. 

try it, but YOUR way, depending on your baby. if all else fails, i've let both my girls cry, and they're alright. i know it took awhile to actually answer your question, but i'm hoping that maybe you wont have such a dilemma like this especially at bedtime. during the day...i let mine cry if i knew they were ok. i tried to prevent the crying at night though. 

good luck...they are so worth it.</td>

<td>when do babys eyes change  to there proper colour.?</td>
<td>Eye color can and does change in some people throughout their lives. The iris of the eye (the colored part) contains melanocytes, the same cells which cause "tanning" in the skin. People with light-colored eyes have fewer melanocytes, and those with darker eyes have more, in much the same way as people with lighter or darker skin have different amounts of melanocytes. This also accounts for the fact that some people have differences in their eye color as the seasons change. Having said this, most people seem to have a relatively stable eye color throughout their lives, and this eye color is attained at a relatively young age -- usually in the preschool years.</td>

as for you not taking care of yourself, I think you're subconsciously answering your own question.  you are neglecting yourself in proxy for neglecting your unborn child.  wake up and take care of yourself before you start to seriously impact your own health and that of the baby.

I'm not a right wing family values nutjob conservative.  I think you are right to question whether or not you should really keep the baby.  if you wait much longer to decide, abortion is going to become a non-option and you'll have to at least carry the baby to term before you can make a choice.  sit down with your parents, your bf, your religious authority, your doctor - whomever you think is going to help you make a choice.  and then decide.  and quickly.  you don't have tons of time.</td>

<td>Heard that cabbage is good for drying up breast milk. If ture How do you do it?</td>
<td>I have never tried this method, in fact never heard about until about a week ago.  This is what the experts say:

If you're feeling a slight engorgement, or if milk is leaking and annoying you, you can try putting fresh green cabbage leaves over your breasts to help dry up the milk supply.

Wash the leaves, crush them slightly and place them over your breasts inside your bra. Change them when they wilt, but leave them on around-the-clock for 48 hours or so. Drinking two to three cups of sage tea a day will also help dry up your milk. Or, you can just wait and let nature take its course.

Breast pads can help control wetness but they won't do anything to diminish your milk supply. Whatever you do, don't pump routinely. If your breasts are uncomfortably full, you can certainly pump once to empty your breasts completely, and make yourself more comfortable. After that, only pump if you get really miserable, and then pump only for comfort. http://www.babycenter.com/expert/baby/ba...</td>

<td>Germans measure infant sizes by centimeters.  It makes sense and is easy once you get used to it.  Before it is confusing.  But basically:
US newborn size is 58 German
US preemie is 52 German
US 0-3 months is 58-62 German
US 3-6 months is 64 (?) - 72 German
Us 6-9 months is 72- 82 German
US 9-12 months is 82-86 German

These are just approximate, but will give you an idea.   My kids were short, so it helped me to pick my centimeter rather than age group.  but they are close.  Have fun.</td>

<td>what age do children start sleeping in beds instead of a crib?</td>
<td>It really depends on other factors. My first it was 18 months, but now with my 4th she is 15 months and not walking. They need to know how to turn around and go down stairs, slide off the couch on their tummy, etc. They will need to know how to get out of the bed with out falling on their head. How are they at going to bed? Do you have to coax them or are they good at going down on their own? Cause once you take them out of the crib it is really hard. You need to teach them good sleeping skills while in the crib so that it is an easier adjustment moving out of the crib. Also are they sleeping through the night? Because not being in a crib might get them coming in your bed and wandering the house at night. I just know that every kid is SO different. They mature at different rates, watch and see and as their parent you will know. But I would say average is anywhere from 18 months-2 1/2 yrs. I know it is a big gap, but kids are so different. Good Luck and I hope it is a great transition.</td>

If you truly felt that your baby would be raised better elsewhere, then you did the best thing for your baby. You cared enough to leave your child with the father, which is more than many people do for their children. Be sure to make your legal arrangements for custody and support to avoid abandonment charges later on.

<td>How old was your baby when you first fed him/her babyfood?</td>

My son HATED all vegetables or "meals" of baby food. he liked the fruits and he'd eat cereal if it was mixed with fruit.  I didn't like only feeding him fruit (I wasted a lot of baby food that he wouldn't eat on him) so when he was 8 mos old and could eat finger food I quit buying baby food.

Some people start later due to possible allergies, and plus some babies don't really want to eat any solid foods.  Some people start at 4 mos which is the "minimum" age they recommend, but I don't think it's good to stress the baby's digestive system by introducing it that young. I probably would've waited even later to start if my kids weren't throwing tantrums about wanting to try food too.</td>

<td>i have breast feeding problem,i'm in pain everytime when i breast feed help!?</td>
<td>I assume this is your first child...

I had similar issues. It was so painful, that I used to  just SOB during feedings. I wanted to breastfeed so badly, but ultimately, I had to stop for a short while. (Emphasis on the word SHORT...)

It's highly possible that your nipples may be bruised. You may need to take a break or at least cut way back from breastfeeding TEMPORARILY. I suggest cutting back to once or twice a day, for just a few days, to give your nipples a chance to heal. If you choose to take this advice, and don't already have one, it's extremely important that you get your hands on a breast pump, so you can still give your baby your breast milk, and so you will continue to produce. (Some people warn against "nipple confusion" with giving your baby a bottle some of the time, but I didn't experience any problems with it.) I strongly suggest an electric pump. You'll be back to feeding full-time before you know it. Also, keep using cream to guard against cracking &amp; bleeding again, once you start breastfeeding again. 

Also, make sure that your baby is taking ALL of your nipple. If they are only taking the tip, you will continue to get bruised. I know it seems like it's too much skin, for such a tiny mouth, but its not, I promise. Milk comes from the ENTIRE nipple, not just the tip.

It can be a real challenge, but hang in there, you'll get it! Congratulations on your committment to stick with it. Many women have given up by now. Don't give up, and the two of you will be a breastfeeding team in no time! You will be SO glad you did. It is SO WORTH IT! You can do it!

I hope this is helpful! God Bless You &amp; Best wishes!</td>

<td>What is the best position for a baby to sleep?</td>
<td>Please do not listen to the people saying on the side.  BACK TO SLEEP is a campaign from the SIDS alliance.  Babies don't choke while laying the back.  Babies are smart they turn their head and drool.  Babies could accidentally roll over to their face if they are put on their side.  I know your probably thinking a little baby can't roll but they do like to migrate.  Babies like boundaries.  It makes them feel like they are still in the womb. Even the tiny babies in the neonatal ICU migrate in their cribs.  Place your baby on it's back and roll a baby blanket and place it on either side of your baby.  If your baby is prone to reflux, you can always put him in an infant seat to sleep.   Here are some other ways to stop SIDS:
 1) Do not smoke around the baby.  Go outside.  By smoking in another room, the baby  can still potentially inhale the second hand smoke through the ventilation system.
 2)Don't over dress your baby.  Baby should have one more layer than you are wearing.  
 3) No bumper pads or stuffed animals in the crib that could fall on baby and suffocate them.  Bumper pads were used so baby wouldn't get it's arm or leg caught between the slots.  Now cribs make the slots closer together. 
 
I know this went above and beyond the question but I am a pediatric nurse and we teach this to new parents all the time.  It could save your babies life. Remember BACK TO SLEEP.</td>

Bacterial pneumonias tend to be the most serious cause of pneumonia. The most common pneumonia-causing bacterium in children is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus).
...Respiratory viruses rank high among the causes of pneumonia in young children, peaking between the ages of 2 and 3. 
By school age, the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae becomes more infectious. Bacterial pneumonia may follow influenza or even a common cold.
Some children can contract pneumonia while being treated in a hospital for other conditions. This tends to be more serious because the child's immune system is often impaired due to the condition that initially required treatment. In addition, there is a greater possibility of infection with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.</td>

She didn't always cry with her dad, but she usually cried with men she didn't know or didn't see often, like her uncles and grandfathers.  

I remember thinking that it was odd, but I assumed that it was just comfort of the bosom and the fact that women are more relaxed and comfortable when they hold babies than men are.  Sometimes men tense up like they're afraid they are going to drop the baby or something.

We didn't push her to be held by men, although grandpa always held her for a minute or so until she started to cry.  She eventually grew out of it, and showed no preference afterward.</td>

<td>how do you get a baby to play on their belly when he/she fusses when you put them on it?</td>
<td>I read some of the responses and there is a lot of good information and some that I would disagree with.  Many children are uncomfortable being placed on their bellies, but if there is nothing physically wrong with them, you can let them cry for a few minutes and struggle with it - that will help with strength.  I also agree with the use of the boppy pillow, and mirrors - children love to look at themselves, get one of those reflective toys so you don't have to worry about them hurting themselves with it.  Most physical therapists would disagree with the use of any of those chairs hat let them sit up, or walkers...that kind of thing.  I would also disagree with the blanket statement that 'it depends on the child'.  There are certain age ranges between which children should be performing certain tasks.  Pediatricians and therapists generally differ slightly on age ranges and ability levels (physicians generally using less stringent benchmarks), but they do agree that there are 'normal limits' and children who fail to reach those benchmarks should have intervention so that they can reach their full potential.  It is important to note that, contrary to popular belief, without intervention these things don't just 'balance out'.  

That being said, it is perfectly normal for a child not to walk until he/she is 15 months but it would concern me if the child were not verbal at that time.  I know your question was much more specific and I went way overboard with the answers but I'm very passionate about the subject of child development.  If there are any issues that you have that you want a quick reference on, go online and type 'Indiana First Steps' into your browser.  Click around in that site or the one for your state (early intervention), and you'll find appropriate milestones for age ranges from birth to three.</td>

<td>try rocking the child. make sure that you have a set schedule for the child. although the child cant speak they seem to understand schedules.warm baths help. johnson and johnson puts out a great product for bath time with a scent that helps babies fall asleep. also you didnt mention if your child was colicy, gripe water seems to work  for mild colic,so does ovol drops if it is more severe. it is an anti colic med especially for babies. talking or reading to babies even at 5 months helps because they like the sound of your voice. (singing a lulaby as well) you can try tapes with the simulated sound of a human heart beat, placing your child in a carrying seat and on the dryer for rocking method,  however you must remain right there with the child, its for safety reasons but you probably already know this. or take them for a drive. personally i think you are doing the very best thing right now for your baby. just try a warm bath and make sure the babies tummy is full and the babys diaper is clean, start a bedtime routine now. my 5th child didnt take well to breast feeding i switched her to formula after about 1 week, this may help as well even if you only switch to formula for bed time feedings it keeps them satisfied for longer. later it can be hell for you if you dont. good luck.</td>

Also, once she stops crying (and it could take her up to an hour or more) then you can reward her by picking her up. In due time, she will learn that not crying is a way to get picked up.</td>

<td>We flew quite a bit on long flights with small babies.  Keep you baby awake if possible for a few hours before you fly.  If he is fussy when you get on the plane, jiggle him, talk to him, but do not feed him.  Feed him right as you start to taxi out or go up.  That will help him not have trouble with his ears.  He will also then go to sleep.  Let him sleep as long as possible.  Have Tylenol available and use it.  You can get up and walk with him, and be sure to have teethers, cookies, whatever you do at home.  And relax, babies cry more when you are tense. 
 Tell the people around you when he is crying in the beginning that you plan to feed him to sleep right at take off and he will not cry the whole time, but just be patient while we load and get ready.  Most people will understand, and even the ones who don't were babies themselves once, too.</td>

It is an expensive project to get an idea from pen to market. A patent attorney is required to ensure that all the legalities are met. Those companies which claim to help inventors are out to make their money from your idea also and it will still cost you much to use their service.

If you truly believe you have a good , marketable product idea, (not just a variation on an existing one) build it and file the patent. If it is a great idea you could find investors to help fund the undertaking. Good luck !</td>

<td>The government act that pays the father to stay at home with their newborn babies?</td>
<td>It is NOT the Family Medical Leave Act....

The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) will let a father stay homw tih his newborn baby for up to 12 weeks, but it is unpaid. Trust me, i know, my husband and i just had a baby boy 4 months ago. 

The father can take up to 12 weeks off, but only if he has been working for at least 1 year ( or 1, 250 hours during the year.) Barring unforseen complications, he must advise 30 days in advance.

Fortunately, many private companies strive to create father-friendly workplaces. They recognize that giving workers time off to tend to the birth of a child or a serious illness in the family keeps employees productive and promotes loyalty. Some private companies even pay workers during the time they take off for paternity leave.



At Lotus Development, fathers receive four weeks of paid leave. First Union Corp. offers two weeks of paid leave, and Merrill Lynch &amp;Co. offers one week of paid leave within three months of the birth of a child.



And some states have adopted family leave regulations that are considerably more liberal than the federal Family and Medical Leave Act. Oregon's family leave policy, for example, covers businesses with 25 or more employees, covering nearly 190,000 more Oregonians than would be covered under the federal law. The District of Columbia's policy covers workers in businesses with 20 or more employees, and Vermont allows employees in a company with 10 or more workers to take a leave when they have or adopt a child.



The move for boosting paid family leave, however, took a blow in 2003 when the Bush Administration repealed a Department of Labor provision known as "Baby UI" that would have allowed states to use unemployment insurance funds to finance paid family leave. Some states, however, like California, have still found ways to offer paid family leave. California's paid family leave law went into effect in 2004 and allows male and female employees to receive up to 55% of their salary for six weeks while they care for a seriously ill relative, domestic partner or bond with a newborn or adopted child. It is financed by a .08 percent increase in state disability insurance contributions from employee paychecks.</td>

<td>help im a single daddy and mommy ran off what do i do?</td>
<td>Being a single parent is hard, especially for fathers. Mothers have a natural instinct built right into them when they have a child, but fathers dont have that same instinct.

Love your child. At 1 year of age, he is learing everything he needs to know from you. Be a good exapmle. 

If money is a problem, go to your local health department and see about getting on WIC for your son. This will provide you with food for him, and give him all the shots he needs for free. Even if money isnt a problem, im sure they would still help because you are a single father. 

Family services can help with Child Care costs as well. Tell them your situation. If you want, you can have the mother pay YOU child support. All you haev to do is give them her name, and they will do the rest for you.

Dont be afriad to ask for help. Rasing a child is hard, esepcially at the age your son is because they are exploring everything. But be a good role model. 

I would suggest buying some books on parenting. You can go to your local book store, and they have many books for singel fathers and father, in the Parenting section.

At one year of age, you son is old enough to be weaned off of formula, so you can introduce him to cow's milk if he already hasnt. 2% is usually the recommendation for his age. Make sure he gets plenty to eat during the day, snacks such as crakers, maybe some mac &amp; cheese for lunch. And 1 year olds love juice! But try not to give him more than 2 cups a day, because it can cause high blood sugar and bladder infections. Change his diaper about once every 3-4 hours, or as needed. He will probably be taking about 3 naps a day at his age. 

If you have any questions or need any help, just let me know.</td>

<td>You'd most likely have to go to family court, and sign papers that would give your mother legal custody of the child. I would strongly suggest counseling to help you deal with this. I can tell you first hand that it is a painful, but unselfish, choice.

It IS NOT "messed up" as the first person who answered wrote. I gave a child up for adoption at the age of 17, because I knew the child would have a much better life than what I could offer. Just because someone made a baby doesn't automatically make them capable of raising a child. This is how child abuse or homicide happens. Then everyone would be quick to say - - "Well, why didn't you do something to prevent this if you couldn't handle being a parent..."  

It sickens me how quickly people will judge someone for making the unselfish decision to place their child for adoption. Yet, it's "okay" in our society to abort an unwanted child! There's women out there who use abortion as a form of birth control! 

You are giving your child a chance at life, and nobody can fault you for that. I commend you for making the unselfish decision to give your baby a better life! Don't let ANYBODY bring you down for your decision.</td>

<td>Well, aside from distracting him with toys and bottles or whatever else while in the car seat, you really can't do anything about that. Your child has to go on the car seat no matter what. As far as strollers, you can stop using it if you want and use a baby carrier. Try Ergo (from myfavoritebabycarrier.com). It's a baby carrier that can hold up to 60 lbs and it's great. It distributes the weight between your shoulders, hips and back so no backache! It's pricy though ($92 but the website offers 90 day money back guarantee)).

My son always wants to be carried too, though he's ok with the stroller until he gets sleepy and then that's the end of the trip. But since I got my Ergo, I'm just fine and can stay out as long as I want. He even falls asleep on it. My son is now 12 months and 26 lbs and like I said, I don't feel backache at all. If you are considering the Ergo and have questions about it, email me and I'll help you out. :-)</td>

<td>For nursing moms: how do handle breastfeeding in public?</td>

It really helps to have a good nursing bra and easy access clothes. Find a comfy seat and position your stroller in front of you. If you look relaxed and comfortable people probably won't notice. Also, nursing while your baby is in a sling can be very discreet.

You might want to try practicing at home in front of a mirror or people you feel comfortable with (like your mom or husband). They will give you good feedback as to whether you are being discreet.

Bottom line though... you can breastfeed your baby in any place, at any time. In most states it is even illegal for someone to ask you to leave a place of business because you are breastfeeding.</td>

Also, you need to try to make sure you are not encouraging the baby to be up at night. Turn off, or dim as many lights in the house as you can at the time you want your child to go to sleep. The darker and quieter the house is at night, the easier it will be for your baby to figure out that it is time to sleep. You don't have to turn everything off, just turn down the volume. Babies tend to thrive on routine, so try to shut down your house at the same time every night.These things should help, but you should still expect to get up during the night for feedings.</td>

What I did was in the morning I gave her cereal(in a feeder bottle with fruit mixed in it) and in the afternoon I just gave her milk (the milk helps them gain weight) then at night I gave her more cereal (in the feeder bottle) and half a jar of any kind of yellow baby food and a half a bottle of milk if she wanted it which most of the time she did. Then at night she slept like an angel. It's not a problem my mom had five kids and did us all the same way and we turned out fine. Of course a nutritionalist or doctor will say that's not healthy because it will cause them to be overweight but the weight thing is hereditary...don't worry about it...your a mom do what you feel is right.</td>

<td>if 2 children born at the same time and from the same father(sperm) but different mothers call themselves twin</td>
<td>of course they share their fathers genes like twins. 
But they dont share their mothers genes like twins!

Otherwise I think in a matter of speaking they are like twins, they could say they are twins, if they feel like it. 
they should knwo that they are genetically only halfbrothers or halfsisters (same Daddy, diffrent mother = halfbrother).
But what they call themselves in public is up to them.

If they feel they are twins and feel more confident claiming that - they shoulöd just say it. There is no law (also no unwritten one) forbidding this.

<td>Can a baby get brain damage by falling down and hitting their head on the table while sitting will this affect</td>
<td>Hey. I know how scary this can be, but I have some experience with real brain injury. With injury to the back of head you have to be concerned with the brain stem. This controls breathing and other autonomic functions. If he never lost conciousness, immediately began to cry, did not throw up or get sleepy immediately afterward, he is probs just fine. When a person hits their head you want to check their eyes to make sure their pupils are the same size, as differnet sized pupils is a sure sign that something is happening in the brain. Movement, speech, memory, behavior, and cognitive function is all in the left and right frontal lobe of the brain, so I would not be concerned with any permanent damage. If you are worried, take him to the ER and see if they will cat scan to look for blood on the brain, but he is probs just fine and will be a perfect little hellraiser for the next 20 or so years. Best of luck.</td>

<td>It may just be a virus, or a reaction to something the baby (or mom if breast feeding) ate. It also could be something serious. If the baby can't hold anything down, you really should take the babe to a doctor. It could be nothing major, or it could require surgery (there is an illness some children get that blocks their intestines, and vomitting/being unable to keep anything down is one of the major symptoms - my brother had it) 
It also could be very dangerous if the baby gets dehydrated because of vomitting too much.</td>

<td>What happens to a Rh negative mother if the baby born to her is Rh positive?</td>
<td>an immunization given to Rh-negative mothers after delivery of an Rh-positive baby. This shot (RhoGam®) blocks the formation of high levels of the abnormal anti-Rh antibody and protects subsequent pregnancies with a high degree of efficiency. 

If a mother has Rh negative type blood (does not herself possess the Rh antigen on her blood cells), and carries a fetus whose blood type is Rh positive, cells from the baby can migrate across the placental barrier and stimulate the production of a maternal antibody that can cross back into the baby's system and trigger the destruction of the baby's red blood cells. This is termed a hemolytic anemia. 

The resultant flood of waste product from the breakdown of these red cells overwhelms the baby's ability to cleanse the bloodstream of this waste product (bilirubin).

<td>Why look at me funny when I breastfeed in public?</td>
<td>Until every store (including every individual one in the mall) provides a nursing room, complete with blankets, magazines, couches &amp; chairs, I don't want to hear any complaints! Have you ever tried walking to the nearest restroom in a mall with a screaming baby??? It takes forever. Keep in mind, in the past (even 30 years ago...) women did not leave the house if they had a newborn. The baby stayed home. Some older people are uncomfortable with public nursing. As for the young men and women who oppose, if you watch Titanic, I don't want to hear another word. It's okay to stare at a womans boobs in a movie, but not okay for her to slip while shoving her nipple in her baby's mouth??? (It seems like shoving sometimes...honestly, I want MEN To try it...yes it's perfect and beautiful...but it can HURT) Nursing is feeding. That's how a baby should eat. And FYI the only purpose of boobs is nursing. They were not made for men's pleasure, they were made to nurse babies. To compare nursing with sex or something of the sort is RIDICULOUS.</td>

<td>My daughter has reflux and they changed her milk to enfamil AR she is still spitting up what can I do?</td>
<td>Many babies have spitting up problems that don't require treatment. Referred to as "happy spitters," their symptoms usually disappear after six to eight months. For some infants, however, their symptoms are a sign of something more serious, and they need medical attention. Your doctor should be consulted in either case, especially if you have any concerns, and he/she will be able to you if it's normal spitting up, or a chronic problem that needs medical treatment. It is also important to consult your doctor before making an changes in feeding, positions, etc. 
Hold infants upright
Keep infants upright during feedings, and for at least 30 minutes after feedings. This will decrease the amount of gastric reflux. 

Laying infant down while awake
If you lay the infant down after feeding, place the baby on his/her stomach (prone position) on an incline of at least 30 degrees. 
This can reduce regurgitation. But only place the infant in this position if he/she is awake. Laying on the stomach is not recommended during sleep for infants from birth to 12 months because of the link between this position and sudden infant death syndrome. Based on guidelines set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics, positioning the infant on his/her back (supine position) during sleep is generally recommended. In infants with GERD, the risk of SIDS generally outweighs the potential benefits of prone sleeping. Prone positioning during sleep is only considered in unusual cases where the risk of death from complications of GER outweighs the potential increased risk of SIDS. It is very important to discuss this with the infant's doctor before undertaking any changes in sleeping positions. 
Nighttime
As noted above, position the infant on his/her back, and elevate the head of the bed 30 degrees. Gravity will help keep stomach contents where they belong. 

Smaller, more frequent feedings
Feedings every two to three hours when the infant is awake will reduce the occurrence of gastric reflux. Overfeeding can increase abdominal pressure, which can lead to gastric reflux. 

Thickened feeding.
This can reduce the amount an infant will regurgitate. Start with one teaspoon of rice cereal to each ounce of formula. If the baby is breast-feed, try pumping and then adding rice cereal to the breast milk. 

Diet modifications for mothers who breast-feed
Certain foods, such as caffeine, chocolate, and garlic, can promote reflux, so if you breast-feed your infant, you should consider cutting these foods out of your diet. 

Burping the infant.
Burping the infant several times during the feeding will help minimize gastric pressure, and the reflux it can cause. Waiting to burp the infant after he/she has a full stomach can increase the chances of regurgitation. 

Loose clothing.
Avoid tight elastic around the waist, and keep diapers loose. 

Avoid certain beverages
Don't give your infant caffeinated beverages, orange juice or other citrus juices. 

Positioning in infant seats and car seats
The way the infant is positioned in the car seat can cause regurgitation to increase. If the infant slouches over, it causes abdominal compression, increasing the risk of reflux. Using simple supports to keep the infant upright will prevent this. 

If none of these treatments work, there are a number of medications that often help. Keep in contact with your doctor as you make any of these lifestyle changes. Your doctor will advice you as to the next steps to take. 

I hope to have been some help to you. take care! Enjoy that beautiful baby!!!</td>

<td>What  baby food should be introduced at 6 months of age?</td>
<td>In the morning, you can give cereal or mashed vegetables without any salt. In the afternoon you can try making fresh fruit juices such as orange, grapes etc. which help to add to the vitamin content of the body. Make sure that you give the baby only fresh homemade juice and any leftover should be thrown. You can also try giving egg yolk, and water drained after cooking rice which is known as kanji. Fresh fruits also is good at this age. In the evening, before putting the baby to sleep make sure to feed him cereal again so that he will sleep well. Make sure to give him water after any food. Breastmilk is also very important for the development of the baby and has to be continued till the baby reaches 2 years or more. It cannot be supplemented with anything else.

<td>Can nursing cause a sick mother to recover slower than usual?</td>
<td>The biggest concern is that breastfeeding has high caloric and fluid demands. It takes about 500 extra calories a day to breastfeed. As long as she is able to keep foods down, she should be okay. Take care of the baby and the house while she recouperates, bringing the baby in to nurse when s/he needs to. She will not pass rotavirus through her breastmilk, in fact, she should keep breastfeeding in order to provide the antibodies to your baby so it doesn't also get sick.</td>

<td>If he is breast feeding, you may want to feed him ...then get yourself out of his mouth before he begins to get full.  ...Once he gets full, he's probably going to start biting at you in an attempt to make his gums feel better.  ...This is normal...my daughter did it to me; she, too, got her teeth very early.

You could also try putting a tiny amount of Baby Orajel or something onto his gums before he starts to breast feed, and that could make him less likely to bite.

One way to avoid getting your fingers bitten (while applying Baby Orajel, etc.) is to bend your finger tightly THEN use it to apply the Baby Orajel.   (Put the Baby Orajel on the bottom edge of your bent knuckle).  For some reason, it will hurt less if the baby bites a bent finger as opposed to the tip of a finger.

<td>is there really such things as night terrors?</td>
<td>Yes, there are such a thing as night terrors.  My daughter, who is now 8 1/2, had night terrors beginning when she was about 18 months.  As with your son, she would wake up screaming and crying, trying to fight away any form of comfort.  She never really ever woke up from them, we would just speak quietly to her and try to calm her enough to snuggle with her.  In the morning she would never remember having woken up and never remembered what made her scared.  She is beginning to outgrow them and goes months without them now.  For us, what works best is a quiet bedtime routine, lots of snuggles, reading books, no TV - she is still very sensitive to things she sees and hears and has more fears than any of her older sisters and brother had at this age.  She has a nightlight still, something we didn't use before the night terrors began.  The night terrors are really more scary to you than to him since you remember them and he doesn't.  I would mention this to your pediatrician when you take him in for his 18 month check-up and sooner if he has them every night.  Our daughter did have fewer night terrors when we switched her to another bedroom.  I know that is not a feasible answer for most families, but if possible, it may help.</td>

<td>When should babies start solid food?</td>
<td>Between 4-6 months.  The baby should be hold his head up without assistance and preferably sit up without assistance.  Baby should be able to move tongue from front of mouth to back of mouth (which you need to be able to do in order to swallow solids).  One sign is if baby has become interested in what you eat and starts reaching for it.  If baby is taking a certain amount of milk in a day (I've heard 32 oz) and still seems to be hungry they may be ready for solids.  My baby did not take anywhere near that in a day, but was very large for her age and her doctor okayed her starting solids at 4 months.  So, definately talk to your doctor because they can tell you if your baby is ready.  FYI, we started with single grain baby cereal (rice cereal is best to start) and the doctor's office told us to start veggies after she had been taking cereal well for a month.</td>

3-Take away a couple of the favorite toys two weeks ahead of time so that on the plane they will seem new.  Some parents even wrap these toys up.  Try to get the seat in the front because it has more room.  
4-We did not take a car seat, or buy a seat for our son.  It really was manageable, and that is a lot of money.
5-Change diapers BEFORE the plane ride.  Some planes have a pull down feature in the bathrooms, but back by those engines is very loud.  
6-I don't know any baby who would leave earplugs in.  However, we did take a baby blanket ( a little thicker one) so that I could wrap it around him and hold him to my chest so that he wasn't so distracted and could fall asleep.
7-You can walk him up and down the aisles!!  Have him walk if he has started that.  
8-If you take a small stroller that folds, they will take it from you as you actually get on the plane and put it down with the baggage.  Buy a cheap umbrella stroller for this in case it gets lost.  
9-Tag everything- including your baby.  Never let her out of your hands.  Don't leave the stroller unattended.  Going into airport bathrooms is tough- but Don't leave her outside of the stall in the stroller.
10-if you have a layover, or are waiting in the airport before the plane, have your daughter walk (if she can, or hold her arms while she takes steps) a lot to use up energy so that she doesn't feel so cramped on the plane.  

I hope that these tips help.  Don't worry about her crying for a little bit.  Planes are so noisy that the people three rows up probably can't even hear you.  If you can, get an outside seat so that you can get up and down with her easily.  Definitly bring an extra pacifier or two.  We even tied one onto the backpack that we carried our son around in.  Pack light.  Have fun!!  Take pictures on the plane.</td>

Don't put your baby at risk.  Try offering a little more food or some juice or water if he is going through too much formula.  Good luck!</td>

All of these help to relieve the gums but to actually help the teeth come through put a little lemon juice on the gums.  This dries them out a little and makes it easier for the teeth to break through.  After they have broken through use the teething gels (using them before hand does actually irritate the gums a little).</td>

<td>How do I wash my own cloth diapers at home safely, easily, and enviornmentally safely?</td>
<td>Washing diapers is really very easy.   
If you've been soaking your diapers, drain off excess solution into the toilet.  Empty diapers into washer and turn to the spin cycle to get out extra diaper solution.  Continue with washing instructions.

You may wish to run your diapers through a cold presoak cycle, depending on the efficiency of your machine. 
Wash only 2 dozen diapers at a time.  It's best to use a detergent with no phosphates and minimal additives and to use less detergent than listed on the box. Do not use natural soap products as they contain oils that will coat your diapers and make them less absorbent. On diaper covers, natural soap will cause your covers to leak. Problem soaps are All Free and Clear, Dr. Bronners Soap, Bio-Kleen liquid and powder, 7th Generation, Dreft and Ivory Snow. Detergents we do recommend are anything cheap (Sunlight, Era, Tide, Cheer, Sams Choice). Just be sure to use 1/2 of the recommended amount. Do not wash too many diapers at once or pilling will occur from the friction in the washer. 
Use a hot or warm wash and a cold rinse with the highest water level.  If rashes are a problem, you may wish to double rinse or fill a fabric softener ball with 1/4 cup (or less) of vinegar and drop in at the beginning of the wash cycle (it will open automatically for the rinse cycle) or add it to your automatic fabric softener dispenser.  You could also add vinegar manually right after the spin cycle.  Vinegar helps get rid of detergent/soap residue.  When washing diaper covers with diapers, it is best to skip the vinegar rinse. 
Do not use fabric softener or chlorine bleach ~ bleach causes premature breaking of the fibers and fabric softener adds a coating to the diapers that make them less absorbent. 
Dry on normal heat for about 60 minutes.  To make diapers dry faster, add a dry towel to the dryer.  Drying in the dryer helps sterilize the diapers, as does drying in direct sunlight. 
Diapers will not reach their full absorbency until washed and dried a few times.  This is because the cotton fibers need to be "fluffed up" a bit first.</td>

<td>When does a babies true eye color come in?</td>
<td>Depends on the eye color. **MOST** babies who are destined to have blue eyes will have blue eyes at birth and they'll darken (they'll never lighten) to their true color by between 6 months to 1 year. Babies who will have brown eyes **OFTEN** get theirs pretty quickly - most by 6 months (although my son's didn't change until he was 9 months, so go figure). Green eyes don't **USUALLY** come in until at least the age of 2 (but my daughter's pediatrician says she has green eyes, and she's only 9 months old!). So who knows?!?!?!?</td>

<td>how long do you have to wait until you can take out your new born baby?</td>
<td>A new baby can go out at any time after you get home from the hospital.  And, no, they are not so much more susceptible to diseases.  Breastfeeding helps them develop immunity to many diseases.  Of course, if someone is sick, ask them not to touch - most people will know that anyway.  Pick a comfortable place to go - over to a friends, etc.  I took mine out before a week and they were rarely if ever sick as babies.  It more depends on how YOU are feeling after the delivery.  And going out is good for you.  You can be dealing with all sorts of emotions and changes and just staying in your house all day can make it worse.
  It is true that baies get a bit more cold than adults since they have more skin per body mass than adults.  So wrap them in one more layer than you would yourself.  Not lots and lots, overheating is equally bad.  Just one more layer than how you are comfortable.  Go out and enjoy your new baby and your new life.</td>

<td>Should I buy a breast pump?</td>
<td>Yes i would advise having one. It is recommended that you strictly breast feed for the first few weeks without using another method but incase of complications it's nice to have. Also even though you are not planning to work for the first while, breastfeeding takes a lot of your energy because of how often feeding is required (every 2-3 hours for the first while) you may want to pump some milk that can be fed through bottle so someone can feed here and there and give you a little time to yourslef or even just to catch up on a little sleep. You should buy some breast milk storage bags so that you can freeze the milk. It last up to 6 months in the freezer and only 24 hours in the fridge. I can tell you from experience and from what i was told by a lactation consultant..... don't buy a gerber pump or one made by a baby food company. They will push air towards your breast which will slowly cause your milk to dry up. I bought a gerber pump and it didn't work but i could feel the air which she told me about. The best you can buy is avent for a manual and mandella for electric. A manual with take about 15 minutes per breast where as and electric can normally do both in 15 minutes. I do believe target sells both of the ones i have mentioned.</td>

It all has to do with your and your girlfriend's family history. If you were both big babies, you will probably have a big baby. If you were a smaller baby, yours will probably be smaller. 

IF you tell her to go out and eat to the point of obesity, she will have many health problems that will lead to a HIGH RISK pregnancy, such as diabetes, and your child will be greatly compromised. 

Just make sure she doesnt drink, smoke, do drugs, and Does follow good nutrition like eating a lot of protein, and you will have a heathly baby. 

It helps if your girlfriend is also older, like over 20 before she has babies because young women tend to have smaller babies too because they themselves are not fully mature enough to be pregnant.</td>

<td>Symptoms of a middle ear infection (otitis media) often start 2 to 7 days after a cold or other upper respiratory infection. Symptoms of an ear infection may include:

-Ear pain (mild to severe). Babies often pull or tug at their ears when they have an earache. When the fluid in the middle ear builds up, the eardrum may burst (rupture). Once it ruptures, the fluid drains, and the pain usually stops. The hole in the eardrum often heals by itself in a few weeks. 
-Fever. 
-Drainage from the ear that is thick and yellow. Blood in this fluid can mean the eardrum has ruptured. 
-Loss of appetite, vomiting, and grumpy behavior. 
-Trouble sleeping. 
-Possible loss of hearing. 

Symptoms of fluid buildup may include: 

-Popping, ringing, or a feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear. Children often have trouble describing this feeling. Children may rub their ears trying to relieve pressure. 
-Loss of hearing. Children with hearing loss may seem dreamy or inattentive, or they may appear grumpy or cranky.

Pay attention to any symptoms like these or otherwise that you notice--write them down and ask your doctor about all of them.  Colic can be caused by many different things and not all of them are treatable--some just have to be outgrown.  Fortunately, there was something we could do to take it away from our child.

<td>Do vaccinations cause more harm than good?</td>
<td>Now here's a question that's on the cutting edge of controversy.  The short answer is: not in most cases.  However, for those parents whose children *do* suffer intense and life-long injuries from vaccinations, the fact that the risk was low doesn't mean anything.

There is a world of research and information on vaccinations out there and the only way to make a sensible, informed choice is to educate yourself.  I know families who choose to avoid all vaccinations and families who only avoid some, it depends on the risks your children face in day to day living.

I've got a folder full of links on vaccinations here.  I'll share a few.  Just don't expect them all to agree with each other, it's a complex subject with billions of dollars at stake for the pharmeceutical companies.  I set up the first link to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program info.  Obviously some people are injured by vaccines or such a fund would not exist.  If the risk was low, the drug companies would deal with the claims themselves, instead there are enough claims that the Government needed to buffer them.  Think about it...</td>

Make sure that the formula is at room temperature before you give it to your baby.  Babies are more sensitive to instabilities of temperature, so cold formula could decrease your babies core temp.
Also, when you mix the formula, it can only be used for a short period (a few hours) before bacteria begins to grow, regardless of the source of water.</td>

<td>At 7 days old a newborn is still teaching your breasts just how to produce enough.  Allowing your child to suckle as much and as often as s/he wants is the tried and true way to naturally educate your body about your child's needs.  Allow your baby to fully and completely empty a single breast for each feeding, this ensures that s/he gets plenty of the filling "hindmilk" and not just the low-fat "foremilk".

<td>My baby has plagiocephaly?</td>
<td>In many cases, even a serious-looking flat area will round out on its own as a baby starts crawling and sitting up.  But to be safe, it's a good idea to insist on a referral to a pediatric neurosurgeon or craniofacial specialist as soon as you notice the flattening. A specialist should be able to tell whether your baby's situation is severe enough to warrant treatment and what your options are. Get the referral and make an appointment right away because you may still have to wait weeks or even months to see a specialist for a diagnosis, and the earlier you catch a severe case, the easier it will be to correct. If the doctor determines that your baby has plagiocephaly, he'll most likely recommend repositional therapy first — that is, ways you can reposition your child to avoid putting pressure on the flattened areas. This kind of therapy is most likely to be successful if you try it before your baby reaches 6 months of age; after that it's much harder to control the position your baby sleeps in. If repositional therapy doesn't correct the problem, your doctor may recommend cranial orthotic therapy, a band (or sometimes a helmet) custom molded to fit your child's skull. (Reconstructive surgery is no longer recommended except in the most severe cases or in the case of craniosynostosis.) If your baby has torticollis, she will have to have physical therapy as well to treat this condition. 
If your baby's case is not severe, your practitioner will probably tell you to try several things at home to help your baby's head round out. First, try to make sure your child spends plenty of time on her tummy (while supervised and awake) during the day to strengthen her neck muscles. You may start out trying this for only a minute or two at a time. Stronger neck muscles will allow her to move her head around more during sleep, so that it doesn't always rest in the same position. Your pediatrician may also recommend alternating your baby's sleeping position from back to side. You can keep her from rolling onto the side where the flattening is by placing a rolled-up towel or blanket behind her head or by placing crib toys on the opposite side of the flat area to entice your baby to look in that direction. You might also try putting her down to sleep in her crib with her head pointing in the opposite-from-usual direction. She'll want to look out into the room and will probably flip her head over to do so, giving the flat side of her head a break from the mattress. And be sure to alternate her position from one side to the other when bottle- or breastfeeding.
Finally, try to be aware of how much time your baby spends in a car seat, stroller, infant carrier, bouncy seat, or infant swing where she may be leaning back and putting pressure on her flat spot. Make sure you take her out of these devices for a good part of each day and hold her or play with her on her tummy instead.</td>

<td>my six month old baby likes to be in her walker all day, is it advisable?</td>
<td>My son also loves to be in his walker. But my doctor warned me that too much time in the walker isn;t a good idea:

Limit baby's time in a walker to no more than 30 minutes per session. Every baby needs to spend time on the floor, practicing skills that will eventually help her to crawl, such as lifting her belly off the ground while on all fours. She needs the opportunity to pull up on coffee tables and kitchen chairs in preparation for standing and, later, walking. She needs more chances to explore and handle safe objects in her environment that a walker of any kind allows; stationary walker (like infant seats and play yards) shoul not become baby-sitters.

As soon as your baby can get around some other way-crawling or cruising- doctors recommend that you put away the walker. Its purpose, remember, was to ease your baby's frusration at being immobile. Keeping her in the walker not only won't help her to walk sooner, but its constant use may cause 'walking confusion' (much as giving a baby a bottle before she's learned to suck at the breat can cause nipple confusion), because standing and moving in a walker (even a stationary one), and walking solo require different body movements.

It is not my right to lop off tissue that is not mine, that is not diseased. If he wants it done later, it is HIS CHOICE, and not mine to make.  I also did not get my daughter's ears pierced until she wanted it.

And it CAN be compared to female circumcision.  On the cleanliness issue- my little girl would be so much "cleaner" if we lopped off her labia to make it easier to clean.  If it was done in the Dr. office in a clean environment, why not? 

Intact penises are easily cleaned, with regular bathing.  Males have a greater risk of breast cancer than penile cancer with an intact penis. 

If the reason is to "look like Dad", less than 15% of males even know if their dad is circumcised.  About 1/2 of today's males in the US are NOT circ'd- it isn't going to be that big of a deal later.  

After doing research, realizing that it is no longer routinely recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, and that the US is the only country that routinely practices it, and learning more about all the nerves involved, I realized NO WAY. It's barbaric.</td>

Another thing is to drink enough liquids, milk, juices, but especially water,and avoid the alcoholic drinks because some can passed thru the milk to your baby and harm him; and you have to be care full about what medicines and supplements you are taking because some drugs can cause disminution of milk production. Try to nurse you baby in good position, and enjoy the moment, without hurry, and try to be relax, because the stress is another cause to decrease the amount of milk.I hope you can have a good answers from everybody!!!</td>

<td>what are the symptoms of a teething baby?</td>
<td>Common signs of teething include discomfort, restlessness, irritability, loss of appetite, and waking during the night. Chewing on toys and fingers is very common. Production of saliva may increase causing excessive drooling and coughing as the baby tries to clear his/her throat. Drooling may cause a rash on the baby's face, neck, and chest area. It is helpful to keep these areas dry by using bibs and changing wet clothes often. 

Local signs of teething may include sore, tender, swollen gum tissue near the area of tooth eruption. Sometimes, the gum tissue may appear blue or purple instead of the usual pink color. This condition is not a problem and usually resolves after the teeth erupt. Teething symptoms may be most pronounced when the first teeth erupt. Sometimes the wide back teeth (i.e. molars) cause the most discomfort. 

There are ways to relieve the discomfort of teething. Simple distractions, such as changing the scenery, rocking, or cuddling, may provide comfort. Teething rings, especially cold ones, can be extremely helpful. Once the teeth have erupted, avoid using the fluid-filled teething rings as the new teeth can puncture them. I used to recommend letting babies chew on frozen bananas or Popsicle’s; however, I have stopped recommending this form of relief because the pieces could become choking hazards. Try using a clean, frozen wash cloth instead. If drooling is excessive, be sure to give your daughter plenty of water and diluted juice to keep her well hydrated. Zilactin Baby medicated gel, Baby Orajel Teething Pain Medicine, or Baby Anbesol also soothe teething pain. Systemic analgesics such as baby Tylenol or baby Motrin may also be helpful. Consult your pediatrician prior to giving your baby systemic pain medication. Avoid using baby aspirin because this medication has been linked to a serious condition known as Reye's syndrome. 

Some conditions commonly associated with teething may require consultation with a pediatrician. Fever, diarrhea, and vomiting are almost always associated with some type of illness. If a fever lasts more than 48 hours or is above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, call your physician. If a baby is vomiting, has diarrhea, appears lethargic, or has serious sleep problems, contact your physician. Signs of gum infection include extreme redness or swelling, presence of pus, and heat in the affected area. These conditions should be examined by a physician or dentist. It is not unusual for infants to experience illnesses during the first year after birth. Distinguishing between illness and teething can sometimes be difficult</td>

Babys should be eating cereal with a spoon. They need to learn about the texture and at 6 months, it should be watery. You gradually thicken it as they get older.

<td>Hmm never had a baby, but I want to give some ideas :P
I think all of us learnt about liking or disliking from experiences. I don't know if your baby has a bad experience with water and thus he/she refused to take a bath subconsciously? The best way that I can think of will be starting from a very shallow water. (make sure it's not too hot, and not too cold) Since you are one of his/her closest ally, be there and comfort him/her. Get some of his/her favorite toys  (floating ducky for example) to make your baby's interested. If there are something he/she focusing on, he/she might forget about the water. Then do it constantly until you are able to get rid of the toys. If this does not work, another best thing that I can think of is "you step in the water first". A kid usually will follow what you have done because you have ensured that it's not a harmful thing to do. (I don't know about a baby but hey why not give it a try??) Good luck!</td>

<td>Baby's naturally go through cycles of "favorites". If your still nursing her this could be part of the reason, nothing is more comforting.  Also you didn't mention the babies age but around 7 to 8 months baby's start to go through seperation anxiety.  She has just figured out that you are seperate from her and this is kind of scary.  Since moms are usually the one they spend the most physical contact with when they are younger (nursing etc.) this is the person that they want there to comfort that fear.
As to what to do, explain to your husband that it's perfectly normal and she's not rejecting him.  Give him the space to comfort her.  If he picks her up when she's tired, leave the room.  It gives you a break and gives them a chance to work out a comforting routine that works for them.

Play detective and document when she does and doesn't have problems, and try to change things here and there to see if it fixes or makes the problem better.  When did it start? What was happening at that time? When does it not happen?
Does she get enough sleep? (My daughter had to have a nap everyday on schedule, or she would be awful.)

Try baby oragel if it is teething problems, or give her something to chew on like a pacifier or teething ring.
Since you brought up cow's milk, maybe she has a stomach ache, and doesn't know how to tell you. Maybe she is too hot or too cold.  Maybe her diaper is on too tight.

This obviously is a real stressful time for you, so be kind to yourself.  You and your husband can take turns giving each other time off.  Lower your standards - your house doesn't have to be perfectly clean right now, etc.  This will lower the stress level in the house, making a more comfortable environment for the child, and give you more patience to deal with the baby.</td>

<td>Do you get jealous of other parents having good babies and will it get better?</td>
<td>Oh boy can I relate !!! Yes it will get better....eventually. I have 2 boys and the first one did not sleep for a full night until he was about 8 or 9 months old at least and hardly slept (1 or 2 hours during the day) Don't want to frighten you here...! I frankly do not know to this day how he could manage because he was hardly sleeping during the day also. You are reviving memories. I was very envious on hearing other kids who slept the full night through ! My other son was better but I don't remember : probably too tired by that time myself !
We thought we were the only ones too at the time...
Do not feel guilty mind you. It has nothing to do on how you are raising your kid ! It is just part of his personality. You will probably have an active son later. Mine is very active now and loves sport and is always on the move. 
When he finally slept through the night, he was very curious and very active during the day too...not at all the type who will play by himself quietly.
Yes, he will sleep through the night. But do not feel guilty at night to just put him to bed. he will cry at first for 20 minutes, then 10 and then nothing. In less than a week both my sons went to sleep on their own. Problem was the first who woke up all the time. Nah..he is not traumatised at all ( I can see the other mothers coming..) and he is very social and I am pround of him.
Babies are like adults : they have their own personality.
I wrote a lot but upon reading your story, everything came back and all those days with no sleep : I feel for you.
Forget books, forget friends who have such "nice" babies. My kids go to school now but I hear occasionally a mother complaining about their own babies and thinking that they are doing something wrong.
Just hang on !
Your son will - maybe - become very inquisitive and curious. Think about the other side of the coin and be happy that he very probably will develop faster than the others later on.
That is my experience. All the best of luck and beginnings can be tough .......YES !!!

You will forget about it and memories will come back later when it will be your turn to read this kind of story ! (smile).</td>

<td>what are some at home remedies to get your baby to sleep more?</td>
<td>Just patience, patience, patience.  

Make sure your baby has the same routine, and takes naps or goes to bed at the same times as much as is possible.  If your baby is going longer between feedings, see if you can break the habit of night feeding by using other methods to soothe your baby back to sleep, like rocking or singing.  

I really don't think it's a good idea to put cereal in the baby's bottle, because their digestive systems and metabolism are still developing, and you could really end up giving your baby some problems (food allergies, obesity) by giving him or her things that aren't age appropriate.</td>

I would suggest you take you baby outdoors, I don't know how cold it is by you so that may not be possible, how about a drive that tends to put lots of infants to sleep. Also, if you are getting uptight and nervous, your child does pick up on that and may be responding to that.

Now that my little snacker is 23 and speaks four languages, and is totally laid back, cool, easy going and loveable. I see that the four or so months that i went through the feeding-her-every-hour phase went by too quickly. All too soon she was ready to start eating and catch up with her big brother. I say, savor this time with her. Guard it selfishly, even if you have to let other things go. All too soon she will be grown and telling you off in four or five languages! (joking).

Gotta hold on easy as I let you go 
Going to tell you how much I love you 
though you think you already know 
I remember I thought you looked like angel wrapped in pink so soft and warm 
you've had me wrapped around your finger since the day you were born 

Beautiful baby from the outside in 
chase your dreams but always know the road that will lead you home again 
go on, take on this old world but to me you know you'll always be my little girl 

when you were in trouble that crooked little smile could melt my heart of stone 
now look at you - I've turned around and you've almost grown 
sometimes when you're alseep I whisper I love you in the moonlight at your door 
as I walk away I hear you say "Daddy, love you more" 

Chorus 

Someday some boy will come and ask me for your hand 
but I wont' say yes to him unless I know he's the half that makes you whole 
he has a poet's soul and the heart of a man's man 
I know he'll say that he's in love but between you and me he won't be good enough

Have you considered that when your child is born and he or she is tested that these drugs will be positively found in their system regardless of what you try to do now?  The moment you found out you were pregnant you negligently put an unborn childs life in danger and your main concern should have been this child all along.  There is no excuse for what you have done and I can only pray for the safety and well being of this child that CPS does intervene so maybe this child can still have a chance.  If you didn't want comments you shouldn't have posted this on the web dear.  It's just too bad that you seem more concerned about your legal welfare than that of an innocent child!

<td>how can my baby sleep separate from parents?</td>
<td>My son slept in our bed until he was 12 months old - that's when I started the weaning process (at 12 months, I cut him off from snacking during the night).  He cried for a couple of nights, but soon slept peacefully.  I moved him to a toddler mattress which I placed right beside me on the floor.  I had it wedged between my bed and my dresser and put pillows all around so he couldn't "escape".  Now - at 15 months - he is completely weaned, sleeps in his toddler bed (but still in our bedroom).  At 18 months, I'll move him to his room.  

I took this approach with my 3-year-old daughter and it worked AMAZINGLY well!  Let the baby sleep with you a bit longer, though.  You're building up quality bonding time that you won't regret later on!</td>

<td>Start slowly and early.  When the baby is hungriest and most open to something new attempt a small bottle.  Learning the bottle after exclusively breast-feeding is a skill.  Gradually increase the amounts and the number of feedings.  

If these bottles are formula you may want to attempted the bottle introduction with breast milk and then gradually move to formula once the bottle feeding is established. 

Baby is use being with mom with feeding time comes so mom could try giving bottle.   This works for some babies ... other babies daddy or someone else has to give bottle and mom has to be out of sight, sound, and smelling range.

They do things based on emotional and intellectual moods.

Try to make or start educating Her with worthed subjects...
Like try to talk to Her (I know this might sound rather 'loony'), but you'll be surprised and amazed by Her reaction.
Talk to Her as if She's your friend from work or close friend....like 'Wow, I'm so tired, the paper work from the office just worned me out, but I have You, You're the best thing that ever happened to me'...Never do 'Baby Talk'....

It's natural and all babies go through it...just like they learn not to hit themselves in the face with a rattle.

EDIT: It has nothing to do with teething. She is learning to mouth and self-sooth...she loves to suck.

EDIT2: These people are wrong. Not every baby who suddenly starts discovering toys and fingers are teething. If your baby is crying and starts biting as well as sucking THEN she is teething. Babies mouth objects in order to learn about them...they have extremely sensitive mouths. You don't need to give her a pacifier - this will make her gag as well, she'll learn, don't worry.</td>

Babies' digestive systems are not meant to deal with all the saturated and hydrogenated fats (which will eventually cause clogged arteries) that are major components of fast food.  Plus, babies are growing and they need nutrients and vitamins that can only be found in fresh fruits and vegetables.  Fast food has very little nutritional value.  Breast milk is best for babies but if your friend cannot do this, then she should seriously consider feeding him fruits and vegetables; or, as a last resort, baby food.</td>

<td>has anyone done the mylanta trick to see if your baby has reflux?</td>
<td>CHange doctors! If you are conserned about reflux take your baby to the nearest childrens hospital, find a gi specialist. They will do an upper endocopy, some x-rays, some blood work, and a ph probe study.... My baby has severe reflux... his ped prescribed zantac and we tried it for 3 weeks, then we went on the the gi specialist beicasue zantac bites.... we are on a prescription formula, called ellecare, we wore an apnea monitor for months (there is a huge number of sids deaths associated with gerd), we are on several resp meds do to the aspiration of milk, we thicken his formula (use dr browns bottles with cereal nipples( we use rice ceraeal to thicken, we let him sleep in his carseat to let gravity do its thing *for a while he was the baby the dr said let him sleep on his belly, he was at more rish from gerd than the sids thing,,, he also had an apnea monitor to be sure he was ok, and last but not least, he is on an adult dose of prevacid...

please take your motherly instincts seriously, there is no such thing as a colicy baby..... there is a sick baby who needs help

and also.. my little guy is ony 14lbs and he is 7months old (just now doubled his birthweight(......

gerd is a serious problem that needs to be treated with the best of the best....after all that is your precious baby... that there is nothing in the world that compares to them</td>

<td>Does your baby do this?</td>
<td>My 3 year old daughter has always been a sweaty sleeper.  Her temperature doesn't seem to rise - she just gets sweaty - and her pillow and sheets get wet, too.  Just make sure your baby is sleeping in something breathable (no polyester or nylon combos) and keep him free of drafty areas (so he doesn't catch a chill).</td>

<td>I have large baby who is four months old, I am having problems with car seats, he's over 25 pound/cant sit up?</td>
<td>My baby was/still is large too. Now quite as large as yours though. My baby was born 9 lbs 14 oz and outgrew his infant car seat at 4 months so I moved him to a convertible car seat. I bought an Alpha Omega Elite by Cosco and it's been great (it can accomodate up to 40 lbs). Your baby is able to hold his head up now so it's ok to use convertible car seats, but you have to keep him rearfacing until he is a year old.  Is your infant car seat part of a travel system? If so, you can go ahead and let him use the stroller without the carseat. I did the same when my son turned 4 months. My family and in-laws went to Busch Gardens with my son in his carseat for the first time (he was unable to sit up yet on his own then either). 

Your stroller will save your back! If you're still unsure of putting your son in a stroller, invest in a baby carrier. Ergo baby carrier (from myfavoritebabycarrier.com) is the best I've found. I had Baby Bjorn for the first 3 months and it became useless. My baby was snug in it, and it hurt my back. Ergo is different, it distributes weight between your hips, back and shoulders. You can carry your baby in the front or the back (but I advise to wait a couple of more months before carrying your baby in hte back). Ergo holds a baby up to 60 lbs. My baby is now 26 lbs (he slowed down his weight gain after 9 lbs, woo hoo for my back!) and I still use my Ergo ...both on outings and around the house when my son is fussing to be carried.</td>

<td>How much does an average 8 month-old weight and what are the skills that they should have?</td>
<td>Now that he's 8 months old, your baby is probably sitting well without support. He may also be crawling or moving about by bottom shuffling — scooting around on his posterior using a hand behind him and a foot in front of him to propel himself. While holding on to furniture, he may pull himself up to a standing position. In fact, if you stand your baby next to the sofa, he may be able to hold himself up, hanging on for dear life. At this stage some parents put their children in baby walkers, but that's not a good idea. Walkers are unsafe. Your child can use a walker as a stepladder to reach things he couldn't normally get to, such as a hot stove or bottle of bleach. What's more, they discourage the kind of floor play that's best for your child's development.

Your baby may start looking for dropped objects and use his index finger to point at them. He can easily use his fingers to rake up a piece of food and hold it with his fist closed, and he's learned to open his hand and fingers to drop and throw objects. He's probably beginning to master the pincer grasp, too: the delicate maneuver that lets him pick up small objects with his thumb and first and second fingers.

Hope this helps!</td>

<td>when is a baby ready for infant cereal?</td>
<td>The latest guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics say that babies should be exclusively breastfed until at least 6 months of age.  That means no cereal or other solid foods until then.  The baby should also exhibit signs of readiness, does your baby:
Sit on his own?
No longer have the tongue-thrust reflex?
Reach for and grab small objects, such as toys?
And he should also show and interest in food too.

In two months, check to see if he is actually ready and then you can start him on whatever you like, except, of course, the standard allergy triggers.  Since you're breastfeeding you don't need to worry about him getting proper nutrition, it's all there in your milk.</td>

<td>Where do babies come from? storke?</td>
<td>I used to think when I was little that babies where bought at the hospital. I was very mad that my sister was "worth" more than I. I know that is not true now.
Anyway, females have an organ in their body called a Uterus. This is where a baby grows for nine months. It is like a bag of water and the baby is very well protected and hears all the noises going on around it; music, people talking and mostly the mothers heart beat. When it is time the baby passes out of another organ called the Vagina. It has to be pushed out. Babies usually cry when they take their first breathe, but they need to fill their lungs with a lot of air.  Everyone you see came out of their mothers Uterus.</td>

They grow out of it, but if your doctor thinks it is warranted, he/she will write a prescription for reglan or prevacid or another drug that could help.  You might have to use a special kind of pharmacy to get the right dose for an infant.

My little girl has reflux - she would spit up in the middle of the night and we were afraid that she would aspirate the spit up.  We tried about three prescriptions before giving up and accepting that she is a happy spitter - the prescriptions were ineffective and made her constipated and extremely unhappy.

<td>What diapers are the best? Only Dispoisable ones.?</td>
<td>Well, the Huggies did not work so good for me, at the end i was just paying for the brand, but the Pampers were great and also the baby wet towels from Pampers, the Pampers absorb a lot while the baby is still dry, it keeps the liquid really away from his butt so you wont see it never irritated and the wet towels are also the best, they are soft, they are big so they last more than others and they have an hypoalergenic lotion that  cleans and keep the baby fresh. I have tried Huggies and other brands with my baby since he was born, i went from the expensive ones to the cheapest one, all of them had problems like leaking or irritating, or the bands did not keep good attached to the pamper and sometimes in the night my baby woke up for a diaper change, but with Pampers i have no problem at all, and now my baby walks and it was the only diaper that remains in the same place i put it even after my baby jump and run. If i have another baby i will definitely choose Pampers, and they always have nice offers. Im agree that there is another brands which are cheaper and they absorb the same but the difference between them is that those cheapers absorb the same and the baby get irritated cause those pampers does not have lotions or the surface doesn't let the skin of the baby breath properly. And at the and it's no really expensive cause you use less diapers than with other brands.</td>

There are other rules of thumb in selecting a name such as:

* pick a name that reflects what you would like her to grow up to be;

* be prepared for nicknames - avoid names that will lead to the kid being teased;

* be careful of unisex names;

* consider the middle and last name - if you have a short name, pick a long first name and vice versa;

* be aware of tongue twisters.

That is with 3 meals, 2-3 bottles,and a cup of juice. developmentally They should also gain between 2-3 pounds monthly. but 9 months should be able to roll back to stomach, sit well,can get feet to mouth, stand with hands held, crawl with belly to ground, can reach for a specific toy,protests mothers seperation, shows stranger anxiety, smiles at mirror image. Hope this will help. again this is just a guideline and each child developes differntly with every individual aspect.

<td>Moms advice needed!?</td>
<td>My heart goes out to you both! 6 or 7 teeth all breaking through at the same time! WOW! I remember when my son was cutting his molars he used to pull at his ears and sometimes hit his head on the ground. It really shocked me to see him do that. He would also hit out at me. (I think they do this to Mums because they know that Mum loves them unconditionally). I was able to distract him by running a warm bath - and we both hopped in and had a play for a bit :) Not always practical I know but it helped make me feel better too. When kids get crabby - put them in water.
I know how hard it can be emotionally to have your beloved baby lash out at you when all you've ever done is been loving and nurturing - providing the best you can for them.
Hang in there Mum - this won't go on forever. You said he doesn't want to be without you and it is heartbreaking but this is really important:
Take some time out for yourself - Really please do it! You need to recharge your batteries so you can keep on being the great Mum/Wife/Person you are! Find a sitter/partner/relative to be with bub even if only for a half an hour and go and do something nice just for you. Lord knows you deserve it!
Behaviour could be early "terrible two's" on top of severe teething pain - no wonder he's irritable - poor pet. Poor Mum! You never feel quite as helpless as when you see your child in pain and distressed.
I'd be inclined to see a paediatrician if your gut instincts/concern about your son's teething and emotional behaviour and you are not getting the answers you want from your local GP. Keep asking questions untill you get answers. Mum - you are doing a wonderful job. This all will pass. Let's hope it passes quickly.</td>

First look inside his mouth and see if he has any sore's in there.  That may be a reason if it is hurting him for some reason.  

Now my oldest daughter used to do that.  What I did was I gave her a choice of atleast 4-5 things everytime I fed her.  Now the catch to that is every one of the choices was a different color.  At this point don't worry so much about only feeding breakfast food at breakfast and so forth.. Give your baby different things.  Try new fresh fruits, maybe those cereal bars that you can buy at the stores.  I would try higher fat content foods for now just til your baby starts eating again.  Also for now I would buy him some pediasure.  It is a high calorie drink that is jam packed with vitamins and minerals.   Also keep track of bowel movements.  A very constipated baby wont eat well.  They have these pediatric sized suppositories that help.  Don't insert it fully just stick it in a little to stimulate the bowels then take it out.  If that doesn't work I would take your baby to the doctor so see if there is a more serious problem going on.  Good luck!  And ignore all the ignorant comments that people are giving.

<td>At what age did you stop breast feeding your baby? How did you wien them?</td>
<td>I had 5 children I stopped nursing most of them at about a year old but I did nurse my third child almost 2 years. he was a special needs child. I wiened them by increasing bottles gradually and decreasing the breastfeeding. then when they seemed to be doing well with the bottle I discontinued the breast feedings. your child will likely fuss or cry some when they want the breast. but you have to be consistant and firm about not giving in. in just a few days of that and they usually adjust fairly well.</td>

<td>How to get our 11 month old to sleep through the night?</td>
<td>Thats how my son was too.  He still wouldn't go to sleep until 2 am until about a  month ago.  My doctor told me to let him cry it out.  It takes a week or so.  And i felt really bad doing it but it does work.  I put him to sleep and left and slept in another room and turned on a loud fan.  I set an alarm for 3 or 4 hours later and would go feed him and put him back to sleep.  and go back and set the alarm again.  Now im sleeping back in the room with him and he wakes up 1 or 2 times a night.  

I know it sounds cruel and i almost refused to do it but it does work.  There's a good book you should read.  You can email me if your interested at can't remember what its called at the moment.

Oh and keeping him up longer won't help that can actually make it worse if he gets overtired.  Put him to sleep when he starts yawning or getting crabby and rubbing his eyes.  Also do the same thing every time you put him to sleep it will help him realize that whatever you do before you put him down means its time to go to sleep now.  And try and get him on a flexable nap scedule during the day.

My son is 9 months and he takes about a 2 hour nap 2 or 3 hours after he gets up in the morning and then usually another hour or so later.  He did change this though he used to sleep 1 hour in the morning and 2 hours later.  just kinda pay attention to what your baby likes to do and then change it a little and try to keep him on track

feel free to email me good luck!</td>

For general diaper rashes I really liked using a salve with Comfrey in it.

Some rashes are caused by yeast.  In that case an OTC yeast infection cream like Monistat is effective.

Some rashes are due to food allergies.  For those, you need to eliminate the offending food or no remedy will work for long.

I added a link to a good page on diaper rashes, from a good site on babies.

<td>How long before a newborn's eyes focus?</td>
<td>Newborn eyes focus extremely well at short distances directly following birth.  Babies can clearly see the faces of those who hold them at about "breast-level" or 8-12" away.  Anything much closer or farther away is fuzzy at first, but nature designed babies to be able to see their mamas right away.  The antibiotic ointment that most hospitals suggest using in case you had an undiagnosed STD at the time of birth will cloud their vision a little for an hour or two, so let them get a good long look at you first!  (or opt out altogether if you're certain you're uninfected).


Vision improves gradually over time.  By about 2-3 weeks old they can usually track a slowly moving object.  It takes about 2-3 years before babies develop "normal" 20-20 vision.</td>

<td>How do you help cure a colicky baby?</td>
<td>This may not be medical, but this is what i did.  One of my two kids was colicky.  She cried constantly from everything she ate, because of gas---so when she was just a few weeks old I started putting a couple of drops of liquid acidophilous on a baby spoon and put it in her mouth.  That burst the gas bubbles and stopped her discomfort.  If we were away from home when the discomfort started I carried her facing forward over my arm to stop the "gas stretch" of her stomach until I could find some liquid acidophilous.  As she hung over my arm the pain was less and she stopped crying.  She is grown now, and still takes acidophilous.  By the way, the very best brand is American Health; it has to be refrigerated or it grows moldy and is no good.</td>

<td>What kind of textures has your child been having? If she is taking lumpy food, you can let her eat table food cut into little bits. If your baby is still on pretty smooth food, try to add more and more textures and see how she likes it. Some babies don't like texture at all.

My son turned 1 year two weeks ago and he has been eating table food for a couple of months now. He only has 4 teeth on the top and two on the bottom. He chews with his gums so he can eat pretty much anything, as long as it's small and tender.

Try getting gerber cubed carrots and green beens and see how your daughter likes it. If she likes it, you can buy carrots and green beens and cut them up the same size and steam them really long. If you can mash it up with your tongue, it's tender enough for her. Don't boil it. I've tried boiling veggies and they don't get tender enough. if you boil very long, the veggies will start falling apart and still not tender enough. Meats are also OK, but make sure they're pretty much shredded.</td>

<td>i have been breast feeding my baby for 4 months. now i gotta join work. what is the best weaning option?</td>
<td>Have you gotten your baby used to a bottle?  If you haven't, you need to start now to get your baby used to it. Express some of your milk out and have dad or another caretaker feed the baby.  Otherwise you'll have one miserable baby at daycare.

Secondly, you do NOT need to wean just to go back to work.  You can buy an electric pump (Medela Pump in Style is the best I've seen), and pump over your lunch hour, right after you get home, and ideally over another break or so at work too.  Then your baby can keep getting all those good antibodies from you (and hopefully stay healthy while exposed to those germy other kids at daycare).

If you can't pump while at work, you can still breastfeed, but supplement with formula while the baby is at daycare.  You won't want to do this cold turkey, or you will be HUGELY engorged and in some serious pain.  Start eliminating the daytime feedings one at a time until you're nursing first thing in the morning, right after dinner, and right before bed (and at night if your baby is a night waker).

I personally pumped, and then nursed all feedings on the weekend.  It's hard, but in my opinion it's worth it.</td>

<td>when is a baby too big for an infant seat in the car?</td>
<td>For an infant carrier as the car seat it is for infants from birth to about 27 inches who weigh no more then 20 pounds. If they are over 20 lbs and not a year then you put them in a convertible car seat that is still rear facing.  Even if they aren't 20 lbs and you notice that their legs are bent because their feet really touch the back of the seat (most likely they are taller then 27 in, or have long legs), it is probably a good idea to switch to the convertible (rear facing).  My pedi said when they get too tall it increases the risk of a broken leg during a crash. I would also think that when their head is level or above the back of the seat; that is another sign they are too big. I don't think that their head/neck is protected without the padding and support that is given when their head is lower.  Once they are 20lbs AND 1 yr, then the convertible car seat can be turned forward facing. And just for anyone that wants to know, you can use the convertible car seat from birth to 40 lbs (some can go to 65 lbs), you just have to keep it rear facing till they are 20 lbs and 1 yr old.  It's just so sad when you can't keep them in the infant carrier, it is SO convenient.</td>

Enlist all the help you can from spouse, family, friends. You are going to have not ONE, but TWO babies that need to be changed, need to be fed, want love and affection...AT THE SAME TIME! :-)) Get some help!

Don't give them cutsey matching names.

Don't dress them alike all the time. Sometimes is OK (if you just can't restrain yourself), but don't make it a freak show.

***Let them be together.***

My best advice:  ****Let them be together.****

Don't FORCE it, though - you'll be able to tell when they want to go their separate ways. LET THEM.

Sounds contradictory, but you will see what I mean.

They are very much alike, but the differences will amaze you. So will the similarities.  :-))

Once they are old enough to want to share food, or treats, let one divide the item in half, then let the other one choose which half they want first.

LOL Don't try to do it yourself. Let them split and pick. You'll be amazed at how carefully the right portions will be allotted! This advice (split and pick) works for ANY kids!

My Mom is the World Champion at fair division, however! :-)) Down to the ATOMIC level!  :-))

Encourage each to be an individual. If one wants to draw, and one wants to build with blocks - get out the blocks, and the crayons.

I feel sorry for everyone who does not have an identical twin! :-)) No one else will ever understand you the way WE do each other!  :-))

<td>Vitamin K and the Newborn?</td>
<td>Newborn infants routinely receive a vitamin K shot after birth in order to prevent (or slow) a rare problem of bleeding into the brain weeks after birth. Vitamin K promotes blood clotting. You have a choice whether or not you want it done.  Nursing raises the infant's vitamin K levels very gradually after birth so that no disregulation occurs that would encourage leukemia development. Additionally, the clotting system of the healthy newborn is well planned, and healthy breastfed infants do not suffer bleeding complications, even without any supplementation. While breastfed infants demonstrate lower blood levels of vitamin K than the "recommended" amount, they show no signs of vitamin K deficiency (leading one to wonder where the "recommended" level for infants came from). But with vitamin K injections at birth, harmful consequences of some rare disorders can be averted.

Infant formulas are supplemented with high levels of vitamin K, generally sufficient to prevent intracranial bleeding in the case of a liver disorder and in some other rare bleeding disorders. Although formula feeding is seen to increase overall childhood cancer rates by 80 percent, this is likely not related to the added vitamin K.</td>

<td>mush up the food...they need to learn to use their mouths to swallow still. 

don't add anything to the food. either use prepared baby food to teach her or get a food processor and throw a bananna or apple in it and feed that to her..when she learns to eat the mushed solids ...then offer "less mushed" until you are serving solid solids. also..try cherrios. only let her eat when she is seated and you are present!

also have a drink available to her in between bites..she will learn..none of us were still spoon fed in high school and every kid learns differently. 

don't teach them to like additives..they will learn it soon enough.</td>

<td>I have a month old son who has spits up very often, what can i do to help him?</td>
<td>hi, i know that it is pretty normal for babies to spit up, even after every feed.plz check if the spitting up happens withing half hour of feeding him or more. In case hes spitting up even long after he's been fed, consult the ped doc foe acid reflux. make sure to burp the kid properly after every feed. u may want to take breaks in between the feed to burp him. also ask the doc for other signs of lactose intolerance, in which case a soya based formula will help. check if his spit up comes with the burp, which is perfectly ok. my 2 month old son has been doing this since birth. when he is burped after the meal he spits up along with the burp. also there is this thing my doc told me for the kid, after every feed make sure u lie the kid with his head slightly raised and turned to his right, rather than completely face up on his back. this prevents any spit up from reaching the lungs. and plz do consult ur doc b4 giving ur kid any medicines</td>

<td>i need help. im wanting to start my 14month old son in modeling only im not familier with all this.?</td>
<td>Dont listen to negative comments !!! There is nothing wrong with wanting to pursue this for your child -Just dont become a scary stage mom - as long as you keep this idea as a hobby that could lead to opportunities, and an enjoying experience that you share with your child you'll be fine. If he gets good leads for jobs the potential of earning is astounding -make a commitment to use this money towards your child's future/dont be foolish and selfish with your child's earnings -it his he who is working and earning not you -only use earnings for his benefit and well being connected with the family. Make sure it stays fun the minute you start to obsessing about him succeeding you should stop and only if he wants to pursue it on his own later you let him - dont force him if he looses interest. Any way I am planning on trying this with my daughter as soon as she turns 4 mos. I am a former model myself ( mostly hair-shows) the best way to get exposure is to look in your phone book for talent and model agents -or check your classifieds or the internet for local casting calls for babies &amp; kids. Call up an agengy ask them if they are looking for new talent -the answer is always YES -ask them if you may submit a photo of your baby or if you can come in for a consultaion - NEVER pay a fee for anything - and some agencies may try to talk you into buying an expensive portfolio(photos) of your child from $500 to 1000 or more dont do it!! You dont need fancy pictures to get started. If you want nice pictures call around dont pay more than 100-200 but dont do it until your ready. Just take a bunch of shots of your baby yourself or get a friend who is good with cameras to do it - take head-shots, photos of your baby's different emotions ( frowning,crying ,diff smiles, -just variety - get creative with poses and have fun -keep them creative but natural the idea is to show how versatile your child can be. You may have to travel to larger cities to get more opportunies - enter contests for Cute babies -some offer modeling contracts as a prize -check baby magazines like "BabyTalk" they have a annual contest.
for practice on taking his pictures to submit go to www.ratemybabypics.com its mostly for fun you can load up all your baby pics and look at others and vote for your favorites those who win get a certificate -for "chubbiest cheeks" or best "baby &amp; daddy picture" "or baby of the day"
parents will leave comments and so can you. My user name is the same as here when you register you can put me down as your referal - _Hope I was of some help - remember it should be fun -if you want to try this keep it possitive -
almost forgot -Watch out for modeling websites that show off your portfolio for a large fee claiming to connect you to agencies - dont do it - -If he gets signed to an agency &amp; they have a site that included for free with their representation thats cool and could help generate leads or go-to's ( auditions &amp; castings)And one more thing when signing him to an agency (dont make the mistake I made) never sign exclusive to one agency -sign non-exclusive this will allow you to sign him to more than one agency which enables you to have more options -only sign exclusive if you are offered a mega-contract like say 10 thousand to start or better if you have doubts of what your signing get an attorney to read over the contact with you so that you are fully aware of what you are signing. Good Luck !!!</td>

<td>Preparation to set off a bug bomb?</td>
<td>It is very common to have a flea problem after getting rid of an indoor cat or dog. Remove the pet and the fleas have nothing more attractive to munch on than the humans in the house.

Infant systems are so fragile that I would not risk contaminating bedding with insecticide. 

For baby items use the bagging method instead of insecticide. Enclose baby items tighly in plastic and tape and remove it from the house during bombing. When bombing is complete, return the items to stay wrapped in the plastic for two to three weeks. The fleas that might have been hidden in the baby items will have their life cycles ended due to lack of food supply and water. You can still use the baby mattress under bedding at this age because the baby will not be able to get past the bedding to the plastic. However, do maintain a vigil on bedding everytime you lay the baby down to be certain.

Bug bombs are very strong. A neighbor of mine made the error of doing a bomb and didn't take a kitten out of the house. He really didn't believe that the bug bomb was strong enough to kill. The kitten died within 24 hours.</td>

You will notice this change while you're pregnant. Your breast will get bigger while you're pregnant, and get even bigger once you give birth when your milk comes in. So you'll have bigger boobies. After you're done breastfeeding, you may find that your boob will get smaller, perhaps back to your original size.

Try "The Baby Book" by Dr. and Mrs. Sears, or almost anything else on the newborn shelves at your local bookstore.

The first step to ensuring good newborn health is to breastfeed immediately and exclusively for the first 6 months of life.  That way the mother's immunities are transferred to the infant.  It's economical and promotes maternal health as well.

My first son started to teeth when he was 7 months. Our second son is 5 months old now, and has been teething since he was 4 months.

Look for the signs of teething. Just becasue you dont see any teeth, doesnt mean they arent teething.

Some signs of teething include:

-Chewing on hands/objects more
-Increase or decrease in appetite
-More frequent drooling
-Chin rash
-May have a elevated temperature ( however, anyting over 99.1 should be reported to your pediatrician.)
-More fussy, irritabel
-May suddendly wake up from naps or bedtime, when they usually dont

Some good ways to help with teething are:

-Cool or room temperature formula. (Most people think its better warm, the the coolness helps with the jaw soreness.)
-Something to chew on, that can be easily broken or torn and could cause a chocking hazard.
-Baby Orajel ( These types of medications usually arent recommended until the child is at least 6 months)

<td>Treatments
Although there is no cure for pityriasis rosea, in most cases the condition goes away by itself without any treatment. Ultraviolet light treatment or phototherapy may shorten the duration of the condition and may be prescribed for extensive and persistent cases of pityriasis. Corticosteroid creams may also be prescribed to relieve the itching.

Pityriasis rosea usually lasts between 6 to 12 weeks — the rashes disappear without scarring. In people with dark complexion, however, pale discolorations may last for several months afterwards.

Although pityriasis rosea may occur in more than one person in a household at a time, it is not thought to be highly contagious.</td>

<td>for how many months should an infant reside primarily with its mother in a split family situation?</td>
<td>Unfortunately, my child's dad and I broke up during my pregnancy.  In CA, mediation is required when you are going through custody/child support issues.  Our mediator told us that they do not recommend a child spending OVER NIGHT visits with the non-custodial parent until the child was about a year old.  A routine and giving your child a feeling of "being home" was important she said.  Of course this was back in 1995, so I am not sure if this has changed.  I will do some research and update my answer if I find anything on this.  Good luck....

I have found things here and there:  One circuit in Florida has developed visitation guidelines that take into consideration the needs of young children. It calls for short, frequent visits until age two, at which time one overnight visit would take place. Weekends would occur at age three, and week long visits in the summer after kindergarten. Many experts believe that this is best for securely attached children (those not accustomed to lengthy separations from a primary caretaker).  http://www.lalecheleague.org/Law/LawDivorce.html
My general position for normal children upto the age of three or so is that visita-tion should, ideally, be frequent but not necessarily extensive. Brief visits on a two to three times a week schedule are preferable to long weekend visits. Certainly, consistency of visitation is important to these young children and weekly contact, at a minimum, should be maintained.

As to the question of overnights, there is no exact proper time when these visitations should be introduced. Psychologists are, I believe, far more helpful in recommending how overnight visitation should proceed than predicting when it would be appropriate. 

As a general rule of thumb, normal children are ready for overnights away from their primary home and primary parent by the time they reach the age of three. There is, of course, fairly wide variation here, and some children do well with overnights earlier while others need to move more slowly. It helps to facilitate comfortable overnight visits if the following guidelines are followed.  http://www.pacehomepage.com/newsletter1.html
I guess the key is to research this specific to your state.  I just searched yahoo under "visitation and young children", then add your state.  Good luck!</td>

Formula fed babies need to be weaned from the bottle about that time because they are no longer getting the nutrients they need from the formula and prolonged bottle nursing can effect the formation of their teeth.  But many studies show that their are many benefits to nursing until two or three.  As long as your still comfortable nursing keep doing it.</td>

<td>Who has any good recommendations for diaper rash. My 6 month old has it and the ointments arent helping much?</td>
<td>K, my FAVORITE diaper rash treatment is called Bag Balm.  I LOVE IT!  It is an ointment like Vaseline, but it was actually made for cows teats, when they would crack or be chapped.  K, now I am blushing but it WORKS.  It is in the pet isle at Walmart, or at any feed store.  It comes in a green square tin.  But if it is a really fine bumpy rash it could be a yeast infection, boys and girls can get them. And if it is a yeast infection no amount of diaper rash cream will work.  You can use monistat cream, or get a Rx from a doc for Nystatin.  If it is a yeast infection don't use powder with cornstarch, my doc says it feeds the yeast and will just make it worse.  But if it is just a diaper rash, then you don't have to worry.  Oh, and with someone mentioning Desitin Creamy just a word of caution.  I have used it and if it is more of a raw burned bum be careful.  There is a fragrance in it and if the skin is irritated or "burned" it will sting.  I found out the hard way when my daughter started screaming her head off, and as soon as I washed her bottom she stopped.  Good luck and what ever you choose make sure their bum is DRY as a bone before you put anything on.  That too helps.</td>

<td>how to wean a baby from breast milk to formula?</td>
<td>OK.  First, introduce your child to the bottle with breast milk in it.  When the baby is used to the bottle, start mixing breast milk and formula.  At this ratio:

90% Breast Milk 10% Formula
70% Breast Milk 30% Formula
50% Breast Milk 50% Formula
30% Breast Milk 70% Formula
Etc. Etc.

Until all she/he drinks is formula.

It also takes some of the stength out of the straps. If you really want to remove it for washing, do the washing by hand with water only. Look for straps, elastic loops, or plastic clips. Some manufacturers also use plastic strips that they roll into the fabric, if you find these, simply slide a butter knife under it, and lift to pop them out (they pop right back in afterwards). Be prepared to remove the straps too.</td>

<td>Why does the water for my baby's bottles have to be boiled once - why can't i reboil it?</td>
<td>According to pediatricians, bottle warming/boiling is a matter of taste for baby only. There is no health reasons to warm or boil water or formula before feedinds, though some babies prefer it this way; especially if thats what they've become accustome to. In fact, you might want to consider starting your baby out on formula mixed with room temperature water or even a bottle right out of the fridge; if he or she gets used to it that way, you can save yourself the time and the hassle of warming/boiling water. 

Although boiling water for baby isnt a problem, and boiling water more than once wont hurt anything, it really isnt needed, and is an old wives tale.

You can always fold them up after the baby goes to bed to reclaim your living room for your own needs, and they are easily returned in the morning before you put him/her down on the floor again.</td>

Deione is said to have cohabited (!) with that randy god Apollo, and had a son by him.
And then there's 'Deione', a name worn by at least four different classical ladies, ranging from the speculated mother of the goddess Aphrodite to the name of one of the Hyades.

<td>Other side of the question. Congrats you made it farther than I did! I went back to work 16 hrs/wk after 6 weeks. My own fault, but I was not good about pumping for the short time I was at work. My son received bottles while I was gone and had received formula supplements from the beginning (he started out in the ICU and I could not breastfeed - pumped for 10 days).

Around three months of age, he began to refuse the breast - it didn't come fast or give him enough. I tried pumping more and giving breastmilk through a bottle. We both struggled horribly with nursing sessions for a couple weeks and I gave up. I decided it was more of an ordeal, frustration, and anxiety either of us needed.

Long story short, we were both much happier and it was much easier to feed him without worrying about when and where I could go because he was going to need to nurse. Or dreading the next nursing session that he would inevitabley refuse. To date (9 1/2 months old), he has had only minor "illnesses". A couple of rounds of stuffy nose and a yeast infection.

Basically, it's your choice. Six months was my goal, but it didn't work for us. I was a happier mom for letting go of those terrible sessions we endured in the end. All I needed was for someone to tell me it was okay to let go. The baby's doctor and WIC (Women, Infants, &amp; Children) agreed that I had made the best choice for our situation.

Good Luck and don't feel guilty whatever the choice!</td>

<td>What is the best way to express breast milk?</td>
<td>Why would I need to pump my breast milk?
The most common reason to pump is to collect your milk so your baby can have it when you're not around, and to maintain your milk supply for when you're together. This is essential if you're going back to work but want to continue nursing.

You may also use a breast pump to stimulate your milk production and increase your supply, to collect milk to feed a premature baby or one who can't latch on to your breast, or to relieve the pain and pressure of engorged breasts.

Finally, pumping allows you to keep your milk supply up if your practitioner advises you to stop nursing temporarily because you're taking medication that might be harmful to your baby, for example, or if you're hospitalized for a short time and can't breastfeed throughout the day.

Most women express their milk using an electric or manual pump. (Some women prefer to express their milk by hand, but most feel that using a pump is faster and easier.) Although it may feel strange at first to use a machine to get milk from your breasts, it usually doesn't take long for the process to become quick and easy. 

How do I use a breast pump?
To use an electric pump, you put a breast cup or shield over your breast, turn the machine on, and let it do the work of suctioning your milk into an attached container. Manual pumps also use a breast cup or shield, but you extract the milk by operating a squeeze mechanism or pulling a plunger with your hand rather than relying on a motor. It usually takes ten to 15 minutes to pump both breasts with a good electric pump and up to 45 minutes with a hand pump.

Good breast pumps mimic the sucking action of a baby and won't cause you pain. Be sure to use the right size plastic cups for your breasts and position them just right so you don't pinch or irritate yourself. Initially you'll feel quite a tug from a fully automatic pump. It shouldn't hurt, but it may feel a bit odd. Consider buying a pumping bra so you don't have to hold the cups on your breasts. (That way, your hands are free to hold a book or magazine, so you can read or work while you're pumping.) Remember to clean the pump parts carefully after each session to prevent bacteria from getting into them. 

What kind of pump should I use?
Choosing the breast pump that's right for you depends on how often you plan to use one and how much time you can devote to pumping. If you work full time and have to find time to pump during a busy workday, you'll want to use a fully automatic pump so you can pump both breasts at the same time. But if you only need to pump a few ounces occasionally so your partner can feed the baby while you're out for a short while, an inexpensive manual pump may do just fine. 

When would I express milk by hand and how do I do it?
If you only need to express milk every once in a while — say, to relieve engorgement or for a rare bottle-feeding — you may be able to get by with expressing by hand, although it might take a bit of practice to get it down. (Also, if you have sore, cracked nipples, you might want to express a little breast milk by hand after each nursing session to rub over them and soothe them.) Expressing milk by hand is time-consuming, though, so it isn't usually feasible if you need to express milk regularly.

Wash your hands before you start. Then, place your thumb and your fingers across from each other at the edge of the areola, and squeeze, pushing your fingers back against the chest wall, to express the milk. If your areolas are large, position your fingers so they're at least an inch behind the nipple. Use any wide-mouth container to collect the milk. 

How do I store breast milk?
It's best to put breast milk in plastic or glass feeding bottles with secure caps to seal in freshness. You can also use plastic bags made especially for storing milk or disposable baby bottle liners (although they may b</td>

<td>What is it like emotionally for a guy during the pregnancy and after within a year? My BF wants to know.?</td>
<td>Well, I can't talk about a year later, because it's been less than 2 months since my baby was born.  And I can't talk about what your boyfriend's experience will be like, because it's different for every woman and therefore different for every man.  But...

Until labor, the hardest part for me was the first trimester.  We hadn't gotten health insurance squared away, and the hormones made my wife crazy.  If you are anything like her, then your boyfriend will start to hate you, and he will begin to wonder whether he can stick it out the whole 9 months, let alone long enough to raise a child together.  Again, it's different for everyone, but in all probability, it _will_ get better.

The second trimester is probably the easiest.  You've gotten over the worst of the hormones, and you haven't really lost any mobility.  He should appreciate the time when you're not depending on him and not ripping his lungs out either.

The third trimester it will be harder for you to get around.  If he wants to go anywhere with you, he will have to drive.  If you need to go anywhere, someone will need to drive you, and it will probably be him.

Then comes labor, and that can be hell.  My wife and I had a nightmare experience.  I really can't speak to what it's likely to be like for you, because ours was so far off from the norm (20 hours, ending in cesarean, with severe meconium aspiration--my baby is still in the NICU, though we're expecting a full recovery eventually).  

But after your baby is born, it's worth all of it.  I mean, I still wonder what's next, and how hard it will be, and how I can make it through the part I'm going through right now, but the love I feel for my child makes it worth it all.

<td>how can i help my infant from spitting up so much?</td>
<td>All babies will spit up to some degree.  Things you can try to reduce this are: 1) burp the baby after every 1/2 to 1 oz 2) make sure the baby doesn't take the feed too fast - this overwhelms the stomach which is very small to begin with and sends the formula straight back into the esophagus, 3) try and thicken the formula by adding a small amount of rice cereal, 4) Keep the baby upright for at about 30 minutes after feeds.  Like I mentioned earlier all babies spit up to some degree or another.  As long as he/she is gaining weight and growing well it is fine.  If the baby has poor weight gain or is failing to thrive then he/she needs to be worked up for other possible etiologies (ie. pyloric stenosis).  Hope this helps.</td>

<td>how many ounces of solids can a 5 1/2 month old baby  be fed?</td>
<td>Don't feed solids till baby is 6 months old and then only rice cereal.  When you do introduce BABY foods start with vegatables first and then fruit because if they eat the fruit they won't want the vegtables.  Do not feed your baby soilds in a bottle.  I see so many parents put a jar of baby food or the rice cereal in with the milk in the bottle.  That is laziness on the parents part and it doesn't teach the baby how to eat with a spoon.  Solids are introduced as a way to teach the baby different textures and help baby to learn how to use it's tongue by using a spoon. That helps with speech development later.  Baby's will know when they are full and will stop eating or push food away so don't worry about "ounces".  What baby needs is the calories of the formula.</td>

Many toddlers are allergic to milk or don't like the taste... As pp suggested you can try yogurt or cheese for calcium, but I would talk to the Dr. first. Will your child drink anything out of a cup?

<td>This is a tough situation.  I think you need to have a good long hash out session where you discuss this with your MIL.  I know that doesn't sound like the funnest thing to do right now, but it sounds like it's needed.  If you want her to stop buying things for the baby, you're going to have to give her an alternative, because she obviously wants to be involved in its life.  Maybe just say that you'd rather she just spend more time with her instead of buying her stuff, or think of some other way that she can be more involved without having to buy stuff for the baby.  She seems to be competing with you for the baby's love, which is not cool, especially if it becomes a contest of who can buy her the best things.  I really think you just need to sit down and really talk through things, it may get ugly, but don't stop until you've come to a compromise.  You can't just let it keep going on like it is.</td>

<td>what is the chance of a pregnant woman with HIV passing it her newborn baby?</td>
<td>Women with HIV have decreased fertility rates compared to HIV negative women, however, to become pregnant, you must have unsafe sexual intercourse which puts your partner at risk for HIV. 


The risk of transmission from an HIV positive woman to her baby is approximately 25%.

This risk is higher for women with lower CD4 counts and higher viral loads. Most transmission occurs during the birthing process, although it may occur during the pregnancy or by breast feeding. It is, therefore, recommended that women with HIV not breast feed their babies.

<td>if your baby was born with a disability....?</td>
<td>My sister had a baby who was born 3 months prematurely, and had a lot of problems- physically.  We did not know mentally, how he was; whether he would walk, talk or be able to do anything on his own.  He was put on life support to help him breathe when he was 4 days old, and the doctors only found more and more wrong with him as the days went on.  By 18 days, he was fully dependant on life support.  My sister made the most difficult choice that she would ever have to face....removing him from life support.  knowing that his life would be surgery, after surgery to repair his deformities, and never being able to eat, or breathe on his own, wasn't something that she wanted for him.  31 days after he was born, Joshua died peacefully in his mothers arms, surrounded by all of our family and friends.  I know that she made a good choice for him.  I know that if Joshua wouldn't have depended on life support, she would have dedicated everything to take care of him.  A mothers love never deminishes when you have a child with special needs.  I truly belive you learn to love that child more, and you form a special bond with that child that you can't form with any other.  
I work in a school for children with special needs, and belive me, they teach me things about life every day.  It is very rewarding to work with these children, and I am greatful to have that opportunity.  hope this helps with your question.</td>

As far as the sticking to one food for a week or whatever, I don't do that.  Usually if your baby is going to have a problem with a food, he will show it within a day... so I just make sure that I only introduce one new food per day.

Then of course, there's the foods that you shouldn't feed a baby before they are 1 year old (milk, popcorn, hot dogs, etc...) - those I'd reccomend waiting until he's a year old to try those...</td>

<td>What is the best way to lose baby weight while nursing?</td>
<td>DON'T change things.  I was in the same situation as you, I had extra weight and I was nursing.  I started doing fast walking, slow jogging and watching what foods I ate.  My daughter went from birth 8 lbs 2 oz, 2 weeks 9 lbs 9 oz, 2 months 12 lbs 6 oz, 4 months 12 lbs.    It was horrible.  My husband and I were terrified as our tiny little girl underwent a TON of testing to see what was wrong, after 2 LONG weeks we found out she had suffered from dehydration and starvation.  The worst thing a mom could hear.  Keep telling yourself that you are providing life and nourishment for this little angel and focus on your weight later.

I understand wanting to remedy issues, but do it carefully,  My gameplan for our next little one is  water, water, water and infusing daily life with more activity.  Nothing extreme.  I plan to go out walking with the kids and my hubby, and putting on self tan lotion (being tan always makes me feel better!!!)

Honestly, just keep positive knowing that you are beautiful, strong (you just had a baby, boy are you strong!), and providing for your little one!!

<td>How soon should you add cereal to a baby's bottle?</td>

It poses a choking  hazard and it is a myth that it fills them up so they will sleep at night. They did that in the old days. Ask any goood doctor and they will say NO. Babys should be eating cereal with a spoon. They need to learn about the texture and at 6 months, it should be watery. You gradually thicken it as they get older. These are some signs your baby is ready for solids: She has good control of her head. She is able to sit upright in a highchair or infant chair. Her mouth opens wide when it is offered.</td>

<td>When do new born babies begin to see?</td>
<td>Your new baby can see best at a distance of only 8 to 14 inches, and focus when gazing up from the arms of Mom or Dad. Your newborn can see things further away, but it is harder to focus on distant objects. Still, the light shining in from a faraway window may catch your infant's eye.

After human faces, brightness and movement are the things a newborn likes to look at best. Even a crude line drawing of two eyes, a nose, and a mouth may keep your infant's attention if held close enough. Although your baby's sight is functioning, it still needs some fine tuning, especially when it comes to focusing far off. Your baby's eyes may even seem to cross or diverge (go "wall-eyed") briefly. This is normal, and your newborn's eye muscles will strengthen and mature during the next few months.

Your newborn is better equipped to see contrasting colors than closely related hues. Black-and-white pictures or toys will keep your baby's interest far longer than objects or pictures with lots of similar colors. It's a good idea to give your infant lots of interesting sights to look at, but don't overdo it. One item at a time is plenty. And don't forget to move your infant around a bit during the day to provide a needed change of scenery.</td>

<td>what is the best thing to try after trying baby rice when weaning and how long should you use the rice for?</td>
<td>I believe in Stage 1 veggies first, then fruits.  But any Stage 1 baby food will do.

Use the rice for at least a week.  I mixed my baby's with formula and/or breastmilk first, instead of just water.  They both knew the taste, and were more able to eat it.

You want to make sure your baby doesn't have an allergy to any new food you try.  A week to wait is the minimum.  I gave my second (and my last) only rice cereal for three weeks before I moved on to the next.  I wasn't in any rush.

If your baby won't eat the cereal (or any other baby food), you will want to keep up with trying to feed it to him/her until he/she will.  Don't push it, but offer it daily.  Rice cereal is the most nutricious food after formula or breastmilk, and it is the best baby food.

My youngest is now 10 months, and I still give her rice cereal on a daily basis.  Since she has gone through all the Stage 1 and 2 baby foods, sometimes I mix the cereal with a thinner baby food to make it thicker and easier to feed.</td>

<td>How does it feel to have a baby?</td>
<td>I would hardly call having a baby feeling like a bowel movement or a charley horse. For me, the pain was much stronger than that. I've had three children. What you have to remember is that even though it hurts, it's pain that a lot of women have gone through and they still come out smiling when they hold their baby. They would tell you it's worth it.

What helps is to take a Lamaze class and learn how to relax and breathe during labor. That makes the labor easier. Also, having an epidural will help with the pain. Some women choose not to do this. I think that having it helps you enjoy the birthing experience more. 

Another thing that can help is to continue to get exercise during your pregnancy. Most exercises that you were doing before you got pregnant can be continued thorough most of your pregnancy as long as you aren't having complications, especially walking, stretching and swimming. My sister-in-law was a runner and continued running throughout her pregnancy even though she was 40 when she had her first child. 

Eating right during pregnancy and not gaining too much weight will also help you have an easier delivery. So there are things you can do to make it easier, but don't go in expecting it to feel like you are constipated. Maybe yes, when labor starts, but before it's over it will get a lot more intense than that. If you aren't expecting that, you might start to panic more when the pain increases. If you know what to expect, it helps you remain calm.</td>

<td>Im having a baby boy, his last name is Macdonald. Which name do you like best, Mark, Evan, Crew, or Connor?</td>
<td>I think that it depends on the image you want your son to portray.  If you want man's man, a name that everyone knows and loves, choose Mark.  If you want a sophisticated buisness man with confidence, choose Evan.  If you want a name that is original and uncommon, choose Crew.  If you want a playful classic that is popular now, choose Connor.  

With your last name, I do think that Mark Macdonald is a bit too alliterate.  with two M's and two K sounds so close, it'd be a tough name to pull off.  Same with Connor. the double K and On sound so close is a little too childish sounding.  Crew and Evan both work fine with Macdonald though. 

Do beware, test the name with the planned middle name.  And watch out for Crew.  Some people might think of it as a phonetic spelling of Crue, as in Motley.  If you don't want this connection, don't choose Crew.

<td>How long does formula milk lasts at a room temperature of 32 to 34 degree celcius? Milk is from Bebelac step 1</td>
<td>Based on how much formula your baby needs, mix only what you think you'll use in the next 24 hours. Once you've mixed powdered or liquid concentrate formula, refrigerate it immediately (don't let it cool outside the refrigerator first) and use it within 24 hours.

Follow the storage directions on the can of liquid formula once you open it. Some companies recommend covering the can and using the remaining formula within 24 hours; others suggest using it within 48 hours.

If your baby doesn't finish a bottle of formula within one hour, toss out the remainder. Bacteria from his mouth can seep into the bottle, contaminate the formula, and make your baby sick if he drinks it later.

Tip: To prevent waste and save time, mix a large batch of formula in the morning and divide it into bottles of 3 or 4 ounces that you can refrigerate and use throughout the day.</td>

<td>What's the Best Car?</td>
<td>Because your daughter is seven months,she needs to be in a infant/ toddler seat. This is one that can face either forwards or backwards.  She can stay in this seat until she is three, usually, depending how big she is. She needs to ride rear facing until one year of age, at least, a little longer if she is small.  The reason for this is that the neck mucsles in a baby are not strong enough to stand a collision without damage.  Rear facing carseats would support the head in a crash better.

A good infant carseat will have a five point restraint system.  That means there will be straps over the shoulder, over the lap, and between the legs.  Evenflo is a very good brand.  i would recommend it highly.  It's safety standard is great, and it is a carseat that is comforatble and easy to use. 

 Read the instructions carefully on it.  The shoulder straps for rear facing need to be located just below your babies shoulders, but when you turn it around to forward facing, you need them just above.

I have done daycare for years, and have used most seats out there, and my top choice would be the Evenflo.  They make a few different ones, but they are all good.</td>

My husband and I let both of our children sleep with us as infants - around 12 months, I put a child on the crib mattress  on the floor at my side of the bed (I wedged it between my bed, my nightstand, and my dresser, so the baby wouldn't roll off).  At 15 months, I put a toddler bed at the foot of my bed.  At 18 months, baby goes in his/her own room.  Of course, we still get "visitors" at night on occasion, but I have no regrets of letting our kids sleep in the bed with us for that precious first year.</td>

She loves going on her belly but shows no interest in crawling what-so-ever. We think she will skip crawling and go straight to walking. She pulls herself up to standing all the time and last night for the first time ever she stood unaided for a good 20 seconds.
Apparently my mum said that I didn't crawl and was walking by my first birthday so looks like she's following in my footsteps.
I also know of mum's who have babies that have been crawling since 4 months old.
Every baby is special in it's own unique way. You should let them develop at thier own rate because as soon as he's crawling you'll be wishing he was still a baby you could put in the middle of the floor and wouldn't move around and cause havoc!!!</td>

<td>I'm sure you are NOT a bad parent!!!

It will be difficult to go that far with just you and baby.  Someone else suggested taking a friend along. Make sure they like babies!  

Plan on stopping a lot more often than you would with just yourself. Stops don't have to be long, but you will both be happier if you stop right away for diaper changes and feedings, before your baby becomes uncomfortable, rather than trying to hurry on a few miles more. Be sure to take things he is used to seeing like toys &amp; blankets to keep him happy when you get there as well as in the car. He's too young to understand what's going on, but keep talking to him in a calm voice anyway.  He loves to hear you! Try singing to him, too.

Make sure you take care of yourself, get enough sleep and eat healthy food before you go (and on the road).  That way you will be better able to cope.

Safe journey!</td>

<td>what is the earliest time to teach your child to walk?</td>
<td>You don't really "teach" a child to walk.  It is something that happens along their own developmental path.  Pay attention to what your child is doing, and follow his or her lead.  If the baby likes to pull up on furniture, make sure there are safe and clear areas for that.  If the baby enjoys holding your hands and walking or dancing, do that.  But you really can't push anything.  Some babies walk at 11 months, some at 15.  It's all normal.
  
DO NOT start using a walker.  When a baby is in a walker, he is usually not taking steps, but just thrusting forward with both feet.  The baby will learn the wrong leg movements by pushing in a walker, he will not gain any experience of supporting his own weight or keeping his balance independently.  From a walker he will be completely unable to practice moving between sitting and standing positions, which is one of the most important things the baby needs to learn. Using a walker will frustrate your baby and keep him or her from learning how to walk correctly.</td>

<td>What age does a baby start standing with support (furniture etc)??</td>
<td>It's different for every baby... I remember my son "cruising" around couches and laundry baskets at around six to seven months.  

They'll start doing it on their own, but be sure to provide plenty of opportunities.  Babies need time on the floor, on both their backs and bellies, from the beginning.  Don't put your baby in a walker.  They're not exercising the muscles that they need for standing or crawling if they're in a walker, and they're not in a position where they can practice any skills.  Make sure your baby gets plenty of floor time, and then, make sure that there is soft, low furniture around for baby to pull up on--stable, not rocking or swiveling, and no sharp corners (get pads to cover coffee table corners if need be).  Let him or her stand on your lap or holding your hands, too.  Give your baby all these opportunities, and soon you'll be trying to catch him!

Finger foods--just watch when your baby is ready.  When he is putting his hands into his food a lot, and reaching for things, and when he is able to swallow larger bites and maybe some small chunks, able to pick up small items and hold his head up and move it around.  Certainly not before six months.  He'll pretty much tell you what he wants.  Give him a cracker to try, and observe him carefully--be ready to fish it out of his mouth if you need to!

But remember, the most important thing is always to do what's right for your baby... if it happens earlier or later than "usual," remember that the "usual" is just an average taken of some babies who were early, some who were late.  Whatever is natural is just fine!</td>

<td>Will my unborn son be born with webbed toes if I was born with webbed toes.?</td>
<td>Webbed toes or syndactyly is the term used for when the skin between the toes or fingers does not disappear as it is supposed to during fetal development.  This usually happens very early in pregnancy - about 6 weeks.  The fingers and toes are normally webbed until 6 weeks of fetal development when the skin between the fingers and toes starts to disappear.  

Syndactyly can run in families.  It can be inherited as an autosomal dominant problem - that means that there is a single gene that codes for this abnormality in the family.  Anyone with the gene has a 50-50 chance of passing on the gene that causes syndactyly - thus any child born to a person with the gene that causes syndactyly - or webbing - has a 50-50 chance of inheriting the gene and having syndactyly.

This is a very common birth defect.  However, it can be associated with other problems.  You should look to see if you or your spouse have webbing or webbing in your families - since this birth defect runs in families and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion - that is, anyone with the gene has a 50-50 chance of passing it on. 

Also, some people have the gene for this birth defect and do not know it.  Other family members may have a very mild form of the birth defect  - just a little bit of webbing, so it may be helpful to ask your family about webbing between their toes or fingers.

Finally, if the baby has any other problems, you might want to consult with a geneticist or genetic counselor to discuss this problem in more detail. You can locate a geneticist or genetic counselor near you by going to the NSGC website (www.nsgc.org), click on your city, and genetics professionals will come up as those being the closest to you.  You can also ask your pediatrician for some assistance in finding the most appropriate and knowledgeable person in the field.</td>

There are alot of grey areas on this subject and most people just dont get it - -I am just female myself but I educated myself on this after someone gave me a pamplet on hermaphrodites at an art show that was conducted by herms. What I discovered was astonishing!!! It opened my eyes and my HEART !! There are many people born this way and dont even know it until later on in life- you can even have normal genitiala of one sex on the outside and have the genitialia or hormones of the opposites sex on the inside!!! If you think you may be one - call around for a doctor who specializes in this to find out if you are by running some tests. Personally if it were me I would not pick a side I would just be who I am -if you need to find a therapist who specializes inthis as well -you will need all the support you can get- the world just doesnt understand -thats not your problem thats theirs!! You would be amazed to find that back in ancinet times Hermaphrodites were believed to have been made as the closest to the image of God or the Creator because many religions believe that God is of both sexes and since he created us in his image -man and woman. So the result of being the closesest likeness to his image would be having BOTH sexes( the term is called intersexed) together. I beleive now that there are more than just two sexes of the human race - male , female and intersexed or both(hermaphrodites)and other (gay)or (transgender) The intersex alliance beleives there are indeed 5 natural genders!!!-!!! I think it is time society realized that hermaphrodites are natural and normal . It is so sad to me that most of the time when a baby is born this way the hosptial makes (or pressures)the parents  to choose a gender before they can leave when -what if the child was prodominately female and you decided it would be male -well that just screws everything up for that child -dont'cha think?? 
 Any way I'm sorry I got all preachy its just my heart goes out to those who are born intersexed only because society has never accepted it and why not?? Gays and transexuals are more execepted nowadays why not Hermaphrodites -why do they have to live in the shadows and feel ashamed?? - I think it is a wonderul thing to be intersexed and should be seen that way in society - I know a majority of people out there have at one time wondered what it would be like if they were a man or a woman - I thought as a child that it would be easier if I was a boy because I was the only girl. Wouldn't it be interesting to know what it is like to be  intersexed??? If you- my friend truely are -than I envy you a little- you should embrace it !!! After all as you may know the term hermaphrodite came from the Greek god Hermes and Greek goddess Aphrodite being merged into one god Hermaphroditus - so think about it - thats pretty amazing stuff!!!  Here are some sites for you to help you

<td>how do you get baby to sleep in the crib?</td>
<td>First off, it is not a mistake to let your baby sleep with you. There is nothing wrong with co-sleeping and more often than not it is necessary for the mother's sanity. If you have a 'high-need' baby (opposite of an easy baby), you will have a tough time making your baby sleep alone and 'crying it out' is actually a bad choice. Go to http://www.askdrsears.com/html/5/t050400.asp  to determine if your baby is high-need. "crying it out" will back fire if your baby is high-need.

ARe you worried that your baby will crawl and fall out of the bed? If so, try letting her sleep between you and your spouse. During naps, just let your baby sleep on the floor.</td>

<td>Babies go through hunger strikes.  It's a natural part of her development, and you've probably noticed that she is sleeping more, so she doesn't need as many calories.  

Keep track of how much she eats, and you'll feel better.  I've found that sometimes it just seems like my baby is eating less, but when I write it down and look at it at the end of the day, she got all she needed.

Try to feed her less food, more often.  Make sure she is having a wet diaper every three or four hours.  If she doesn't perk up in a few days, take her to the doctor and let him know.</td>

<td>How do i get my 5 month old to stop sleeping on my chest?</td>
<td>Perhaps your baby prefers to sleep on their stomach.  It's hard to recommend that because everyone is so afraid of SIDS (understadably), but I have a lot of friends (one whose father-in-law is a doctor) that found their babies slept better and longer on their stomachs.  Maybe your baby would also like a blanket to cuddle with.  My baby likes to have a blanket to hold onto.  I've heard of some women sleeping in a t-shirt for awhile and then giving it to baby to sleep with.  The baby smells the mother and relaxes.  You have to make a change, though, because neither one of you is going to get good sleep that way.  It will probably take alot of getting used to and be prepared for lots of protest from baby.  I had to train my baby to nap in her crib because she was used to napping in her swing.  She protested strongly at first--it took a couple of weeks, but now she naps well in her crib.  It's hard on babies to change things when they're used to it being a certain way, but they're babies and they will adapt with just the right amount of comforting from you.</td>

Hi again. Your situation really weighed heavy on my heart, so I called a coworker who worked for DCF for years and told her about your situation. She said for you not to hesitate about calling DCF for fear that it might give your cousin problems with the law. She says she handled many similar calls and what she did is go out to the home, talk with the parent, explain to the parent how to properly care for their children, and work with the parent to write up a plan for caring for the children. She said many times the people were good people who just needed to hear from an authority figure what needed to be done to care for their children.  She assured me that if the parent cooperates with the care plan, they are not reported to the law. Hope this helps.</td>

There is a boxed gerber food that comes with a side of veggies and a main entree. My son likes this and he likes to eat by himself now. Also, I give him applesauce with crumpled animal crackers sometimes for breakfast. He loves pancakes with applesauce too. When we're out to a restaurant, I order him chicken tenders. It's great for self feeding. Any steamed veggies are excellent and fruits are great for snacks and/or breakfast.</td>

<td>How do you change a babies poopy diaper?</td>
<td>firstly wash your hands thoroly 
1. Unfasten the tabs and fasten them back on themselves so they don't stick to your baby, but don't remove the dirty diaper yet.

2. Wipe away excess poop from his genital area with the corner of the diaper, taking care to cover the penis with a clean cloth if your baby is a boy, so he doesn't pee all over himself (and you) while you're changing him.

3. Grasp your baby by the ankles and lift his bottom off the changing table.

4. Fold the dirty diaper in half under your baby, unsoiled side up.

5. Use a baby wipe or wet cloth to clean your baby's front thoroughly. For a girl, be sure to wipe from front to back. This will help minimize the possibility that bacteria will get into her vagina and cause an infection.

6. Lift both of your baby's legs and clean his bottom with a wipe or wet cloth.

7. Swap a clean diaper for the dirty one. The clean diaper's top half (look for the tabs) should go under your baby's bottom, and the other half should come up between his legs (which should be spread as widely as is comfortable for your baby).

Try not to bunch the diaper between your baby's legs since it can cause chafing and discomfort. For newborns, avoid covering the umbilical cord (you can get special newborn diapers with notches cut out for the stump). For boys, be sure to tuck the penis down so his urine will flow down into the diaper instead of out the top.

8. Fasten the diaper at both sides with the tapes, making sure it's snug, but not so tight that it pinches his skin. Check the manufacturer's instructions for specific tips.

Retape the soiled diaper around the contents, put it in a plastic bag, and toss it in the trash. Dress your baby, and wash your hands thoroughly. That's it — you're done!</td>

<td>How painful is natural childbirth?</td>
<td>It totally depends on the person, the amount of support she gets durning, how focused/metatative mom can get durning, the size of the baby and even the baby's position. Some women have very little or no pain, while others have pain so bad they swear off having another child.

I was in less pain if I could get up and move around. With my first I got stuck on the bed and having to sit there was aweful. I'm not one that can meditate by myself and with my first I was stuck on the labor bed and not allowed to get up. I ended up getting an epidural because my labor was progressing slowly and every contraction hurt. With my third I was able to drastically reduce the labor pains by bouncing on a labor ball (kinda like an excerise ball).

if you can afford it, get the doula or a real midwife. Both will sit right there with you through the entire labor helping you reduce the pain, giving you ideas on what might work, talking to the nurses (those commando nurses are horrible, but it seems every hospital has one). I can not recommend having one with you enough.</td>

<td>Losing weight while breast feeding?</td>
<td>The only SAFE and EFFICIENT way to lose weight is a good diet and regular exercise!  It will also help if you were in good shape before you got pregnant and continued a sensible exercise routine while you were pregnant.  I was in belly dancing for 2 years before I got pregnant and was a regular at my local gym.  I only gained 37lbs. when I got pregnant(gave birth late nov. 1st child).  I weighed about 157 pre pregnancy, and now I'm at 166.  I did belly dancing up until I was about 4 months pregnant, and stuck with mild walking after that.  Once labor started, I pushed for 20 minutes and he was born!  After I had him, I enrolled back into my bellydancing classes(when he was about 3 1/2 months old) and I started walking again.  This has really helped me lose my pregnancy weight.  I still have about 10 vanity pounds left, but overall my body shape has gone somewhat back to normal.  I exclusively breastfed my baby for 5 months.  I dont produce much milk anymore, which was by my choice, not my bodys.  I went back to work and slowly stopped producing.
Anyways... 
I HIGHLY recommend getting into bellydancing because it targets the area that needs toning before and after having a baby.  Its also tons of fun!!
On a side note:  I read that belly dancing was intended to prepare a womens body for childbirth.


Just remember...you cant burn fat unless you do cardio!!
Also, to lose weight quicker, your outtake must be higher than your intake.  Ex:  If you were to eat 2000 calories in one day, burn 2300 calories when exercising.
Look it up on the internet and see what you can find.  
Good luck and be patient, everyones body is different!</td>

<td>where did the word doula originate?</td>
<td>The word doula comes from Greek, and refers to a woman who personally serves another woman. In Greece, the word has some negative connotations, denoting "slave" or "servant of God," as some doulas have inadvertently discovered through their international social networks. Anthropologist Dana Raphael first used this term to refer to experienced mothers who assisted new mothers in breastfeeding and newborn care in the Philippines. Thus the term arose initially with reference to the postpartum context, and is still used in that domain. Medical researchers Marshall Klaus and John Kennell, who conducted the first of several randomized clinical trials on the medical outcomes of doula attended births, adopted the term "doula" to refer to labor support as well as prenatal and postpartum support.</td>

Now, as for the bleeding...I was on Depo a while back (before my doctor warned me of the consequences), and had the same reaction.  I hadn't been pregnant recently or anything, but as the Depo began to wear off, I had excessive bleeding and flu-like symptoms for well over a week straight.  It surprised me, as I had used Depo in the past without problems.  When I asked the doctor about it, I was told never to go on it again.  The patch was my next option, and I truly loved it!

Things you may wish to discuss with them....colic, the consistency of the cereal, bottles made for this  transition between liquids to semi solids(special nipple to allow runny rice cereal through).  Are you allowing time between each bite   to have a drink from a water bottle?  Also with my daughter I found that stopping every 2-3 bites to "burp" helped a lot.  Per  the recommendation of Gramma I always used the following method to assist in burping... start low on the baby's back and always in an upward motion vary the pattern of light, rhythmic taps ending each time in the center top portion of the back just below where the back of the neck begins.  There is almost always a burp there waiting to come out so be patient as you repeat the light, rhythmic tapping from bottom to top then lift hand to start again at the bottom progressing always to the top.

Other than that, try to eat mostly healthy and relatively low-calorie foods and limit the more fattening things in frequency and serving size.  A square of chocolate can be very satisfying.

In addition, exercise will help.  Just walking for 20-30 minutes several time a week or daily (you can carry your baby in a soft carrier) will get you burning calories.</td>

It's called Fenugreek and it can be found at almost any health food store. Drinking a lot of water is key too and to avoid caffeine, it will dry up your milk.

<td>You have a big baby, just like my son. My son was also about 16 lbs when he was 3 months old. He outgrew a lot of things really really fast.

Most swings have a 20 lbs limit, but not all...MOST. If your daughter is getting uncomfortable or if she is making the swing move when she wiggles,  I would stop putting her in it.  You can use a baby bouncer, (not walker) if she can hold her head up pretty well. I have a hand me down bouncer that I started using when my son was about 6 months old and I can still occasionally put him there now that he is 13 months old. I don't use it all the time, just when I need to go to bathroom and I can't keep an eye on him.   A play pen is a very good thing to get too. Your baby will not outgrow that as fast.

I also suggest getting a baby carrier. Your baby will get too heavy for you (if not already) pretty fast. My son reached 25 lbs when he was 9 months old. As you can imagine, that's pretty heavy to be carried. I got a Ergo baby carrier from http://www.myfavoritebabycarrier.com  It's pricy but worth it considering you'll be carrying your baby for a long while still. It'll save your back.</td>

At 8 months, she should only be practicing solids and should be getting most of her nutrition from milk.

<td>One of my friend has milk in her breast and she never pragnant, is this a problem for her. and some time she?</td>
<td>That is not right for her life, and you know it. 

Say to her that you have a problem with the pill, why not both go to the doctor? That you won't go on your own and you are worried? Because you are scared. Then just tell the doctor that your friend needed support, and you didn't know what to tell her. 

You are a very good friend to listen to her. Go together, and let the doctor ask any more questions that need to be asked. 

The doctor will have heard this all before, from other women. It is only between her and the doctor. No one else needs to know. If you both go, she will think you both have a secret, and it will not be as scary for her.   

When I was 17, my friend wanted to go on the pill, and said she would not ask a doctor. I said I'd go with her and we both would get it, and we both did, all was OK. I just didn't take mine, because I didn't have a lover until I was 22. But she was fine, and needed to. 

Good luck, and I hope your friend is fine.</td>

<td>why is dec.25 choosen as chrimas day?</td>
<td>When Christianity was spreading, it incorperated Pagan holidays into its calender by changing them into Christian celebrations.  For example, a pagan rite of spring was changed into Easter, and another midwinter celebration was adopted as the celebrated birth of Christ.  However, no one actually knows at what point in the year Christ was born, and it's a symbolical celebration of the event, not his actual "birthday."</td>

<td>what is the differece in ingredients between human milk , formula and cow milk?</td>
<td>Human milk is best for human babies because, like all mammals, human produce a milk specifically designed for the human infant (and cows for baby calves, and sheep for baby lambs, etc).  Some components of human milk that are absent from cow's milk include Lactose (aids in Calcium absorption), Bile Salt Stimulated Lipase (aids in digestion of fats), Cystine, Taurine, Secretory Immunoglobulin A (sIgA), Lactoferrin (binds Iron and makes it unavailable to bacteria in the intestines), Lysozyme (breaks cell walls of bacteria in the GI tract), Bifidus Factor (creates more acidic stool, inhibits growth of harmful bacteria), Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids, Essential Fatty Acids (Linoleic, Linolenic, Arachadonic), and Whey protein.  

Cow's milk has much larger proteins than human milk (remember, cows have 4 stomach), which is why it is usually not given to human babies until they are 1 year old and their digestive systems mature.  

Formula is a scientific attempt to mimic human milk, using a cow's milk base.  Formula companies are constantly reformulating their forumla as new compounds are found in human milk.

A breastfeeding mother's diet is more likely to affect her than the baby . . . the body tends to provide nutrients to the baby before the mother, so a diet with less than adequate vitamens usually affects mom.  Sometimes certain foods tend to bother the baby  when mom eats them.  

A vegan mother need not use formula . . . she must be careful to maintain adequate b12, calcium, and zinc in her diet, but all vegans must do this, breastfeeding or not.

As to why drinking cow's milk is unnecessary . . . mammals are not designed to drink milk past the age of weaning.  Nor are they designed to drink the milk of other mammals.  Calcium is important when breastfeeding, but there are many non-dairy sources of calcium.  

Women can breastfeed babies while eating diets of only rice or other grains, with sparse vegetables and meat.  Obviously a better diet for mom means a better diet for baby, but even very meager diets (and even very sugary diets) provide the basic building blocks for good breastmilk.  

Hope this stirs intrest in you for breastfeeding some day in the future.</td>

<td>How long should you brest feed for ?</td>
<td>Until the first permanent molars come in or the child decides to stop.  That is conviently about the same time that the immune system is fully developed.

After about 18 months the child can no longer get all nutrients from breastmilk and solids should be encouraged if the child has not yet started them (I've never heard of this happening, although I have read of babies that didn't really start solids until 15 months).  Breastmilk continues to provide immunological benefits and healthy amounts of high-quality fat for brain development throughout the nursing relationship.</td>

<td>When is it appropriate to stop boiling water for a baby's bottle?</td>
<td>Good for you!  You actually read the entire formula can!  Not many people do that anymore!  The point in boiling water for the formula is so that you have sterile water--clean, safe water to mix the formula with.  If your water supply is clean and safe, you don't need to boil it, though with some brands of formula hot water mixes the formula faster and more completely.  
As for when you can start taking away the formula and giving milk to your baby--talk to your daughters doctor or WIC person.  If your daughter has no health problems that milk would cause or make worse, you should be able to switch to whole milk at any time.  Do not give a child under age 5 skim milk unless your doctor tells you to.  Children under 5 need the fat in whole milk to continue to develop at a healthy rate.  Only give 2% milk after your doctor or WIC person says that it's time to change.  After age 5, unless there are other health problems, no one really needs whole milk--it just adds pounds to you!  Children of any age shouldn't have milk skimmer than 2%, unless a health professional says that the child needs to have something else.</td>

<td>How do I make my seven month old like, or at least tolerate, tummytime?</td>
<td>You have to do a little at a time at first, and gradually work up from there.  Do short periods of time frequently.  A lot of babies hate tummy time nowadays, because they spend so much more time on their backs.  It is important to make sure babies sleep on their backs, of course.

Start doing it just a few minutes at a time.  Get down on the floor with the baby.  Keep toys where he or she can see them (and you).  By doing it frequently, and for very short periods, the baby will learn that he (or she) is not going to be "stuck" there, and eventually will tolerate longer periods.

Tummy time is definitely important, as this is how babies develop what are called their "ventral" motor skills, such as pushing up, crawling, and eventually pulling up onto furniture.  Keep at it!</td>

If your baby is allergic or intolerant of milk, then you'll have to try soy based BABY Formla. But always go for the milk based formula first.

When he starts drinking juices, don't give him ones that have a lot of acid in them, like orange juice.  Make sure that you don't lay him down flat for at least 20 minutes after he eats and keep the head of his bed elevated with a wedge or a pillow under the mattress on one side.

<td>How do I get my 8 month old son to take naps?</td>
<td>My daughter is 8 months and a week old; this is what we did and what i would recommend to anyone...
At Night
1) we put her to sleep at around 8-8:30 pm
2) She wakes up around 7-8 am
In the morning
1) We don't let her sleep till 3 hours after she wakes up and let him sleep till 1pm ( note : make sure he DOES NOT sleep after 1, as you must wake him up at that time )
2) we keep her awake till 5 pm and let her take about 1 hour.

The whole point is that the baby doesn't sleep  more than 3 hours during the day.

Now as to him not sleeping on the bed....here's a few tricks

1) keep him awake until he start crying for sleep ( not too hard just till he starts whining ) then rock him in your arms and very gently put him on the bed
2) Make sure that he feeds well; and I'm not talking about breast or bottle feeding but actual food the baby must have at least 2 - 3 meals a day once when he wakes up, once mid-day and once in the afternoon.
3) make sure that the baby doesn't have an upset, by giving im gripe water - it's natural and doesn't harm the baby give him 2.5 ml of gripe water every once or twice a day that would stop any stomach aches.
4) don't let him cry too long - maybe that's why he won't sleep on his own as it imprints in his mind that you will leave him always stay close and pat him to reassure him and he will sleep.

If all the above fail, I believe you'd need to see a mid-wife or senior nurse to give you more professional advice.</td>

The Medicine they give you depends on if you have a c-section or a regular delivery. You can have an epidural, it numbs you from the waist down, you can't feel anything or move your legs, or you can have a spinal. That also numbs you and you can't feel anything. I liked the spinal better, the epidural messed up my back..

If you have a natural delivery you can usually go home the next day as long as everything went ok and you and the baby are fine. C-section you will have to stay 2-3 days, as long as everything goes good..</td>

That means, dont start something that you wouldnt want to be doing 6 months from now, or a year from now.
From the time your baby is born, it is your responsibility to teach it to become independant of you.  However, right now it NEEDS you to live.  So, it is a very fine line you have to walk.  
A newborn needs to be near you all the time.  Dont hold him so he falls asleep.  This is a bad habbit that you dont want to be doing 6 months down the road.  Dont let him cry to sleep, under the age of 3 months, babies are incapeable of calming themselvs down and putting themselves tosleep after being worked up.  you need to teach him how to do it, sleeping in not a natural instinct.  
Whenever possible lay the baby down and just rub his back, or touch him so that he knows you are there, but not neccessarly holding him.  you want to teach him that he is ok even if not in your arms.  this is how you need to teach him to sleep too.  wrap him like a burrito, lay him on his back or side and pat his back or leg gently and shush him to sleep in a dark room.  DO THIS EVERY TIME YOU PUT HIM TO BED.  Eventually he will learn to do it on his own.  And batta bing, you just TAUGHT your baby to sooth himself.  To me, a baby should be able to put himself alseep on his own.  This is the #1 neccesity everyone should know how to do.  I cant stress this more.</td>

<td>my grandson just turned 4 months old and we have been giving him baby food and rice cereal for like 2 months now. he acted like he wasn't getting enough too. he could eat a whole jar of the 2nds food and still want more. he had to be cut back because he was being fed 4 times a day, plus like 5 milk bottles a day. he was getting fatter by the day. he now gets cereal w/ a 1/3 of a jar fruit for breakfast.he gets a 1/3 of a jar of veggies and a 1/3 of a jar of fruit for lunch. and he get the same for supper. he gets 3 to 4 bottles of milk during the day. at other times during the day if he acts hungry, he is really only thirsty, so he gets a water or juice bottle.(4 ozs.) his doctor said that it is working out very well for him and he is gaining the weight like he is supposed to now. before, he was gaining too much. his doctors says that" a mother knows her child more than anyone else could." so, my point is...you know your child. just watch to make sure that he doesn't put on too much weight too fast. excess weight can cause other problems. GOOD LUCK. and by the way, my grandson is a very happy baby now that his eating schedule and amounts have been adjusted to him. he sleeps all night and takes 2 good 2 to 3 hour naps each day.</td>

<td>Has anyone had a child/children that has had the virus roseola?</td>
<td>Roseola (also known as sixth disease) is a viral illness in young children, most commonly affecting those between the ages of 6 months and 2 years. Almost every child has had it by the age of 4.  

Symptoms are a high fever, followed by a distinctive rash just as the fever breaks.  The child usually develops a mild upper respiratory illness, followed by a high fever (often over 103 degrees) for up to a week. The child may be fussy or irritable, have a decreased appetite and swollen lymph nodes (glands) in the neck.  

It is contagious and spreads via droplets from the nose and throat.  The disease seems to spread BEFORE the symptoms develop.  The fever lasts from 3 to 7 days, followed by a rash lasting from hours to a few days.</td>

<td>You can't spoil a child by loving them too much--at *any* age!!  Spoiling happens when you give *things* (every toy, everything they see and want in the supermarket), not when you give of yourself.  Babies need lots of love, and that includes *lots* of holding and touching.

There *will* be times in the future when you'll have to say no to her (as I said above, when it's for *things*, not for love--that's the test for "am I spoiling?").  Just enjoy holding her now while she is so cute and cuddly and you are practically her whole world.  If you pick her up every time she needs you, you are teaching her that when something is wrong, she needs to reach for *people*.  Think about what a good lesson this is for when she's a teenager, and her peers are telling her that if something's wrong, she needs to turn to drinking or drugs.</td>

When I've been on holiday with a very small baby - I've simply taken the fold-down buggy stroller and put the baby down to sleep and then gone to out to dinner - very young babies are incredibly mobile and are sometimes easier to transport about than an older child.  

You just have to tell yourself that holiday's are now different when you've had children... you can't party into the small hours, its an early dinner and then back to the room... its a small sacrifice. 

If you do want to spend a little quality time with your partner, then see if you can leave little one at home with family - my husbands parents were always pleased to have their grandchildren for a week.</td>

<td>I believe the worst thing in the world is for someone to loose their child and I'm deeply sorry for your loss.  
My brother died 13 years ago and my mother still cries about it, but she does go on with her life.  
But you can help yourself by going to grievance classes, and being with people who understand, know your loss.
From what I understand is that you just have to go on with your own life and try to feel normal again.  Most peeps do that by being so busy they dont have the time to think about anything else, but that is unhealthy.  You do need counseling of some sort, just to let it all out.  
What I used to tell my mother that she said helped her when she cried was...
Close your eyes, see him smiling in your mind, feel him hugging you back and hear him telling you that he loves you.  Now trust in God that he is taking great care of him and that he wants you to be happy and accomplish all the things in life that God had sent you here to accomplish so that you can go home and be with him again.
Good luck to you.

1. genetic make up of the child.
the characteristics he/she may develop are hugely influenced by the genetic information from his/her parents. this includes physical appearance or disease that he/she inherits from his/her parents.

2.external factors
Externalities, such as physical accidents [breaking a bone], contacting a disease [polio] can affect how a child may grow and develop. these may alter the child's naturally occuring systems temporarily or permanently and stay with him until he grows up.

3.activities of the child
if the child goes out often into the sun, for example, he may get tanned skin. his everyday biking, swimming or runnning may help him/her develop lean and strong muscles. her frequent ballet lessons may help him/her maintain and improve his/her flexibility. piano lessons may help him/her develop tone sensitivity.</td>

You can try putting a white noise machine in his room, some babies find that soothing. Of course check to make sure that he's not a little too hot or a little too cold. Other than that, try making sure that you have a very firm bedtime routine with at least four steps in it (for example: get a bath, nurse, brush teeth, read a book, sing a "goodnight" song, go to bed).

I suggest pumping and giving her breast milk in a bottle - she still gets the advantage of the breast milk but it will be easier and more convenient to both of you.  I can't see that giving it to her by a spoon would be able to get enough in her.  Too early (American Academy of Pediatrics) to start solids so you need to get as much breast milk/formula in her as you can.

Hogwash to the answerer that says girls give up the breast earlier - each child is different and I can't believe that whether they are a girl or a boy makes any difference.</td>

<td>when do you start potty training, if you have a boy?</td>
<td>I think it depends on your son.  My son is 3 and is just learning how to use the potty.  Your son needs to be sending you certain "signals."  Does he tell you when he's wet or soiled?  Does he use words like pee-pee, potty, poopy, etc?  Will he follow you into the bathroom and ask you what you're doing?  If so, try.  Always be positive!  Consistency (from you) is the key.  You have to be ready, too.

My son will not yet poo in the potty at all.  He says he doesn't know how.  I finally had to put him in underwear to get him to use the potty for peeing.  He just didn't care if he pee'd in his diaper.  When he was wet in his underwear, he didn't like it.  Although he still has accidents, we see improvement in NOT using pull-ups or diapers.  We also decided not to have him run around naked either because he really didn't care if he pee'd on the floor.  He just watched us clean up the mess.  It was more effective to have him wet himself (in clothes) so that his playtime was interrupted to get changed.  He realized it was quicker to just go in the potty.

<td>To mothers: How long did you breastfeed? My boy is almost 7 mths.?</td>
<td>I went to about nine months, at which point both my kids started to be distracted by other things and lose interest.  Pediatricians recommend twelve months, if you can do it.  If you need to stop breastfeeding before 9-12 months, you have to switch to formula, not cow's milk. 

After several months of exclusive breastfeeding, most kids won't take a bottle.  Unless you need to put him on a bottle for some reason--i.e, if you're returning to work--go straight to the sippy cup.  There's no reason to switch to a bottle in between there, other than to make it harder on yourself.  Think about it--you'd have to wean him twice, once from the breast, and again from the bottle!

At seven months, you can give him jar baby foods and some water or juice in a cup.  Do this right before a feeding so that he'll be hungry enough to take this strange new stuff, and then when he's had a bit, nurse him.  He still needs to get plenty of milk.  (He's not ready for cow's milk until about 9-12 months.)  

If he really chows down on the jar foods, you can nurse him first and then stop him before he's done so he can get his "real" food--whatever order works best to get your baby to take both.

When he eats a variety of foods and takes a cup, and when he's ready to have milk from a cup, you can start gradually cutting down on the breastmilk.  Don't force it either way, just pay attention to your baby's signs.  Does he still like nursing, or is he turning his head away to look at the rest of the world?  He knows what he needs better than you do, so watch the signs and be ready.</td>

<td>How can I get my son's blocked tear duct to clear up?</td>
<td>If your baby is born with a blocked tear duct, it will usually clear up on its own by 1 year of age. 

You can help prevent infection in your or your baby's blocked tear duct by keeping the eye clean and using gentle massage techniques. Wash your hands before and after touching the eye area.

To keep the eye clean:

Wipe away any drainage around the eye. Moisten a clean cotton ball or washcloth with warm (not hot) water, and gently wipe from the inner (near the nose) to the outer part of the eye. With each wipe, use a new or clean part of the cotton ball or washcloth. Keep a supply of clean cotton balls moistened with water in a sealed plastic bag for use when you are away from home. 

If eyelashes become crusted with drainage, clean them with a moist cotton ball using a gentle, downward motion. If the eyelids become stuck together, place a clean, warm, wet cotton ball over that eye for a few minutes to help loosen the crust. 

Massage should only be used under the advice and direction of a doctor. Usually, it is done 2 to 3 times a day for several months.

My daughter had to have a simple surgery to resolve her blocked tear duct when she was 18 mths.

Most babies born with a blocked tear duct will not need surgery. However, when surgery is necessary, a simple probing procedure is usually used. Probing involves passing a thin wire through the blocked tear duct to open it.</td>

<td>I remember changing my younger sister's diaper a couple of years ago. I think the crystals might be from the material inside of the diaper. It's a component that absorbs moisture that looks like a crystal but isn't hard or sharp. 
I wouldnt worry about it too much, maybe try another brand or changing the diaper more frequently?
Hope that helped :)</td>

<td>It's better to have gaps between the baby teeth.  It leaves more room for permanant teeth to grow.  

If it really concerns you, schedule an extra appointment with the doctor.  If he thinks it's unusual, he will refer you to a dentist.  Otherwise wait until her 12 month check-up and bring it up with the doctor then.  He will be able to tell you if you need to take her to the dentist early.

There's not much the dentist can do about it unless her other top teeth don't have enough room to grow.  All he can do then is pull the front ones early and put her in braces when all of her permanant teeth grow in.</td>

Do you have a potty?  if so, try putting it in the corner she likes to wee in.  Or if she goes to that corner, take her to the bathroom.  Don't bother with Pull-up nappies they don't work, the kid doesn't get that they are not supposed to wee in it like a normal nappy.  

Take her to the toilet every half hour or so, whether she needs it or not.  Sitting there might encourage her to go.  You must make it fun, though otherwise they won't want to do it.  Stickers or sweets for wee's works REALLY well.  Make sure she doesn't fall down the toilet ever, so many little girls are really scared of the toilet as they have fallen in at some point.</td>

We have seen the unimaginable and have experienced a parents worst nightmare but in reality it can happen.  Obviously the chances of the baby doing well will go down the earlier they come into the world.

My husband was the best and for the 1st week, got up so I could heal and get my rest.  He did this w. both of our kids.

I also felt a sense of, what to call it, importance and with that some trepidation.  I was now responsible for a tiny life.   I didn't want to screw him up.(probably some PPD w. those feelings)

It sounds corny but I prayed to God for wisdom and patience in dealing w. my child(ren).   I feel that patience is one thing i do have and do well.  With prayers and support, this can be done!

Next I stopped the one after her morning nap and went directly to lunch so that she always has something taking it's place.  This is as far as I've gotten.  Sometimes in the morning I don't give her one if she ate a few hours before she got up for the day... say she woke up at 5:00 I won't feed her when she gets up at 7 or 8 I go ahead and gave her breakfast.  A friend of mine suggested that I begin reading her a book before her naps so that when I take that feeding away we'll rely on the book reading as the transition into nap time.

<td>My 3 mo. old has phlegm in her throat from acid reflux.  How do I clear this out?</td>
<td>For the acid reflux (my daughter has as well)It helps if you place a rolled up blanket or towel under one end of the crib mattress. It gives it an incline to help keep the acid down. also, lessen the amount that you feed them just before bedtime. Example: instead of feeding a full bottle all at once, feed them 1/2 and then wait 30-40 minutes and feed the other 1/2. It keeps their tummy from getting overly full, so less acid with come up past the esophagus.  The pediatrician recommended these to me and it does help. Another mother recommended to me also to try mixing a small amount of infant rice cereal in with the bottle. The theory is that it will be thicker, so it won't come back up so easily. From what I've heard it's pretty popular. I tried it but didn't notice a difference.

To help get the phlegm our of the throat and nose... warm baths work great. Try closing the shower door/curtain around you and the baby to keep the steam in. Of just sit in the bathroom with the baby for a few minutes a couple of times a day with the shower running really hot water, so the room gets really steamy. The steam helps break the mucus/phlegm up. Johnson &amp; johnson makes a wonderful bath time baby body wash for colds. It has a little eucalyptus and jasmine in it. It help sooth the throat/chest and the jasmine helps the baby relax. Good to use before bed time.</td>

It's important that he has a healthy, varied diet, not what stage of baby food he is on.  I would just stick with the baby food until he's ready for finger foods.

<td>I had to go back to work when my oldest was 4 months old.  I worked opposite shift from my husband, so it didn't bother me much to leave her with him.  The only thing was that she wanted the bottle more than my breat.  That broke my heart!

It hurt worse when she was about 10 months.  By then I was tired of never having time as a family and I felt I could leave her with my aunt.  I changed shifts.  I cried every morning!  It didn't matter that she loved my aunt and I knew my aunt took good care of her.  I still felt bad about leaving her with someone who was not her parent.  

After a few months I got over it, and I felt a lot better about leaving her when she was 1 1/2 years and she could express herself more.</td>

<td>questions about 3 month old baby...?</td>
<td>A baby's first tooth usually makes an appearance between the ages of 4 and 7 months.  

It is normal for a baby to perspire a lot so lack of air conditioning has nothing to do with it.  If you use a fan, do not direct it at the baby...just let it cool the room itself, but keep it out of line with the baby to avoid chills.

As for feeding, it is best to feed the baby on demand.  That means when the baby wants fed and as much as he wants to eat.  That way, he learns to tell when he is full.  The times he wants to eat will gradually get further and further apart and he will increase his feeding amounts as the times adjust and as he grows.</td>

<td>To tell you the truth a 2 month old doesn't really play much. They are just starting to interact with others at this point. They are smiling and coax a smile from others. They are interested in people's faces and reaches out for it. THey will 'hold' a rattle though. Babies are tight-fisted at this age and if you place a rattle in their hands, it will be a source of amusement especially once he/she hears the rattling.  That said, a mirror will be good. There are toys with mirrors that will be excellent. Buy ones with contrasting colors. Babies love bright contrasting colors.</td>

<td>I just gave birth 2 wks ago, What do I do if my baby cannot tolerate any formula, not even lactose free?</td>
<td>I assume that you are returning to work after 6 weeks off.  Most, if not all states require a Dr's note saying it's okay to return AFTER 6 weeks, but not before.  If you can't pump to save breastmilk for your baby, then try doing the Enfamil with Lipil.  I've had 4 children that all seemed lactose intollerant and hard to take formula, but this worked on my last three.  My first one was so long ago that they don't make that he needed.  If your baby spits up, try lessening the dose of formula.  i.e.  instead of 4 scoops formula to 8 oz water, try 3 scoops to 8 oz.  IF that doesn't work, go down to 2 scoops.  My DR was the one that told me this.  Just increase the baby's feedings like instead of every 2.5 hours, go to every 2 hours or 1.5 hours.  Littler doses in between less time and she'll get the same nutrition.</td>

by 9 or ten months i'd go to mixed grains and at 10 months, you can start her on table foods like any kind of bread (no spices on it or butter), mashed potatoes, stuff like that...
by 11 months, i had my baby girl on just table foods and breastmilk...she ate veggies out of the can (i'd sweeten it with brown sugar--no chemicals) and fruits in or out of the can...just make sure they're in fruit juice and not sugar juice...

1.New hearts are not as purple, they have more clear area with streaks of purple The Preemie Purple Heart is born of an idea borrowed from the US army, a medal given for being wounded in battle. What bigger battle is there than the battle for life and the wounds of premature birth live on with the infant and family forever. The color was once reserved for royalty, making it special and it is gender neutral. The heart is not a solid color and the strips in each heart are a little different, just as every child and every journey is a little different, but the basic design is the same just like the basic experience is the same. The heart is made of glass it is strong but not so strong it could withstand a crushing blow. The premature child is strong but not invincible. It is a heart because the heart is our center, it's every beat renews life and hope, it symbolizes love. At the bottom of the Preemie Purple Heart is a teardrop, it is symbolic of the tears shed during the journey of a premature family, good and bad, joy and sorrow. (reprinted with permission)

2....perfect little preemie angels for your open warmer, incubator or crib. Each pink, or yellow machine washable angel has his or her own very official set of wings. Each angel is embroidered with "God Bless Baby." Your angel can sit right next to you and keep watch!</td>

Carnation is a good formula to go with if you want to wean your baby. Its not as strong tasting or smelling as some of the other formulas. Check with your pediatrician. Most of the time, after 12 months, you can feel free. I would avoid cow's milk for as long as possible. I mean ice cream here and there or some other things with regular milk isnt going to end the world but I wouldnt put a baby on it until about 24mo. Give them as much time as possible to establish a good digestive system and avoid allergies.

<td>What age is a good age to start introducing solids to a breastfeed baby, she is 4 months now.?</td>
<td>IF baby is ready, you can start now. It is recommended to start between 4-6 months.  

I myself started my son on baby cereal when he was 4 months old. My son is big (always in the 95th percentile) so he's a big eater. He gobbled up rice cereal with breastmilk. 

Start with rice cereal (a couple of tablespoons at first) and see how she likes it. If she likes it, then you're off and running. Stay with this for about 5-7 days, then introduce another kind of cereal, or fruits and veggies. Just remember to introduce 1 kidn of food at a time and stay with it for 5-7 days and watch for any allergic reaction. If there isn't, then you're off to a new one. 
If your baby doesn't take well to the baby food, put it away and try again in a couple of days.</td>

<td>Is it true that womens Vagina becomes broader after giving birth ?</td>
<td>As a Mom myself, I can tell you that yes, it does stretch to some degree to accomodate the child, but within a few weeks, it will return to normal. This is true especially if she performs her pelvic floor exercises called Kiegels. A man cannot tell whether a woman has had a child or not by how 'tight' she feels against his penis. And because some women tear, or have a small incision cut into the perinium during childbirth, the stitches may actually make her vaginal opening smaller than before. The perinium is the space between the vagina and the anus commonly referred to as the 'taint', and sometimes cannot stretch far enough for the baby's head to slip through. That is why it may tear or need an episiotomy (surgical cut).</td>

Oh ya, but still use formula for the main source of nutrition, and don't hesitate to give him water to drink.  Sometimes babies are thirsty when they seem hungry.</td>

<td>does music have a great inpact on a childs/infants devolopement and character???</td>
<td>Its not the music itself, its the ideas the lyrics imply. My friends toddler is growing up listening to eminem and other rap. I like eminem, but the kid picks up the swear words that his parents dont let their friends say around him (whats the difference right?) He used to be a real sweetheart, before he learned english, but now he's become quite violent - hitting and kicking animals, children his age and adults. He talks about guns and killing people, hating fat chicks and calls everyone Tigger with an "N" instead of the "T". All of which arent good subjects for 3 year olds to have in mind. They should be thinking about cartoons, and being an astronaut, and loving thier pets instead of intentionally trying to hurt them. Though it plays a big part, I dont blame it all on the rap music they have playing constantly on the TV or radio. I also blame it on bad parenting and no dicipline. They both let him do and get what he wants ALL the time, and the punishment goes to the extent of a very light pop on the kids diaper.

So, Yes, I believe that music has great impact on a child's character. But I would choose to give the child a variety of music, instead of just eminem and other rap. Give him a little country, a little rock, and some classical also - you dont have to like just one kind of music. Thats like saying you can only like one kind of food. 

It would be cool if you could get songs without the lyrics. That way you wouldnt have to deny your child any type of music because of the ideas it implies. Good music is good music, the kid should be able to experience it all. 

I say, compromise with your wife. Mix a CD of eminem songs that she can live with, and that dont promote ideas of hatred and violence so much - such as the songs about his daughter. 

I heard "The Wiggles" is a good childrens music group. They have modern sounding music with child-friendly lyrics.

If you're religious, theres gospel rap you can find. It has the same feel as regular rap, but talks about god and life values, instead of horny b*tches and poppin a cap in someones A55. 

A good video to rent is Disney's Fantasia. It provokes different "good" emotions, and helps the child develop creatively - due to the different music themes, and fantastical images.

Anything Disney, as a matter of fact, is good for babies. You can get CD's of soundtracks to certain movies. Or just download some good Disney songs on the internet and burn a CD of them - like Circle of Life, Colors of the Wind, etc.</td>

<td>Are walkers safe for infants?</td>
<td>Two issues regarding walkers...

1) Safety: Make ABSOLUTELY sure the kid isn't going to walk his walker down a flight of stairs.

2) Leg development: Pediatricians have suggested that the legs of a infant (under 1 yo) are not strong enough to support the weight of the child yet. When the child is in a walker, the weight of his body may cause his/her legs to not grow straight and cause bowing or buckling. 

Regardless of what I say or what others may answer, please talk to your son's pediatrician about this issue. They will know best (certainly better than 'some parents').

EDIT: On a side note, don't be in a rush to get your kid to walk. When they are ready, they'll stand up and walk. Just remember, the sooner they walk, the sooner the damage will start (ie, glassware, dishes, ornaments, vases, etc)</td>

Protein Hydrolysate formula (Nutramigen, Alimentum) are for babies with milk protein allergies.  These are very expensive and something you probably don't want to use unless you absolutely have to.
Don't switch to a low iron formula without talking to your doctor!  Babies need iron!!!</td>

don't worry about it...he'll grow out of it soon enough...what i did was i would put my daughter in the swing and eventually, she got so comfortable that she would fall asleep in there...that was the only place she slept...then one day i put her down in her crib so i could go do something in the kitchen and the next thing i knew, she was sleeping there...
i may be wrong, but based on how it happened with me, babies will tell you when they're ready for change...it's not a bad thing that he wants to sleep on your chest...in fact, it's vital for him to feel as much human skin as possible for survival sake...a baby can actually die if it feels neglected...
it'll probably only last another couple of weeks, which you're not supposed to be up and doing stuff anyway, so use the time that he's sleeping on your chest to get some rest at the same time...</td>

<td>how can I get my kids to sleep throught the night???</td>
<td>You say kids, but you don't say the ages. This question is specifically under "newborn/infant" so I will answer accordingly...

Good luck, my first two slept through the night within the first month or so, randomly and not every night. This one, my 9wk old is very fiesty and has had her days and nights mixed up since birth and actually even before birth. She was always very quiet during the days and active at night and so this behavior continues. Against the information I read, I have started giving her a cereal bottle at night. Rice, of course..you should ALWAYS start with rice. It is extremely unlikely to cause an allergy or sensitivity. 

I tried spoon feeding her and she did eat it off of a spoon but not as much as I would have liked and not as much as I knew she could eat. So I widened the opening on a Stage 2 nipple (I don't breastfeed) and mix about 3 - 4 T of the rice cereal with 8oz. of formula and she drinks it, almost complete and most nights she sleeps through the night.</td>

The first thing she wanted was a stool sample (no one else asked for one). 
My son had a roto? virus.  She put him on antibiotic and within 24 hours the diarrhea stopped.  She was his doctor from then on.

<td>What is the grossest thing youve taken out of your babys mouth?</td>
<td>Oh honey! I got some stories too!
My oldest child who is now going on 6 had a week that I will never forget.
 When she was just about 18 months, we went to a museum. While we were having lunch, I noticed that there was some change missing from the table... Sure enough, I heard something clanking around in her mouth. I saw the copper, and then it was gone. I nearly had a heart attach! But the doctor said just to watch out for it, and that it should pass in a day or so.

A couple of days later, she had gotten into some A&amp;D diaper ointment. Not only was there a complete mess on my floor, but there was even more in her mouth. I had to call poison control per doctors orders. I was mortified by my lack of parenting skills...

The icing on the cake is when the following day, I was feeding my youngest who was about 6 months old. I could smell a heavy peppermint smell coming from my room. It did dawn on me until I heard my oldest coughing... She had gotten into my purse and eaten about 40 altoids! She ate the whole container!!!
I called the doctor since those things are potent!!! He demanded that I call poison control AGAIN. For the second time in 24 hours, I was calling poison control... Turns out that peppermint oil is poisonous when taken in large doses. She was fine in the long run, but had massive bowel movements for about a day or so...

I think it's a normal thing... All kids get into things, and they eat anything they can get their hands on... She's going to be 6 and I still find her chewing on her toenails!!!

Good luck. I hope this boosted your moral!</td>

<td>We cannot get our 1 year old baby to sleep all nite.  How can we change that?</td>
<td>well, first of all, I'm in the same boat. My son is now 13 months and still wakes up 2-3 times a night. Although he doesn't fully wake up. He cries and if I give him his pacifier, he stops and goes back to sleep. But I do this about 3 times a night every day. If he happens to cry and no one responds to him, he cries even more and then it takes him longer to fall asleep.  But my solution is that we co-sleep. My son sleeps in between me and my husband. Before when my son used to sleep in his crib in his room, it was hellish for me to get up several times a night. By co-sleeping, we can all sleep in harmony without exhaustion. 

It's the child's temperament why they are like this. My son is high-need. If you want to know if your baby is high-need, and what you can do to adjust so that you're not exhausted, visit http://www.askdrsears.com . Dr. Sears is an advocate of co-sleeping especially for high need babies.</td>

<td>Cereal is a good way to start introducing food--a little texture, no strong taste, easy to swallow.  I started all 3 of mine on it around that age and 2 liked it--1 waited and we tried later.  Right now your baby doesn't need it for nutritional value, but it's good to try things now so that she won't be as picky later.  Try about 3 tablespoons with as much formula (or water) as you want (depends on how thick you want it).  I would start with rice only.  There is less chance of allergic reaction (rarely happens with cereals anyway) and is easier to digest.  Also, it's thinner.  Good luck!</td>

If the symptoms don't return, it was probably just an an irritant, such as dust, lint, or whatever.  If you notice any drainige, particularly if the baby has matted eyes after a nap or a night's sleep, then it is probably an infection which will require a prescription antibiotic eye drop or ointment.

In general though, for swelling I would recommend cool compresses, as warm washcloth or compresses increase the blood flow to an area and therefore may increases redness or swelling.</td>

we're talking here about an infant, with much smaller body weight, and possible contamination of their primary source of nutrition.  Their livers (which detoxify) are not as developed, either.
And adequate testing has not been done on what poisonous effects hair dye might have on an infant, but gee, just doesn't sound good, huh?

And in the last 6 weeks she hasn't had a reaction to egg yolk.  (I have yet to try dairy, but yogurt is next.)

<td>Yes! Breastmilk carries drugs (including nicotine) through to the infant. Just like humans can get all sorts of contaminants through cow's milk based on what was injected into the cows or fed to them! That's really sad. If the mother smoked through the whole pregnancy, there would also be withdrawal after the baby was born, since s/he was getting the nicotine via her bloodstream. Damn. Smoking and producing babies is SO SAD!</td>

<td>Potty Training for 13 months old Baby girl.?</td>
<td>I also have a 13 month old baby girl. Here's what I do. They are a little to young to completly potty train. But Every morning when she wakes up good (after she cuddles and is ready to play) I take her diaper off and put her on the potty. Because you usually always have to go when you wake up also she has had that nice warm diaper on all night and when the air hits her she will go. I get her off as soon as she uses the potty (that way she knows that you pee not play). Also, if your baby grunts when she poops (so you know she is using it) run and put her on the potty so she poo's in the potty not her diaper. This has worked so far. We have been doing it for about 6 weeks and she goes to the potty every morning now because she knows I think maybe in a month or so we may try it some more</td>

<td>When introducing solid food to baby, how much food should I start with?</td>
<td>Solid food is recommended at about 5-6 months of age. When you first introduce solid food, start with rice cereal as it is easier to digest than other cereals. Use formula or breastmilk with it and make it a little runny at first. Make about 2 tablespoons and see how it goes with your baby. If your baby loves it, chances are, your baby will finish the whole thing. If your baby doesn't like it, put it away and try again a couple of days. But a couple of tablespoons would be good to start with. Add more if your baby really loves it.</td>

<td>Yes it is OK.  When my boy was three months we just could not satisfy him on milk alone.  The so called expert advice was just changing here (UK) to say not until six months whereas it had been four.  Sod that for a game of soldiers, our baby needed solid food now, it was obvious as hell.

We started giving him creamed rice and creamed porridge.  What a difference.  Suddenly he was happy at meal times, suddenly he was satisfied.  Go with your instinct.  Every child is different.  If you believe your child need food, give him food.  Smooth and wet as possible and don't switch over in one go.  We introduced it to him two or three spoonfuls at a time.  It was just to supplement his milk but boy did it make a difference.  

For medical reasons we had to switch to formula after six weeks, don't know if that had anything to do with it at all but the milk stayed as part of his diet until he was over a year and my 18 month girl is still on it at night and first thing.  Trust your instincts, they are more reliable than any expert.  You will know when their advice needs to be used but remember, it is just advice.</td>

<td>I doubt very much that people can answer your question. Most mothers, including me, don't think about baby's nutrition in terms of calories.

Most pediatricians don't recommend solid food until about 6 months. You should exclusively be feeding formula for now. If you will continue with the solid food, you shouldn't substitute solid food for the formula.  Nutrients mostly come from milk, for baby's brain development. Solid food at this young age is mostly for caloric needs, but since your baby probably hasn't been moving much and barely holding herself upright, then it's not needed yet.

If you really want to know how much calorie you're giving yoru baby, look at the packaging. There are calorie specifications on each food, formula you use.</td>

<td>why the woman after give birth she must wait for 40 days then she can have sex ?</td>
<td>You may be surprised to learn that the restrictions regarding resumption of sexual intercourse after birth are largely a result of "folk wisdom." There are no research-based studies that show an ideal waiting time. Women should be given the freedom to chose when they wish to resume sex after birth. 

It is observed that it takes approximately six weeks for the uterus to return to "normal" size after vaginal birth. So, early "authorities" felt that the proscription against intercourse should coincide with this landmark. 

What we actually see in practice, however, is that some women are emotionally and physically ready for intercourse much earlier. Williams Obstetrics, a respected text, states: "following an uncomplicated delivery, a six-week abstinence from intercourse makes little sense. It can be safely resumed in as little as three weeks or when comfort can be maintained". 

From your description, it sounds as if you may be ready for intercourse far earlier than some other women. If you have had no tearing or episiotomy, and your lochia (bleeding) has changed from red to pink and is scant in amount, it is probably fine for you to resume sexual relations as soon as two weeks postpartum. I would advise this additional week to assure the healing and closure of the cervix. 

You will want to protect yourself from another pregnancy by using a contraceptive method. 

You should not resume sexual relations if you have any fever, malodorous discharge or red bleeding. 


For some women, it takes much longer than six weeks until they are ready to make love. Advice should be provided to women based on individual variations. 

A review entitled "Sexuality during Pregnancy and the Year Postpartum" was published in The Journal of Family Practice (1998) by J. Byrd et al. 47(4), 305-8. It reported that "there is little agreement in the findings of research on the resumption of sexual activity following childbirth". They state that "at five to seven weeks postpartum, only 50 percent of women had resumed intercourse.” Numerous reasons have been suggested for the delay in resumption of vaginal intercourse after childbirth. The principal ones are: pain related to an episiotomy; vaginal bleeding or discharge; fatigue and discomfort related to inadequate lubrication of the vagina, due to low levels of estrogen in the postpartum period. 

Women who have had a lengthy labor following a high risk pregnancy or women who have had a birth assisted by a vacuum extraction, forceps or cesarean, may not wish, nor perhaps should they, resume intercourse until 8 to 12 weeks postpartum, or perhaps even longer. Women who suffer extensive  tearing may not be "comfortable" for several months after the birth</td>

<td>Question about birth?</td>
<td>Birth can be nearly painless or it can be excruciating.  Neither one is at all likely.  For *most* women, it is somewhere in between--painful, but can be dealt with.

You should know that women who have had an epidural *report* higher levels of pain than women who have had natural births.  This is probably because the pain of labor results in a wonderful result--a baby.  You don't *forget* the pain when your baby is born, but it instantly becomes irrelevant because the baby has given it meaning.

On the other hand, if your pain *doesn't* result in a baby (as when you have pain, then an epidural, then many hours later you give birth), the pain is what you concentrate on.

The pain is almost certainly *not* going to be so bad that you want to die.  For most of the labor, you won't be thinking about the baby but about the work you're busy doing.  When you start pushing, you'll probably *feel* the baby moving down, and then it will be different.

If at all possible, I would suggest *not* going through labor by yourself.  Make a friend who would be willing to help you out in labor, or hire a professional doula if you can.  (Even if there is nobody who does this professionally, maybe you can find a mother who you trust who would help you out for a couple of hundred dollars.)  It really does make a big difference!

There are a lot of things that you can do to help with the pain.  Walking, rocking in a rocking chair, warm baths or showers (or even warm compresses on your abdomen or back), holding someone's hand (and *squeezing* hard--don't worry about hurting her/him; that's what they're there for!!) are just a few ideas.  Sleeping in early labor (some women can even sleep drug-free in late labor; it's very individual!) will also help.  Trying out different positions can make a big difference.  If lying down is painful, try sitting up with back support, or walking, or standing on "all fours" and arching your back towards the ceiling.  One of the big reasons to have someone with you is that you won't be able to think of different things to try, and *believe me*, you don't want to spend labor checking a list of things to try.  Your friend or doula can make the suggestions and help you (or even *make* you--I've been there, too!) try them out to see what helps.</td>

<td>It has been over 4 months since I've given birth, and my husband and I haven't been intimate yet. Normal?</td>
<td>Yes.  It's absolutely normal.  For the most part, the new mom is exhausted from adjusting to the new baby in the house, as is the new dad.  Also, as in my case, the new dad took a backseat to the new baby in the house.  The new baby is suddenly the new boss of the house so to speak.  My son (16 years ago) became the center of attention in my life.  I know that may have been wrong at the time but it happened.  Also, your body may not be ready to be intimate.  You may be afraid of getting pregnant again, or the thoughts of childbirth may turn you off to being intimate.  This may be subconsious and you don't realize the actual reason.

My piece of advice, from an old mom, is to make sure and make time for your husband.  Even though your baby now takes up alot of your time, your husband needs some of your time too.  If you're already doing this, WONDERFUL!  If you're not, start now! Make a weekly date night.  Get someone to take care of baby and enjoy each other for a couple of hours.  It can just be a quiet dinner for 2.  But start now or you'll end up like me and my husband with a child that is the center of your world and not know how to interact with each other without your child.  I have had to learn to put my husband first and my child second (within reason of course).

Good luck and don't rush it.  It will come when you're ready!

God bless you and your new family!!!</td>

Language experts are amazed TOM CRUISE and KATIE HOLMES have named their baby daughter SURI - because there is no record of the name meaning "Princess" in Hebrew. According to Hebrew linguists, Suri has only two meanings - one is a person from Syria and the other "go away" when addressed to a female. Hebrew expert JONATHAN WENT says, "I think it's fair to say they have made a mistake here. There are variations of the way the Hebrew name for princess is spelt but I have never seen it this way." Suri can also be translated into a Hindi boy's name, and it also means "pointy nose" in some Indian dialects and "pickpocket" in Japanese.</td>

<td>What do you do when your child's doctor doesnt listen to your major concerns about your baby?</td>
<td>Hi Cute.  I can appreciate your anxiety and concerns about your baby.  This is not my area of professional expertise but I do have one thought for you to consider.

Did this problem start after the introduction of cereal foods? (cereals, breads, wheat, oats, etc.)  The vomiting and weight loss can be an indication of a condition called Celiac Disease (I have this disorder).

Celiac Disease (CD) is caused by an allergic reaction to the proteins in several types of grains (wheat, rye, barley, and sometimes oats) called glutens/gliadins.  This allergic reaction causes an autoimmune reaction to develop in the intestinal tract.  The autoimmune reaction is an attack by the immune system against the person's own cells in the intestines.  This damages the lining of the intestines and leads to malabsorption and weight loss (and all kinds of other symptoms are possible).

Celiac disease is quite common, ocurring in 1 person in 100.  Sadly, most doctors lack adequate knowledge and awareness of this condition.  As a result only about 3% of people with the condition get properly diagnosed in the U.S.

Simple blood tests for certain antibodies can usually make the proper diagnosis.  Occassionally, antibody tests of stool samples are needed.

Treatment consists of absolute avoidance of all sources of wheat, rye, barley and possibly oats (they often get 'contaminated' by the other grains).  Please discuss this with your doctors.  If they are not aware or are strongly resistant to considering the possibility of this diagnosis refer them (and yourself) to the April 2005 supplement of the medical journal "Gastroenterology".  The entire issue is about this disease. You can download this from their website.

Lastly, it won't hurt if you try excluding these grains from your babies diet.  However, you must learn about the many, many hidden sources (wheat flour, 'flavorings', etc) of these grains in foods. Total avoidance is needed.  You will need to make your baby's foods 'from scratch' - fresh fruits, veggies, wholegrain rice, beans, etc. to be sure the foods are 'pure'.

Also, consider the possibility of a dairy allergy and/or a soy allergy.  Which of these is in your baby's formula?

I hope you find this helpful.  Best wishes and good luck.</td>

<td>Poppy seeds and breastfeeding?</td>
<td>Yes, poppy seeds eaten by a lactating mother could cause an allergic reaction to the nursing infant. Other foods that the mother eats that could cause an allergic reaction in the infants are:

-Peanuts, soya, fish, shellfish, eggs, wheat, barley, oats, rye, buckwheat, banana, avocado 
-Linseeds, sesame seeds, and poppy seeds 
-Mushrooms, especially shiitake 

The main allergic reactions that an infant would show after drinking breastmilk from a woman who has eatten poppy seeds are:

-Typically several symptoms are manifested: stomach pain, diarrhea, cutaneous eruptions, etc. 
-In 50 to 80% of infants admitted to hospital with atopic eczema (i.e. with severe eczema, a food allergy is found to aggravate the symptoms) 
-Of gastrointestinal symptoms, the most obvious one is contact allergy around the mouth and lips which appears almost immediately after ingestion and is easy to connect with the food 
-Other symptoms that appear soon after ingestion of the food (loose stools, vomiting) are also rather easy to connect with the allergen, especially if the association occurs repeatedly. 


Your son's crankiness could be due to an allergic reaction to the poppy seed. Usually, the crankiness will go away in about 2-3 days. Make sure, if you decide to eat poppy seeds again, to eat it directly AFTER you breastfeed, that way the chemicals in it will be lower or gone by the time you breastfeed again.

Watch for signs of an advanced allergic reastion, such as trouble breathing.

We overcame all these problems by buying baby 'sleeping bags' you can get at Big W or similar stores. Put baby in the layers necessary for warmth minus one thin layer, then put on sleeping bag. it has a neck hole and sleeves for the head and arms, so baby can't escape. Our baby loves them.</td>

<td>Lyrics to Swedish Cradle Lullaby?</td>
<td>I know the song you probably want is SWEDISH CRADLE SONG

Is it this one by any chance? 

Lullaby and good night, with roses bestride,
With lilies bedecked. 'neath baby's sweet bed.
May thou sleep, may thou rest, may thy slumber be blest.
May thou sleep, may thou rest, may thy slumber be blest.

Lullaby and good night, thy mother's delight.
Bright angels around, my darling, shall guard.
They will guide thee from harm, thou art safe in my arms.
They will guide thee from harm, thou art safe in my arms.

(and these are the original words of brahms in german)

Guten abend, gut' nacht! mit rosen bedacht,
Mit n„glein besteckt schlpf unter die deck'!
Morgen frh, wenn got will, wirst du wieder geweckt,
Morgen frh, wenn got will, wirst du wieder geweckt,

Guten abend, gut' nacht! von englein bewacht,
Die zeigen in traum, dir christkindlein's baum.
Schlaf' num selig und suss, schau' in traum's paradies,
Schlaf' num selig und suss, schau' in traum's paradies.

(without poetic embellishments, this is the direct translationof brahms)

Good evening, good night, covered with roses,
With tiny fingernails hidden, slipping under the blankets,
Tomorrow morning, if god wills, you will wake again.
Tomorrow morning, if god wills, you will wake again.

God evening, good night, watched over by tiny angels,
Who show the little christ child's tree in dreams,
Sleep now, blessed and sweet, look at dream's paradise.
Sleep now, blessed and sweet, look at dream's paradise.</td>

<td>When is it safe to give a newborn water?</td>
<td>Babies don't *need* water until they are 6-9 months old and begin to eat more than just tiny amounts of solid food.  Breastmilk or formula is a sufficient liquid for a newborn.  Any other liquid will just fill up their tummies, and they will not get the nutrition they need to grow.  Talk with your doctor about when to introduce water (usually around 9 months when you are introducing a cup).</td>

<td>is there any treatment for NKH in babies?</td>
<td>If you mean nonketotic hyperglycinemia: This is characterized by poor feeding, failure to suck, lethargy hypotonia, coma, and myoclonic jerks appearing within few hours of birth in an infant with no history of perinatal insults. A burst suppression EEG pattern, elevated plasma glycine, elevated CSF to plasma glycine ratio constitutes the diagnosis of neonatal NKH. 

Molybdenum co-factor deficiency / sulfite oxidase deficiency present similarly with hypotonia, seizures, dysmorphic features and cataracts. Diagnosis is suggested by a very low plasma uric acid and presence of sulfites in fresh urine while aminoacid chromatography shows high sulfite concentration in the form of sulfocystenine.


Progress has been made during the past decade for a better treatment of NKH. Unfortunately, due partly to the disorder's heterogenuity, no absolute cure has yet been found. Sodium Benzoate (SB) has long been used to reduce the excessive glycine in both plasma and CSF, and can results in controlled or reduced seizures and increased alertness. Recent trials of higher doses of sodium benzoate succeeded in normalization of plasma glycine and substantial reduction in CSF. In contrast to earlier reservation among medical researchers upon the role of sodium benzoate in promoting mental development, the experiences among many of our parent members seem to indicate the benefit of sodium benzoate. (Exceptions do occur, though). This seems to be true especially when the children start taking sodium benzoate at high enough dose early in life (within the first years of life). 

Dextromethorphan (DM or DXM) is another principal medication added recently to the treatment of NKH children. It has been found in animal model to prevent neuron death resulting from the brain being exposed to high glycine. Some researches also indicate that DM prevents or reduces seizures. (Personal experience by the author of this webpage seems to confirm both the seizure prevention and the development promotion of DM). However, DM can have relatively strong side effects, especially after long term and regular use. It can cause irritability, involuntary movements, refusal to eat, troubled sleeping and breathing suppression. The side effects are different from child to child, and seem to be caused by substantial difference in the body's metabolism of dextromethorphan into dextrophan. The optimal dose (or practical dose) for each child is therefore quite different.</td>

<td>my 8 month old son refuses to sleep in his crib!?</td>
<td>Children begin testing boundaries almost from birth.  If the baby cries and right away he/she is picked up, they associate the action and reaction; thus they start developing behavior,etc. If you're having trouble getting him to sleep in the crib, try allowing him to fall asleep in your arms or wherever he seems to be comfortable and then transfer him to the crib, when he's in a deep sleep. Does he like soothing music, a particular blanket?...find out things that give him comfort and place that item in the crib wiht him.  He may cry at first, but he will resolve himself to the fact that he's going to have to stay in there and sleep.  The first time might be agonizing for you and baby-he may cry for what seems an eternity.  Let him.  It's good for his lungs and both of your futures!He eventually will realize this is where it's at and fall asleep-in his crib.  Best of luck.</td>

I don't know if your baby was always a "good" sleeper and then all of a sudden she started night waking. I have a 9 month old daughter who has never slept through the night.  I did a lot of research on it and now she is much better.  The key is to figure out what is causing the night wakings, make sure they aren't medical reasons and procede from there.  Dr. William Sears has a great website and he mentions a lot about sleeping.  I think it is the number one problem, or should I say "concern" of parents with small children and infants.  Just when you think you've figured them out, they go changing their routine.</td>

<td>Can you mix breast milk with formula?</td>
<td>You can mix human milk with formula if you choose.  The only thing to keep in mind is that if you give a baby anything other than human milk, it decreases the absorption of some of the nutrients (especially iron) from the milk.  So, for instance, a fully breastfed baby is less likely to have anemia than one who is getting mixed feedings.  In fact, research has shown that babies who get only their mothers' milk for at least 7 months are less likely to be anemic at ages 1 and 2 years.  (See sources.)

If you are giving mixed feedings, it is better nutritioually to have some full breastfeedings and some bottle feedings, rather than give some of each at each feeding.  This will minimize the interference with iron absorption, although not eliminate it.</td>

Tender, swollen gums can make life miserable for your baby. If you haven't found the right teether to ease her distress, try one of these alternatives that worked for BabyCenter parents.

I'm a breastfeeding mom and a friend recommended pumping and freezing the milk in an ice cube tray then putting the frozen milk cube into a mesh feeder bag. It worked well and my daughter loved it. She was an early teether so other frozen treats were out. — Cindy 

The humble washcloth
Cold washcloths were the best because they were easiest to chew on. I also used to put a crushed ice cube inside a washcloth, tie it up, and let her chew until all of the ice chips had melted. — LaTonya

Hands down, my baby's favorite soother is a fresh washcloth soaked in some brewed chamomile tea that I keep cold and ready in the fridge. Also, if you use a cold teething ring, try one with a handle of solid plastic that won't get as cold when she's holding it. — Becca 
Alternative teethers
We recently discovered a vibrating teething "star." I think First Steps makes it. When she bites down, it vibrates, and the baby loves it. The rings you put in the fridge or freezer are "too cool" for her. — Kim

I purchased a Teething Blanket by Munchkin for my 16-week-old son and he loves it. I suggest that you buy two. One can be washed while the other is in use. — Kerry

We found a teether that had a freezable part and a hard plastic handle. Our daughter had a much easier time gripping the not-frozen handle. With all the other frozen teethers, she'd just fling them from her chilly little fingers. — Brenda 

Frozen food as chew-toy
Frozen bagels worked well for my daughter when she started teething. — Chris

Our baby's not taking any solids yet, but we put a few frozen grapes in the baby feeder mesh bag and she absolutely LOVES chewing on it. You can put frozen bananas or even just crushed ice in it. It's a little messy, but the babies seem to enjoy it. — Julie 

Cold and wet
My daughter thwarted all our attempts at using traditional teething soothers. We started keeping a baby bottle full of water in the fridge. Although the water has no nutritional value, the sucking was soothing and the ice-cold nipple was great for her to chew on. Just keep an eye out for A LOT more wet diapers. — Katrina</td>

<td>Baby hiccups aren't really anything to worry about.
Hiccups are the diaphragm muscle contracting and it could be caused by several different things from stimulation to irritation. If you're worried about them, you might try patting the baby on the back, but this can also contribute to them (stimulation). There is no prevention or treatment, but it's thought that feeding them before or as soon as they become hungry (and not overfeeding them) helps. Babies who suffer from reflux are also prone to getting more hiccups.
It's really nothing to worry about, but you should ask your doctor if it's something that concerns you or if your baby is taking any medications (as some medications can contribute to them). Good luck!</td>

Because the sex organs would no longer function, a child could only be concieved artificially, if at all. Therefore if a person who was born male, has a 'sex change' he no longer produces sperm. The testes are removed, but she doesn't get ovaries. If a person who was born female has an operation to become male, the ovaries are removed and no testes are added. Some do have prosthetic testes, but not functional ones. Any child concieved would have to be from a presurgery sample of sperm or ovum. The child would be just like any other child, and could not be carried by a transgendered person, because the proper hormones would not be available or the lack of the neccesary organs would make it impossible. There are no humans with YY chromosome combinations, only XX or XY.</td>

<td>Has your baby ever been prescribed Atarax?</td>
<td>My son just turned 6 months old and also has Eczema.

I am actually very surprised that your doctor has prescribed Atarax. That was not a very smart move, and i would suggest getting a second opinion from another doctor. 

Atarax is mainly used for anxiety and tension, but can also be used to help relieve ittching from an allergic reaction. It shouldnt be used in babies, because it makes them very sleepy, making feeding difficult. 

Atarax is only supposed to be used for less than 4 motnhs, because it can cause breathing problems. Thats another reason that babies shouldnt use it because if breathing problems occur, it can increase the chances of SIDS. 

Other serious side effect include tremors, convulsions, dry mouth, and twitches, all of which are dangerous in babies.


I'm going to be honest with you-Doctors dont always know what theya re talking about. I know this because a doctor gave our first son a food diet to help hoim gain weight, but he ended up getting diabetes from it, and then passing away a few months later. I blame the doctors for their misjudgement. Half the time, doctor just look things up in book or on the internet, and i have actually seen them do this. At my sons doctor's office, they would print things off the internet with information on it about certain medications. Doctors dont always know what they are talking about.

I would try somethign called Psorisis Gel. Its over the counter, and helps with Eczema even in babies. I started using this oon my son when he was about 4 months old. He is now 6 months old and the eczeman is completely gone. All you do is rub a little bit on the area where the eczema is. It has no color or smell, so your dont have to worry about it staining your babies clothes. I bought mine at Walmart.

Good luck in your desicion, and i would strongly reccomend getting a secnd opinion from another doctor.</td>

<td>How should i introduce solids to my baby?</td>
<td>First, is to be sure your baby is ready for solids. How can you tell if your baby is ready for solids? Here are a few hints:

-Is your baby's tongue-thrust reflex gone or diminished? This reflex, which prevents infants from choking on foreign objects, also causes them to push food out of their mouths

-Can your baby support his or her own head? To eat solid food, an infant needs good head and neck control and should be able to sit up. 

-Is your baby interested in food? A 6-month-old baby who stares and grabs at your food at dinnertime is clearly ready for some variety in the food department. 

If your doctor gives the go-ahead but your baby seems frustrated or uninterested as you're introducing solid foods, try waiting a few days or even weeks before trying again. Since solids are only a supplement at this point, breast milk and formula will still fill your baby's basic nutritional needs.


How Should I Start Feeding My Baby Solids?
When your baby is ready and the doctor has given you the OK to try solid foods, pick a time of day when your baby is not tired or cranky. You want your baby to be a little hungry, but not all-out starving; you might want to let your baby breastfeed a while, or provide part of the usual bottle. Have your baby sit supported in your lap or in an upright infant seat. Infants who sit well, usually around 6 months, can be placed in a high chair with a safety strap.

Typically, a baby's first food is a little iron-fortified infant rice cereal mixed with breast milk or formula. The first feeding may be nothing more than a little cereal mixed in a whole lot of liquid. Place the spoon near your baby's lips, and let the baby smell and taste. Don't be surprised if this first spoonful is rejected. Wait a minute and try again. Most food offered to your baby at this age will end up on the baby's chin, bib, or high-chair tray. Again, this is just an introduction.

Do not add cereal to your baby's bottle unless your child's doctor instructs you to do so, as this can cause babies to become overweight and doesn't help the baby learn how to eat solid foods.

Once your infant gets the hang of eating cereal off a spoon, it may be time to introduce a fruit or vegetable. When introducing new foods, go slow. Introduce one food at a time and wait several days before trying something else new. This will allow you to identify foods that your baby may be allergic to.


Foods to Avoid for Now:
Some foods are generally withheld until later. Do not give eggs, cow's milk, citrus fruits and juices, and honey until after a baby's first birthday.

Eggs (especially the whites) may cause an allergic reaction, especially if given too early. Citrus is highly acidic and can cause painful diaper rashes for a baby. Honey may contain certain spores that, while harmless to adults, can cause botulism in babies. Regular cow's milk does not have the nutrition that infants need.

Fish and seafood, peanuts and peanut butter, and tree nuts are also considered allergenic for infants, and shouldn't be given until after the child is 2 or 3 years old, depending on whether the child is at higher risk for developing food allergies. A child is at higher risk for food allergies if one or more close family members have allergies or allergy-related conditions, like food allergies, eczema, or asthma.


Some possible signs of food allergy or allergic reactions include:

-rash 
-bloating or an increase in intestinal gas 
-diarrhea 
-fussiness after eating 

For more severe allergic reactions, like hives or breathing difficulty, get medical attention right away. If your child has any type of reaction to a food, don't offer that food until you talk with your child's doctor.


Tips for Introducing Solids:
With the hectic pace of family life, most parents opt for commercially prepared baby foods at first. They come in small, convenient containers, and manufactur</td>

<td>falling alsleep at the breast?</td>
<td>I put a rocking chair in my daughter's "room" (Wasn't really a room, we just divided our room in half with a sheet.) and would sit in it every time I had to wake up to nurse her. If she had trouble going back to sleep, I could rock her on my chest. I would have to stay awake to rock her of course, and if I slowed down cause it was putting me to sleep, she would start to snuffle on my shirt and wake me up. This made me wake up all the way, because I found that even if I sat down on the edge of our bed to nurse her I would somehow end up asleep with her in the bed. Another trick that helped when I was really really tired was to go to the bathroom first and put a cold washcloth on my face, nothing like that to wake a person up.

As for all the people who talk about how cosleeping doesn't increase the risk of SIDS, you are wrong. There are lab studies and real life statistics that refute all of your arguements. Maybe in other cultures (like Japan and Africa) parents can cosleep with their children, but those cultures have hard beds on the floor with little or no blankets and pillows. The suffocation danger is real and this woman has every right to be worried. I applude you for trying to seek a solution, even though it does make your life more difficult.</td>

Veggies...sweet potato, squash, peas, green beans, carrots
Fruit...Apple, banana, peach, pear (no citrus or berries)
meat...chicken, ham, turkey, beef (be careful with fish!)
no honey, or peanut butter

In fact, it takes your body much more than 300 calories to make the milk, but a breastfeeding mother's body works more efficiently to save energy.  (This, by the way, is another reason to wean gradually--it lets your body gradually adjust to the change back to a non-nursing mother.)</td>

<td>Complelety normal! Once your baby starts new foods, new nutrients and minerals are entering his system, and his stools are bound to change in color, and sometimes texture. For example, my son, who is also just about 6 months old, loves to eat potatoes and peas. When he first started eatting these, his stool turned green with white dots! Be prepared for stool changes every time you change foods. However, if his stools turn mucousy or jet black, contact his doctor, because it may be a sign of an allergic reaction.

The sperm travel through the uterus to the fallopian tubes where they meet an egg that the woman produces each month. If the woman is fertile(ovulating) then the chances of her getting pregnant are far more likely. 

Over several months the fetus developes in the womans uterus and developes into a baby. After roughly 9 months the woman gives birth, which is when the baby is developed enough to survive on it's own outside the womb. The woman goes through a series of contractions, which is when the cervix, and vaginal canal contract to help the child through the "tight fit". After several hours of pushing the child makes it through the canal and the doctor, or the father(perhaps even the mother) cuts the umbilical cord that nutritioned the child for the past 9 months.

There are two kinds of supplementers: the Medela Supplemental Nursing System  and the Lact-Aid Nursing Trainer System, http://www.lact-aid.com/webmap.htm
Formula smells and tastes revolting... you wouldn't drink it if you had a choice, would you? Plus the intake of formula instead of breastmilk is highly detrimental to you child's health. Dr. Cunningham has published research in leading pediatric journals indicating that for every 1,000 bottle-fed infants in the United States, 77 hospital admissions would result. The comparable figure for breast-fed infants was determined to be five hospital admissions. (http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/1999/07/19/formula/print.html)
Make sure you are not in the room or near the room when the baby is being fed. She will smell or sense otherwise you being near which is why she won't take the alternative feeding method/bottle... she knows there is something better (your breasts). 
Please disregard that other peice of advice -- do NOT put sugar on the bottle. Early sugar intake has been linked to childhood obesity.</td>

Sometimes it's gas, and "releasing the wind" (not making that up) yoga maneuver can help, which consists of gently pressing the legs into the stomach and stretching them out again, repeating until soothed. Massaging the feet sometimes works. 

Can be tension of nerves, with lots of possible causes... One big one is dehydration, especially if formula fed, or if the mother doesn't drink enough if breast fed.

May be growing pains; proper nutrition, and being held may be the only help for that.

Over-stimulation/too much noise/attention; more quiet times in the day with a comforting family member, or having sleeping time with mom, dad, etc., or sometime just to reflect and aggregate/take-in their surrounding and thoughts about it.

Maybe left alone too much -under-stimulated. May have rash or other ailment that's more bothersome at times than others... You've just got to always be alert to what causes your child to do/feel anything, at any age of the child's development. Everyone wants their parents to care for them with full knowing of how to "make everything better", and understand and be a compassionate counselor them when they're older.

<td>additional info for prematurity?</td>
<td>I got you some information. My little girl, she's 3 now, was a premie and she is very healthy, smart, active, and is taller than her peers. If you have a premie, good luck and God bless. If you are pregnant and worried, don't be. Just take it easy and try to get rid of as much stress in your life as possible.
Premature infants, known as preemies, come into the world earlier than full-term infants. Prematurity occurs when a pregnancy lasts fewer than 37 weeks; full-term infants are born 38 to 42 weeks after the mother's last menstrual period (LMP). There are many causes of preterm delivery. Sometimes it's caused by the mother's lifestyle choices during pregnancy: smoking, drinking alcohol, using drugs, eating poorly, not gaining enough weight, exposure to physical stress, and poor prenatal care are all causes of preterm delivery. Often, however, the cause is not within the mother's control. The mother could have a hormone imbalance, a structural abnormality of the uterus, a chronic illness, an infection, or several other things that could lead to a premature birth. In addition, preterm delivery is more likely when a woman is over age 35, under age 19, or is carrying multiple fetuses. And sometimes the cause is simply unknown. Premature infants have many special needs that make their care different from that of full-term infants, which is why they often begin their lives after delivery in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The NICU is designed to provide an atmosphere that limits stress to the infant and meets basic needs of warmth, nutrition, and protection to assure proper growth and development. Due to many recent advances, more than 90% of premature babies who weigh 800 grams or more (a little less than 2 pounds) survive. Those who weigh more than 500 grams (a little more than 1 pound) have a 40% to 50% chance of survival, although their chances of complications are greater. Premature infants are prone to a number of problems, mostly because their internal organs aren't completely ready to function on their own. In general, the more premature the infant, the higher the risk of complications. Some complications include hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice) apnea, anemia, low blood pressure, respitory distress syndome, infection, bronchopulmonary dysplaysia, and retinopathy of prematurity.
Premature infants often require special care after leaving the NICU, sometimes in a high-risk newborn clinic or early intervention program. In addition to the regular well-child visits and immunizations that all infants receive, premature infants receive periodic hearing and eye examinations. Careful attention is paid to the development of the nervous system, including the achievement of motor skills like smiling, sitting, and walking, as well as the positioning and tone of the muscles.</td>

<td>Maybe he's teething.  That's why he wakes up at night crying, and nursing him helps to ease the pain. Try to give him some Tylenol.  The babies at this age sometimes get up in the middle of night crying because of teething.  A little bit of baby Tylenol might help.  Talk to your doctor to see how much that you can give to him. My baby does that sometimes. If I see him putting his hand against his mouth crying then I know he's teething.  Hope this answer will help you.</td>

<td>I don't have an infant, but it doesn't take an idiot - one would think - to know not to touch a baby's hands or face without washing hands and not at all if you don't know the baby. If one must touch (which admittedly is almost irresistable) touch a socked toe. I'm interested to hear how people handle this. However, you must do what you can - absolutely. Do not worry about hurting someone's feelings (try to be nice if you can), worry about your baby's health. Do not feel bad, she was the one over-stepping bounds, not you. You are not responsible for that person's feelings, you are responsible for the health of your baby. Of course you also don't want to be a germ freak either!

<td>why is blue a boy color and pink a girl color? Who originated that?</td>
<td>According to the website "Gender Specific Colors," it would seem that
assigning color to gender is mostly a 20th century trait.   It would
also seem that at one time, the color associations were reversed when
color first came into use as a gender identifier.

In fact, this reversal of what we consider "normal" was considered
conventional, even in the early 20th century.

"At one point pink was considered more of a boy's color, (as a
watered-down red, which is a fierce color) and blue was more for
girls. The associate of pink with bold, dramatic red clearly affected
its use for boys. An American newspaper in 1914 advised mothers, "If
you like the color note on the little one's garments, use pink for the
boy and blue for the girl, if you are a follower of convention." [The
Sunday Sentinal, March 29, 1914.]

"There has been a great diversity of opinion on the subject, but the
generally accepted rule is pink for the boy and blue for the girl. The
reason is that pink being a more decided and stronger color is more
suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty,
is prettier for the girl." [Ladies Home Journal, June, 1918]
http://histclo.hispeed.com/gender/color.html - "Gender Specific
Colors"

According to Jo B. Paoletti and Carol Kregloh, "The Children's
Department," in Claudia Brush Kidwell and Valerie Steele, ed., Men and
Women:  Dressing the Part, (Smithsonian Institution Press, 1989).  -
In the United States: "The current pink for girls and blue for boys
wasn't uniform until the 1950's.

It would also seem that Nazi Germany had something to do with the
association of pink with femininity:

"Catholic traditions in Germany and neighboring countries reverse the
current color coding, because of the strong association of blue with
the Virgin Mary...the NAZIs in their concentration camps use a pink
triangle to identify homosexuals. (The yellow star of David is the
best known symbol, used of course to identify Jews. The German system
was quite complicated, using various symbols an colors to identify
criminals, political prisinors, an a whole range of other groups). The
NAZI's choice of pink suggests that it by the 1930s was a color that
in Germany had become associate with girls." - "Gender Specific
Colors"

Here is another site backing the same color history.

"The preferred color to dress young boys in was pink! Blue was
reserved for girls as it was considered the paler, more dainty of the
two colors, and pink was thought to be the stronger (akin to red). It
was not until WWII that the colors were reversed and pink was used for
girls and blue for boys..." - Quote from Dress Maker Magazine
http://www.dressmaker.com/ezine0200.shtml

"Jo B. Paoletti concludes that the effect of color-coded gender
differences (pink for girls, blue for boys) existed oppositely
initially..." - Quote from book review "The Material Culture of
Gender, the Gender of Material Culture" - Winterthur, Del.: Henry
Francis du Pont Winterthur Museum, 1997 - From the Journal of American
History - Please note that this is a cached page as the current page
is different:
http://tinyurl.com/iy31

While there are also myths and legends supporting both or either color
for gender identification, those resources dealing with straight
history date the identification of pink with femininity to the period
of World War II or later.</td>

<td>From personal experience,can you recommend a SAFE toy that encourages a baby in standing up and walking ?</td>
<td>Both my children delighted and advanced well with the use of a "Jolly Jumper"  This is a device that the baby is strapped comfortably into. They then hang on a big spring that can be hung in a doorway or somewhere similar. Setting them at the right height enables them to spring and jump around which brings them a lot of satisfaction as they learn to turn themselves around with it... Not something to leave them in all day, but it also allows the parent to do a few things while the baby entertains itself happily. I believe it assisted their development in standing and walking as it strengthened their muscles without overdoing things too much.
Don't be in too much hurry to advance your child's development as they are not small for very long. An interesting fact is that children develop a lot of their skills in relation to other things they do. I was informed once by a teacher of remedial classes for children that children who didn't crawl very much as babies became bad readers.</td>

<td>Please do not mutilate your son's penis by having it cut.

A foreskin is not a birth defect...your son will be born perfect...you do not need to alter his penis in any way--nature makes it the way it is intended to be.

Men who are not circumsized recieve greater pleasure in sex than men who are circumsized because they have more nerve endings in the head of their penis.  

It is not true it is unclean or harder to clean than a circumsized penis.  It is very simple to clean, I am sure your husband can tell you that.

It is horrible, awful pain for a baby to be circumsized.  They scream bloody murder throughout the procedure, choking and gasping for breath, then fall asleep of pure exhaustion after the procedure.  People that say it does not hurt a baby have not been in the room and watched one done.  The foreskin has to be TORN away from the penis head and then cut off.  Have you ever had your skin TORN?  It is worse than just getting cut.  The shot the babies get for pain does not kill all the pain...and for a useless procedure that is only meant to make the penis look a way women in United STates are accustomed to, is it worth it?

Other than that, pacifier use is a personal decision.  Some families choose to use them thinking that later on, it will be easier to help the baby give up a separate object than a thumb.  Others feel that a thumb is more "natural" if a baby has high sucking needs.  Also, many babies who nurse whenever they need to never need additional sucking.

Last consideration--recent research has shown that babies who usually sleep with a pacifier are more likely to die from SIDS on a night when they *don't* have the pacifier.  So only introduce one if you're willing to keep using it!</td>

As for the plates, cups &amp; decorations (buy green everything)...you can print out those same graphics and paste them to the outside of the cups.  Make a banner with those same graphis on both sides of the sign that say "baby shower" or "Congratulations (name of person)".  Get balloons with pea in a pod &amp; make a diaper cake with that same theme decoration.

I did find a site where they have pea in a pod lots of stuff and you can match that with some plates, cups, napkins..etc that have a pregnant woman in them...real cute.

The doctor said that the air in planes aren't the cleanest so even the healthiest person can catch something. And if your baby catches something bad, at younger than 3 months babies with fever pretty much ends up in a hospital.  After 3 months, your baby's immune system should be mature already. 

Like I said, this is from my pediatrian. A friend of got married a couple of months after I had a baby, and so I was deciding at the time whether to go or not.</td>

Personally, I started my son on juice at about 6 months. I gave him watered down juice. I didn't want him to get used to something so sweet. My son is now 12 months and drinks mostly water. Once in a while I give him juice, but I still water it down. For young babies, juice should be limited to about 4-6 oz a day.</td>

Hope you might find this link useful


Flat feet All babies are born with "flat feet" and have a waddling gait when they first start walking. The high inside arch seen on most adults' feet doesn't start to develop until around two years old and children don't take adult-like heel-toe steps until around three years old. However, if your child still seems to have flat feet by the age of three, see a podiatrist who can prescribe gentle inserts to support the arch</td>

There are those who believe that you can teach a newborn to swim.  There are others who will tell you that it can be dangerous.  I have no personal or professional experience with any of this, but I would suggest you do *serious* research (not asking a bunch of us for opinions) before you risk your baby on something you don't know!</td>

<td>breastfeeding and pierced nipples?</td>
<td>I had both my nipples pierced for approx 4 years, 2 in each side and have taken them out while I breastfeed.  I have left them out for the past six months and am still able to put them back in if I wanted too.  In fact, they excrete more milk than my milk ducts do.  As long as they have been pierced a while, the holes should last.  You may experience a slight infection at first due to the new bacteria in the babies saliva.  This may cause you to be slightly uncomfortable at first, but it will go away.
As far as breastfeeding in general, it is one of the greatest experiences you can ever have once you get past the pain.  With my first, it hurt for at least a month.  I would cry every time I knew it was feeding time, but then all of a sudden evcerything was ok and there was no more pain.  With my second, it too was painful, but I did not find it painful for as long.  With the piercings, your nipples should be tougher.  This should help.  But you can also do some toughening excercises (if you can call them that).  But not for too long of a period of time.  Nipple stimulation can sometimes cause your uterus to start contracting.
Hope this was helpful.</td>

<td>Can any experienced mom help please?</td>
<td>At this age, sleeping through the night typically means 6 hours - so she isn't too far off! You're lucky if you get 8 hours. 

One thing you can try is feeding her a bottle before YOU go to bed. This might help so you get a few extra hours of sleep before she wakes up hungry.

It sounds like she might have a problem falling a sleep on her own. When she cries, let her cry for a few minutes before you go in to her. Maybe she will calm down on her own. I know it is difficult to hear them cry - but sometimes they fall back to sleep. If not, go in and comfort her by patting her on the back and NOT giving her a bottle. If this doesn't work, she may need the extra nutrients so you might just have to give in! You could also try giving her more during the day. If babies are hungry they will eat. If not, not! She is only 7-months old so you may still have a couple months before she really sleeps through the night. Enjoy the night time quiet with her while you give her a bottle. It will be over soon enough.</td>

your baby might not have this but i would have them check anyway. beware they will ask you alot of questions as this usually happens when somone wants to hurt the child. ( i know you didnt but they might not, im a mother of two under two) Also for the vomiting do not let them give your child fenigrin. It is directly linked to child death. it is not to be givin to any child under the age of two.

<td>It is the same as Reglan which has been used for many years to increase milk supply.  It is generally very effective, but it can have annoying side effects.  A better drug is domperidone (at least as effective, but fewer side effects), but it is not available in the US, and the US government--at the behest of the US drug manufacturers--are trying to oulaw its use and importation.

However, I would strongly suggest that *before* you look for ways to increase your milk supply, you talk to an expert.  Many women who think they have too little milk actually have too much.  Some things that are *not* necessarily signs of too little milk include baby not gaining weight (this *can* be a sign of too *much* milk!!), baby fussy at the breast, can't pump much milk, breasts no longer feel full (this is most often a sign that things are going well), etc.  Before you do anything else, please contact La Leche League; they give *free* help to mothers with breastfeeding questions.

Is the spit-up primarily swallowed drool or mostly milk? Maybe the volume of drool in his/her belly is overfilling their little tummy.

My daughters did spit up a bit more when teething, but I assumed that it was more attributable to them sticking objects way into their mouths, and perhaps an overactive gag reflex.

As long as he/she is keeping a good amount of their milk down, and gaining weight well, I wouldn't worry too much. This too shall pass :)

<td>What do I need to have for a new born baby?</td>
<td>You'll find a lot of people recommend things that are nice to have but not necessary.  Obviously you need clothes, diapers, wipes, soap/shampoo, car seat, baby nail clippers, and feeding supplies.

Nursing pillows are nice, but any pillow can prop your arm/baby up.  Bouncers can help, but didn't work for my son.  A crib will eventually be necessary, but a lot of babies are happiest sleeping with Mom or in the car seat for the first few months.  Changing tables are easier on your back, but I change my 7 week old on a changing mat that came with my diaper bag.  Baby bathtubs are a good idea, but many babies have been bathed in the sink.  Diaper warmers are a waste of money.

If you're breastfeeding, a pump can give you some freedom.  A swing saved my sanity with both my children.  A thermometer can relieve middle of the night worries (ear thermometers work better on older children.  A newbon's ear canal is too small for an acurate reading).  Along those lines, mylincon drops for gas and baby Tylenol or Motrin (don't wait until you need it).  A dresser (you have to put the clothes somewhere), but a cheap rubbermaid set of drawers from Wal-Mart lasted my son for a while.  Rattles and other toys will become necessary, but for the first little bit your face will be their favorite thing to look at (along with lights, ceiling fans, and large high contrast objects like furniture and the tv).  A sling or some type of baby carrier is a good idea(I have a backpack and a sling and prefer the sling).  I don't use my stroller very often, but I'm glad I have it.  A baby monitor is necessary if your home is large, but can be useful in a small apartment too (it helps me to be able to relax and not rush my shower).  My kids didn't care about a crib mobile at first, but as their vision improved they did like it more.  You will need a diaper pail, but at first (until they start solid food) the diapers don't smell too bad and can be thrown in a regular trash can.  Many hospitals will give you a free diaper bag (I got 2 with my son).  As they grow books will always be a necessity.</td>

<td>Why does my 4 month old daughter keep touching her left ear?</td>
<td>It could be that she has worked out you will pay her more attention if she keeps touching it because she can sense your concern.  Bubs are tricky like that.  My 7.5   month old likes to scream until her sisters pay her attention even though she has been fed, bathed, and changed.  

Check with your doctor just in case.  Also check her temperature to make sure she dosnt have a low grade fever you haven't noticed.

Sounds like all is well though!  Good luck! :-D</td>

<td>How do you get an 11 month old to sleep through the night?</td>
<td>For me to give you a better answer I would have to know your baby's daily routine. If you don't have one, FORM ONE NOW. Routine for a baby is essential and it's beneficial for them to learn from the very start how a routine is something that everyone has. Assuming you don't have a routine, I'll post here my son's daily routine:

8AM: Get up (I wake him up if necessary, no sleeping in)
8AM-10AM: Play with toys, watch morning TV shows that are geared to very young kids. Disney is a good channel.
10AM-10:30AM: Breakfast
10:30AM-1PM: Go outside and play in the yard with toys meant for playing with outside. No indoors toys.
1PM-1:30PM: Lunch
1:30PM-4PM: Naptime. It usually takes him 10-15 minutes to fall asleep if he wasn't very active in the morning, but if he was very active he goes right to sleep.
4PM: Wake up (Once again, no sleeping past time)
4PM-6PM: Play with toys again either indoors or outdoors. I usually let my son tell me if he wants to be in or out during this time.
6PM-6:30PM: Dinner
6:30PM-7PM: Bathtime. Make sure to bring in many bath toys for more enjoyment. I recommend using Johnson's soothing bathe washes to ease your child for bedtime which is right around the corner.
7PM-8PM: Special activity. Usually I will show something new to my son during this hour like playing a new game, or playing with a new toy. This is also an ideal time for story time.
8PM: Bedtime. I put my son in his crib at this point and I rub his back for a few minutes. I sing him a song and when I finish singing, I say good night and close the door behind me. Use a baby monitor; never keep the baby's door slightly open. If it's open he can see outside and he will want to be with you even more. After about 10 minutes of screaming, go in and comfort him, but DO NOT pick him up. After he has calmed down, walk out and close the door. Every 10 minutes go back in and comfort him.

That's how we got our son to take a nice long nap in the afternoon and how he sleeps from 8-8. We no longer have problems sleeping at night and we are happier than ever. Good luck with training yours, it can be hard at times.</td>

You can get different flashing things to put in front of him (I'm not saying he'd be able to play with them yet!).  Just make him aware of different things around him.  THats all you can do.  Different people use different ways to try and help their babies development.  You got to find a  way that suits you best.  Good Luck,</td>

<td>My 10week old baby girl has refused to breastfeed, my milk is reducing rapidly , wot can i do?</td>
<td>I was in your boat 5months ago with my son! He would suck for a minute and cry. I never had a lot of milk to begin with. I used to pump milk into bottles while he slept. I did this for 3 weeks but i was ready to drop by then as i was not gettin any sleep. While he slept I pumped, when he was awake I fed him. After 3 weeks, I was so stresed out, my milk dried up. I was very sad as I know breast milk is the best. I put him on a milk based formula which he was allergic to. I put him on a soy fomula which he was alergic to. Now he is on a lactose free formula which is 25 bucks for a small can! WIth breast milk, there are rarely any allergic reactions to if I were you, i would continue to breast feed! Trying pumping milk and freezing it, that way u get a little break from pumping sometimes. If u are like me and can't keep the pumping up, try to find a formula with nutrients found in breast milk. Hope this helped!</td>

<td>I recently had a baby and had to move in w/ my motherNlaw what can I do about her buttin in on how I raiseBABY</td>
<td>Oy!   My advice is to move out also.  I made the mistake of living with my mother in law for about a year after our daughter was born.  The friction it caused between the two of us is still evident in our relationship today.  That was over 3 years ago.  It not only caused problems between her and me, but between my husband and I also.  

I tried the 'sit her down and talk to her about it' approach several times.  Every time I did she would call me ungrateful.  She even went so far as to tell me that I was a bad mother and she was going to try to take our daughter away from me (because after HOURS of trying to get the baby to sleep I was letting her cry for a minute).  I can tell you horror stories!!!   My poor husband felt caught in the middle and was going crazy too.  

Your husband needs to tell his mother to back off.  It's much harder for you to tell her since she is not your mom and she's much more likely to take it in stride if he says something to her.  

Another thing is that the longer you stay there and allow her to tell you that things you do are wrong, the longer she'll do it after you move out.  Mine continued to show up at our house unannounced for a year after we moved out and to tell me that I was doing things the wrong way.

Every mother has a different style in raising their children.  If yours is a great deal different than hers, she needs to respect that.  The baby is your child, not hers.  She should allow you to do things the way you see fit and, of course, offer advice when it is needed.

So, to recap....  MOVE OUT!!!  AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!</td>

<td>My baby cries all the time shes going to start daycare will they accept her if she cries all the time 5 wksold</td>
<td>Usually the daycare knows a few things that will work but only if they have good caregivers maybe you can ask them for suggestions when she starts. Just be honest with them but usually a daycare will not turn down a baby for crying. Also caregivers are usually busy enough that they can't carry around one baby all day long so she will be able to learn how to calm herself in no time. Also sounds like she may not be getting enough to eat at one sitting. Try nursing until she stops then a bottle of formula until she stops. Then wait at least 2 hours before trying again. You could also give her a little corn syrup for the constipation once daily or even a bite of prunes and pears baby food before her first feeding daily.</td>

<td>When should a breastfed baby sleep through the night?</td>
<td>Every baby is different.  Sleeping through the night is defined as sleeping 6-8 hours.  It may depend on the size of the stomach, but not necessarily.  My 3 month old is breastfed and is sleeping 6-7 hours on average, but can sleep up to 8 1/2 hours at night.  Her larger and older cousin took longer to get to that point.  Both are breastfed.  My bottle fed son was still waking frequently at 6 months.

Try soothing him back to sleep when he wakes up.  If it works, he may just be waking up because he's used to eating during the night.  It takes a while for babies to learn to sleep for long periods.  Stick with it -it does get better.</td>

<td>Doctors say not to...?</td>
<td>as a parent you should always go by your maternal instinct and by your baby's cues. from what you say it sounds like your baby is ready. try feeding him some rice cereal mixed with formula and see how he likes it. if you have been putting it in his bottle all this time he has been already eating it anyway, so if it didn't agree with him you woud have known by now.

also- I was always told not to put cereal in the bottle. its best to feed him the cereal/formula mixture with a baby spon. increase the cereal over time until he can handle the thicker texture.

with my daughter I waited until about 4-5 months but started my son about 3-4 months because he was a bigger baby and bigger eater. I breastfed him not formula and also he drank from a cup not bottle so a slightly different experience.

I also recommend starting with a sippy cup rather then the bottle for things like juice or water so when time to get him off the bottle he will be used to the cup already.</td>

I now live in Japan. and as most places nursing is understood to be the healthiest thing you can do for your child, unfortunately there is a double standard with that. Recently at a restaurant with a friend and her baby, she was asked to leave for nursing in the establishment, and it was explained that it was very rude to do that in public. So, here, it is accepted as the right thing to do for your child, just don't do it while out.</td>

It just depends on the hair and the family history etc.</td>

<td>Has anyone successfully transitioned a 23 month old from crib to bed and have any suggestions for doing so?</td>
<td>We started putting my daughter in a blow up toddler bed just at nap times at 24 mos. and she loved it (I got it at Toys R Us but I think they have them just about everywhere).  It's a blow up mattress with higher sides to keep them from falling out of the sides, and it has a built in sleeping bag - keeps them 'closed in' a little - that can be removed and washed.  

We take it everywhere with us now, so if you (or she) isn't quite ready for a big bed, then it's a great alternative.  We also 'threaten' my daughter when she goes for her nap, telling her that if she gets up or starts playing she has to go back to her crib.  It's worked great and she's now moving into her toddler bed this weekend at 28 months.</td>

<td>How painful is it to give birth to a baby?</td>
<td>I've had five.  I think it depends on your "threshold of pain".  Some people can have teeth filled and get stitches with no painkiller.  Others faint if they touch a hot pan.  Two of my three adult daughters have had five babies between them.  None of us had anesthesia and I'd say my daughters and I are all in the middle "threshold of pain" category.  It HURT don't get me wrong, but for me it was like the worst menstrual cramps I ever had.  Have you ever gotten a "charlie horse" in the back of your leg?  It hurt like heck, right? But if you didn't fight the pain but tried to relax and stretch it out or walk on the leg it slacked off and went away. Labor pains are like a charlie horse from your breastbone to your pubic bone.  I think if you are a mature woman with a loving supportive man and family and a good doctor and you really WANT to get that baby into the world it happens with none of the screaming or thrashing like you see in the movies.</td>

<td>Any suggestions for postpartum depression?</td>
<td>I never had postpartum depression, I had agression.. I hated everything and yelled and screamed and I was like some pycho lady but I didn't cry. These hormones effect us all in different ways. I personally went to group therapy (individual therapy just made me more resentful) because I found talking to other moms going through the same things made me feel normal and once I could except the normality of my situation it went away and I could enjoy motherhood. Birth control... estrogen more specifically also helped balance me out. Depo made it worse... much worse. I know you said besides therapy and meds but niether of these are considered traditional so I figured it couldn't hurt to tell you what worked for me.

Support, without support any kind of depression gets worse.
Keep busy, the less time you have to think the better. Don't be alone with your child if you are having thoughts of hurting them. Realize, believe it or not that these thoughts are common but they can not be trusted. Many post partum mothers experience thoughts of killing, throwing, drowning, snapping the necks of their children... thankfully most of us don't. 
Even if you don't try a support group just hanging out and talking to other mothers can help your situation, realize there is hope and you are not alone. Your baby needs you to pull through this and you can.</td>

In addition to the issue of stitches, your uterus is still healing, even if not still bleeding, and the act of intercourse may introduce opportunistic bacteria, resulting in a uterine or vaginal infection. Your body certainly does not need that after all it's been through!

Now nursing my third baby,( who is twelve months) I am not looking forward to the post-nursing breasts!  You can either look at the changes as a badge, to be worn proudly, or as a negative.

<td>What do you think of women who nurse toddlers in public?</td>
<td>You go girl!  Considering the number of responders who seem to think there's something wrong with nursing a child who can walk and talk, women who continue to give their child the best nutrition possible without hiding away should be supported and admired.  The only way our society is going to become accustomed to this NORMAL behavior is by seeing it over and over, until it is no longer surprising.  And it really is best for the child to continue nursing until physically and emotionally ready to wean, which for most children will be between 2-3 years.  If you doubt the benefits of continued nursing, or think it will somehow harm the child, remember that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breastfeeding should continue for at least the first year and beyond as mutually desired, and notes that there is no upper limit to the duration of breastfeeding.  At this point, many states and the federal government protect a woman's right to nurse her child in public, thankfully since it seems many people would still challenge this right.</td>

Keep in mind that baby mattresses are made to regulations that are safe for baby.  I see no reason to put off immunizations--seems like that is a little extreme.  If you are going to be so stressed about this then maybe you should do research on the percentage of babies affected by SIDS--it is extremely low.  As mothers we are prone to worry, but if we worried about everything that has the slightest possibility of hurting our children we would literally go crazy.

Because many of the diseases that vaccines are for are no longer prevalent here in the US, people are increasingly questioning the need for vaccinations. But for people like me who grew up seeing first hand what some of these diseases can do to a child, I see immunizations as a life saver.</td>

Is your baby growing well? Seem satisfied after nursing? Peeing and pooping ok? If so, then it's probably just a slow down in growth which is totally normal, they go through growth spurts and slow downs which is a very normal human thing to do.

It's good you are not giving your child formula, even one bottle of that stuff can ruin the gut of an infant and it takes 24 hours to get it back to normal! Scary!

ALSO-you don't EVER have to finish 'both breasts' like the poster below. That's mis-information. You just nurse until the baby is done, whether that's one breast or both. I have friends where their baby only nursed on one side and this continued the entire time they nursed (for one friend it was 16 months, for the other it was 2 years) so ignore the 'feed from both sides' post-not true.</td>

But the joys of being a parent definately make every second of it worth it. 

Try taking a few minutes to reflect on what being a parent means to you. Think of all the new, fun exciting things you'll get to experience with the new baby. Give yourself a "can do" aproach. All a baby really needs in the first few months is food, lots of sleep, and most importantly lots of love. Just remind yourself that you "can do" all of that. 

If you have any questions or just wanna chat with another new parent, feel free to email me. Theres a link to do so in my profile. 

Congrats on your upcoming birth. It's really exciting...</td>

<td>Iam 5 months pregnant and can't decide wether I should find out the sex of the baby.?</td>
<td>The only research that I know of that has *ever* been done on parents' feelings said that you will likely be happier if you *don't* find out the sex of the baby.  Mothers who found out the sex of the baby during pregnancy were more likely to be disappointed.  Mothers who found out after the birth that the baby was the "wrong" sex had a real baby to take away any disappointment, while finding out during pregnancy, *all* you have is the announcement of the sex.

As for buying clothes and decorating the room, pick out things you like.  I didn't know the sex of any of my kids.  They wore green, yellow, white, *and* blue and pink (yes, both the boys and the girl).  Always dressing a baby in blue or pink gives you and the world more of an opportunity to stereotype the baby.  As is, I got *really* fed up with strangers telling me that it was a shame my sons were so beautiful "because it is wasted on a boy"!!

Learning the sex of the baby before the birth also detracts from the moment when the baby is born and you hear, "It's a ___" (or even better, when they hand you the baby and you get to see it for yourself!! but if not ask if your husband can do the announcing).

One last consideration.  If you find out, and then it turns out that the results were wrong (which can happen for any number of reasons), will you feel cheated--you spent all the money on "gender-specific" clothes, decorations, and toys, and most of them can't be returned!!</td>

<td>do you think it a good i idea to let your new boyfriend put his name on you baby?</td>
<td>NO! trust me, it is hard enough to put up with the biological dad! You don't want to throw another man into the picture. 
Not to mention from the legal aspect, if you two broke up and you tried to get child support, you would have to go to the legal father, which would be your current boyfriend. All he would have to do is take a paternity test to prove he isn't and then you are screwed out of support for your child. 
Depending on the state you live in, you will not be able to go after biological dad if another mans name isn't on the certificate. 
Your best bet, if you don't want to put bio dad on, would be just to leave it blank.</td>

<td>How can I get my baby to eat something besides crackers?!?</td>
<td>How old is the baby?  If she is less than a year old, the main part of her diet should still be breastfeeding.  (Or formula if you're not nursing.)  The solids are for the experience and fun, not so much for nutrition.  So I wouldn't worry.

In the meantime, her poor mouth hurts, and she doesn't want to eat other foods.  Keep trying, but gently, and she'll almost certainly go back to her old favorites.  You can help by giving her a frozen teething ring before solid food to numb her gums a little.  It also may help to have the foods you offer her be *very* cold for the same reason.  Or some babies find warmth soothing, so you could also try heating them up to very warm (but not hot).</td>

Our daughter has EVERYTHING. Every toy you can think of she's got it (she's a first grandchild!). For the last month or so she has been very bored with them all, even loosing interest in new ones we have just bought for her.
Part of it is that she has started crawling &amp; standing so much preferes to practise them.
Give her an empty coke bottle with the lid off and watch her scream in delight! I g'tee it!!! Or, put some rice in the bottle and do the lid up tight and they spend ours just shaking it! She's never gotten bored with that and still keeps her occupied for 30mins at a time!I've also heard to only let baby play with about 10 items and keep the rest hidden. Then every week or so swap the oes shes got for the hidden ones. It's meant to stop them being bored but it didn't work for us.

Why no walkers too? Our daughter LOVES hers and bombs around the place in it. She loves to be chased too and can even out run me!! I heard it can delay their development of walking/crawling but every baby is different and it certainly hasn't stopped our little girl from learning at a scarily fast speed!

Hope you work it out and have a blast with your little girl!!</td>

<td>Experiences with cloth diapers - pros/cons?</td>
<td>I tired using both cloth diapers and disposable in the first 3 months but I ended up just using the disposables because...

1. When your baby just wont stay put it's hard to put the cloth diapers in! It takes longer and that diaper pin is dangerous.
2. At night, cloth diapers tend to leak for me.
3. Cloth diapers are cheaper and more economical yes but in the end, when you don't have time at all for anything else. Even when you're just staying at home. Taking care of a baby takes most of your time and for me I'd rather spend the available time I have for my hubby or for my other baby rather keep on washing cloth diapers like there's no end.
4. In the long run, the cost of detergents, water and electricity for washing diapers are just the same as the disposables.
5. Lastly, who wants a smelly cloth diaper lying around. That's why the diaper genie was invented. =)</td>

<td>How do I put my seven month old baby on a schedule?</td>
<td>Why do you both sleep all day for one. A baby learn what is day and what it night within a couple of weeks of being born. But anyway this is what you do. When he/she wakes up in the morning play with him/her and then feed him/her breakfast (solid food, formula or breast milk whichever one you are doing) After that you can get a maybe an hour or two of more play time. Around 11 am they will begin to he sleepy, put him/her to sleep before they show signs of crankiness and rubbing there eyes. If they are like this they are over tired. While the child is asleep Try TO STAY AWAKE. Because if you have been sleeping all day with your child them your system is all out of wack also. 

But back to the schedule the child should only sleep for 2 hours and wake up on there own if not wake him/her up and repeat the cycle of the afternoon. A little play time, a feeding, a little more play time and them a short nap. Once he/she wakes up from that nap you can play with him/her but try not to over stimulate them with too much activities. 

You may have or you may not have noticed that around 6 to 7:30 pm that your child naturally gets sleepy. This is the child true bed time. Not 9, 10 and 11 o'clock or when you feel sleepy. Start a routine. Give your child a bath, read them a book and place them in the and they will fall asleep. Some children have been known to scream and cry. But this is something that you must deal with. Stay in site to comfort them but not to put them to sleep. It should take about 5 days in some children a little more. And if the baby wakes up an hour after he/she wakes up treat it like a night time awakening. Comfort them but let them fall back to sleep themself.</td>

<td>why can't babies have honey?</td>
<td>Most honey is not pasteurized, so it contains bacteria that babies can't digest.  That's why you're also not allowed to have unpasteurized honey during pregnancy.  (There is a type of clover honey from Canada's Peace River region that is pasteurized.  It's the only one I've found here, but maybe you have something similar in your area?  Ask your doctor or public health nurse.)  

Anyways, it's not just honey that baby can't have, it's anything that's not pasteurized.  Soft cheeses, like bocconcini cheese, american feta, and some fruit products (jams &amp; jellies, juices, etc) are out if they are not pasteurized.

Your pediatrician (USA), or public health nurse and/or doctor (Canada) should be able to let you know what foods are typically a concern in your area.</td>

<td>Most likely your baby has thrush. Does it look like a little white spot? Does it bleed if you rub it? Most often thrush occurs on the gums though, not the tongue. Thrush is caused by a fungus which can live on Mommy's breasts, in baby's bottles, and in baby's mouth. Take your baby to the doctor and they will give you a medication that your baby can take orally to treat it. If you are nursing, insist that they perscribe a creme for you, so that you do not reinfect your baby and to treat any discomfort that you may have. As for the bottles, sterilizing in hot, hot, hot water is the key, every single time, even though it is a pain. Good luck!</td>

alternitivly boots sell cold water sterilizing bags that you can put bottles and cold water in for an hour to sterilize. take your own buggy and sun parasol this can double up as a high chair and boots also sell a pop up travel cot which is the size of a medium sized hand bag.

<td>Your 1st Birthday

Covered in cake and icing, 
Your smile stretched ear to ear. 
A single candle celebrates, 
The joy of your first year. 

We sing Happy Birthday, 
You play midst wrap and bows. 
We marvel at how you touched our lives, 
Just one year ago. 

I remember the first time I held you, 
Kissed your head, whispered your name. 
You've changed our lives forever, 
Our hearts will never be the same. 

As a child you'll love this day, 
For all the sweets and presents too. 
As parents we'll love your day, 
For the gift we got was you.

Each year we'll add another candle, 
So proud to see you grow. 
But always with the memory, 
Of your first day long ago. 


by Teri Harrison 







Happy birthday son.
You are finally turning one!
No more "Mommy, feed me!"
The fun has just begun.
Soon you will be running, climbing
and jumping everywhere.
And Mommy and your Daddy will be pulling out their hair!
But always remember, when the punishments do come.
No matter what happens.
You are loved, Little one

Author: Shana Gingerich 

What a precious bundle of joy you are
cute from head to toe
You melt our hearts with your sweetness
everywhere you go
You're a golden ray of sunshine
sent from heaven above
A perfect little angel
for all of us to love

<td>Die 
To dream that you die in your dream, symbolizes inner changes, transformation, self-discovery and positive development that is happening within you or in your life. Although such a dreams may bring about feelings of fear and anxiety, it is no cause for alarm and is often considered a positive symbol.  Dreams of experiencing your own death usually means that big changes are ahead for you. You are moving on to new beginnings and leaving the past behind. These changes does not necessarily imply a negative turn of events. Metaphorically, dying can be seen as an end or a termination to your old ways and habits. So, dying does not always mean a physical death, but an ending of something. 

On a negative note, to dream that you die may represent involvement in deeply painful relationships or unhealthy, destructive behaviors. You may feeling depressed or feel strangled by a situation or person in your waking life. Perhaps your mind is preoccupied with someone who is terminally ill or dying. Alternatively, you may be trying to get out of some obligation, responsibility or other situation. 
To see someone dying in your dream, signifies that your feelings for that person are dead or that a significant change/loss is occurring in your relationship with that person. Alternatively, you may want to repress that aspect of yourself that is represented by the dying person. 
Pregnant
To dream that you are pregnant, symbolizes an aspect of yourself or some aspect of your personal life that is growing and developing. You may not be ready to talk about it or act on it.  This may also represent the birth of a new idea, direction, project or goal.</td>

<td>I am also having the same concern with my 5 1/2 month son. He was born with an adnormally large fontanel. I can also see it "pulsate". An ultrasound was performed to check to see if any fluid was in the soft spot since it was so large. Thankfully there was nothing. 3 Peditritions have told me that it can take up to 2 years for the soft spot to completely close.

Gripe water is good for gas reief in babies, or if he burps when he's playing, then let him play after he eats. You could also try laying him on his back and "bicycling" his legs to relieve gas, but that is more for tooting. and not sleeping on his stomach is a good thing. he should be sleeping on his back anyway to help prevent SIDS.</td>

<td>does anyone know of a home remedy for thrush in babies and new moms,help!?</td>
<td>Gentian Violet, I used it for my daughter before I decide to take her to the doctor.  The stuff my doctor gave my daughter seemed to work faster.  

Also if you are breastfeeding, rub some on your nipples after every feeding and be sure to wear nursing pads because it stains.  You have to use it because your baby can give it to you during feeding and make it painful.  

If the baby is using bottles or pacifiers you have to BOIL them all after every use until it clears up!  Use a q-tip to swab the inside of your baby's mouth after every feeding, after you take a SOFT cloth and GENTLY wipe out the baby's mouth (and you need to continue wiping out the baby's mouth to prevent it in the future).  

You can go to a small pharmacy and ask the pharmacist for it.  It is a little hard to find, but it wasn't expencive to buy.  

You do need to treat it soon, because thrust CAN be painful to your baby and it can also travel down the the diaper area.  

I used the gentian violet for about two weeks and then decide to take my daughter to the doctor.  Like I said the meds worked faster and some doctors are now saying NOT to use gentian voliet.  I guess because of some study in Australia as linked it to cancer of the mouth or something.  But some doctors are still using the method.  If you decide to use gentian violet, use sparingly.  It is not to be used for an infant with REPEATED infections or has a resistance to thrush.</td>

<td>need advise on infants sleep....or lack of?</td>
<td>We were pretty fortunate with all our kids...most were sleeping long stretches during the evening by five or six months.  My experience (after four kids) is to keep them awake for longer stretches as they get older.  Gradually wean them off an old sleep pattern by keeping them up for longer stretches (an extra 1/2 hour each week) until they're awake four, five or six hours at a stretch.

While you're doing this, also add cereal to the bottle and gradually increase the amount to where it's about 1 oz cereal to 3 oz water.  You'll need to make the bottle nipple holes bigger to handle this mixture.  This will keep him "full" and extend the periods before he gets hungry again.

Finally, don't try to keep the house too quiet.  Let him get used to the sounds of his surroundings while he's sleeping so nothing startles him awake.  Don't let it get too loud, but a consistent volume (like a radio playing, or the TV on at a constant volume), that sounds low from his room, will get him used to sleeping with some noise.  Unless you live out in the sticks, you'll never be able to completely eliminate noise...better to get him used to sleeping in these conditions.</td>

<td>Are breastfed babies better bonded to their moms later in life than bottle fed ones?</td>
<td>I think that babies who are held are better bonded than babies who are not held regardless of feeding method.  So breastfed babies and babies who are bottle-nursed are going to be more bonded than babies who are left to hold the bottle themselves, or worse, propped up with a bottle on a pillow.  Breastfed babies have an edge in bonding just because of the hormones produced during breastfeeding, but I'd guess the act of cuddling and looking into the baby's eyes would have more effect.</td>

<td>Call me paranoid, but I am worried because my baby doesn't babble yet...?</td>
<td>I work in a daycare with 12 to 18 month olds. There is a huge range of speech ability amongst my students. Most of the children enter my class at around 12 months, and are not yet saying any words, not even mama or dada. Quite a few of them will babble random syllables, but some of them make little or no noises at all (except, of course, crying). A few of the children who were not speaking in my class did not start doing so until they were in the next grade up, the 18 to 24 month class.

I understand that, as a parent, you want the reassurance (as soon as possible) that your child is developing properly. But I wouldn't jump to any conclusions about your child at only 8 months. You mentioned autism, but there are several other common symptoms that you did not mention, such as a lack of eye contact, resisting physical touch, and an inability to "connect" with other people, among others. 

If your child has other symptoms that concern you, discussing it with a professional is best. Otherwise, try not to worry too much about it. Just make sure you talk around your child constantly and try to pick up on the words he does use. A child may use one word, even a nonsense word, to describe many things. For example, one boy in my class (19 months) points to everything and says "Diss?" It's one of the only words he says, but we figured out it means "What's that?" Listen for cue words like that from your son and make sure to respond to his babbles with lots of descriptive words. Odds are, one day he'll just start repeating back what you say to him. :)</td>

<td>How to get a baby to sleep alone?</td>
<td>Why it happens
Perhaps your baby's squirminess and noisy breathing are keeping you up all night or having him in your bed has put a damper on your sex life. Whatever the reason, helping your baby make the transition from the family bed to sleeping alone can be a challenge. And it's only natural that your baby should protest. After all, he's gotten used to snuggling up to you during the night. The transition may take anywhere from a few days to several months, depending on your baby's age and how long he's been sleeping with you. 

What you can do about it
Plan on wearing out the carpet between your baby's room and your bed for the first few nights while you go back and forth to reassure him. This change will be particularly hard for a 10- to 12-month-old, who may be experiencing separation anxiety anyway. To ease the move, you can try a number of different strategies. One first step is to get your baby used to sleeping in his crib or bed during naptime. You can also gradually make the transition by first sleeping with him in his own room. Expect some protests about this new sleeping spot, but rest assured that having you nearby will ease the transition. Finally, you can start with just bedtime, having him fall asleep on his own in his own room but bringing him into your bed when he awakens at night. After a couple of weeks, you can take the final step to having him sleep in his own room all night.

Give your baby plenty of comfort while he makes this transition, but once he's finally settled in his own room all night, don't bring him back to your bed. This will only confuse him and send the message that he'll be rewarded if he cries long and hard enough</td>

Vernix is composed of sebum (the oil of the skin) and cells that have sloughed off the fetus' skin.</td>

<td>I'm looking for breastfeeding advice?</td>
<td>I had the same problem! I was always calling the LC or nurse to my room to help me feed. I had a C-section, so they wanted me to use the football hold. My arms are short, so I never got the hang of it. I just used a pillow and cradle hold. When I left the hospital, both of my nipples were bleeding and sore. I pumped to give myself a break. Pumps are much kinder than baby!

Helpful things I read/heard:
Your nipple needs to touch the top of the roof of the baby's mouth. You can accomplish that by using your thumb on top in the C grip to point the nipple upwards slightly.
Put as much breast in the baby's mouth as possible.
If the bottom lip isn't "flanged", then gently push down on baby's chin, so the lip pops out so you can see it.
In the early weeks, you kinda have to latch them quickly. I saw a video at the prenatal class that looked like the LC was shoving the baby into the mom's chest. It looked bad, but you really do have to do it fast and firm early on. Otherwise, they don't take in enough breast and in seconds you will be bleeding.
If your nipples are really sore and bleeding so that it's torture to breastfeed, then pump until one heals enough so that it's tolerable.
It only takes 10 sucks to make your nipples sore.
Use soothies before they get to the bleeding stage.
The LC suggested a steeped teabag on sore and bleeding nipples.
If your nipple is flat after feeding, baby isn't taking in enough breast.</td>

<td>I have a 2 month old daughter who weighed 6 pounds 9 oz. when she was born.  She sleeps the same amount at night as your son does.  And I am so thankful for that.  She weighs the exact same as your son also.  She was born Jan. 26, 2006.  Weighs in at 9lbs. 11oz.  At least that's what she weighed at her last check up on march 23.  She might weigh more now.  He is eating find.  My little girl is a chunk.  Sometimes boys don't get as chunky as girls do when there baby's.  My son is now 12 months old and wasn't as chunky as my daughter is.  If your son seems hungry, try feeding him.  Feed him when ever he is hungry.  
If your breast feeding, they say breast fed babies need to eat more often because they don't get as much milk at every feeding.  If your bottle feeding like I am, then just feed him when he wants to be fed.  If he gets fussy after you feed him, just try burping him.  He might just have a air bubble stuck in his tummy that doesn't feel good.  Doctor says that some babies do eat every 2 hours during the day and not as often at night.  I feel that describes my little one perfectly.  She eats any where from 2-4 hours during the day.  Your doing things just fine.  Your a good Mommy.

If you can, get something soft (foam pads, inflatable stuff) that he can bop his little head off of, he may find bouncing off something is more amusing than the thwack he is giving himself now.

If that doesn't help, try the old distraction method. Fun fast music and a dance around the room, bubbles, a fist full of Cheerios. 

I'd also call your pediatrician and see if he has any advice, and also to get it into his medical records, that way, should anything happen, these possible self-induced injuries are documented and you won't be charged with child abuse.</td>

They are totally dependent on those picking them up, until their neck muscles develop to hold their head up.</td>

First they crawl, then they do the furniture shuffle, then they walk.  Enjoy the moments.  Once the little one starts to walk, then you will be chasing them all around the house.</td>

<td>Thumb sucking.?</td>
<td>There is a medicine you can buy that helps stop thumb-sucking.  It is orange and you apply it with an iodine type dropper.  We used it a couple times on our daughter when she was about 4 or 5 and still sucking her thumb.  She ended up developing a tolerance for it and it didn't stop it.  We even went so far as to buy a small thumb guard and taped it to her thumb, but she figured out how to get it off.  Your little one is still a baby at 17 months.  Let her have her comfort.  If you've recently gone through a move, it is traumatic for kids, she may just need to suck her thumb for awhile until she gets used to things.  When our daughter was about 5, we started telling her that thumb-sucking was something she needed to do in her room.  She is 21 now, has fine teeth (didn't need braces) and is well adjusted.  She doesn't even remember how old she was when she stopped sucking her thumb completely, but she says she was pretty old!  Don't fret it so much, she'll be fine.</td>

<td>Why does my baby not sleep through the night?</td>
<td>Okay, first of all, babies under 11 lbs (some books say 13)are incapable of sleeping through the night, simply because their tiny tummies cannot hold enough to last that long, even if they fill them completely right before bed. I don't know how much your baby weighs, but that could be a factor.

Assuming that she is over 11 lbs, then you will have to train her to sleep through the night. There are many many many ways to do this. The upshot of them all is that the baby has to learn to soothe itself. Which will require her to cry at some point. That is the reason why my daughter still doesn't sleep through the night, because I cannot stand to hear her crying.

I would suggest that you do your research and pick a sleeping plan that works the best for you and your family. Once you decide on a course of action, consistancy is the key to making it work. Also, you are likely to get LESS SLEEP, while you are trying to get her to sleep through the night. And she will cry. And cry. And cry.

If I haven't scared you off yet, here is what I would suggest. Keep track of how she sleeps during the night for a week. What time she wakes up and how often she's awake for. You should be able to see a pattern. For example, she might be waking up at midnight and four am every night. The first thing you want to do is eliminate the midnight feeding. So when she wakes up at midnight, you go to her and comfort her. You rock her or pat her on the back, soothe her, talk to her, (some people suggest not picking the baby up because this will make her think you are going to feed her.) whatever you have to do EXCEPT feed her. Until 12:30 (In other words, half an hour after the usual feeding.) then go ahead and feed her and put her back in the crib to sleep like normal. Continue this pattern until she is finally waking up at 12:30, instead of 12:00. Give her a day or two to get used to that pattern (and yourself to get some "normal" sleep) and then start trying to push her back another half an hour. This whole process will take a long time, like several weeks to a month. And you will most likely encounter setbacks. Good luck.</td>

Is it just runny, or is it actually "watery", like a consistancy of water?  Because if it is just runny and thin, that is normal.  If it is actually like water, then maybe you should talk to your doctor again.

I visited a hand-full of daycares in my area before chosing Tutor Time and I still feel I made a good choice.  Trust your instincts when you go to a place to take a tour.  And don't worry about being protective and expressing your concerns when you talk to the teachers and the director, most of them have kids and are very understanding.

Some do it because they are just really sick and twisted in the head like the one who drugged them, and then drowned them. I think there are a lot of contributing factors, but the main is postpartum depression. 

There is also a disorder called Munchausen by Proxy in which a parent will make their child ill, sometimes forcing them to indure painful procedures in order to gain attention for themselves. I dont know what causes it I think it is just that mental illness goes so untreated in this country and is a dirty little secret that when there are serious warning signs they are ignored and the person becomes desperate.</td>

<td>How to change a diaper guide

Step 1


Place the baby on his/her back. This is safest position for the baby and easiest for you to change the diaper. 
Step 2


Take the baby's leg out of his/her clothing and slide the clothing above the waistline. 
Step 3


Gently open the diaper. Fold the tabs back so they don't get in your way or stick to the skin. 

Step 4


Use a cloth to cover the hose area so you don't get sprayed if they decided to go number 1. 

Step 5


Open the diaper. 

Step 6


You can use the upper half/front of the diaper to sweep the bowel movement from the front to the back. Use diaper wipes to clean the baby's skin. If the baby's skin becomes irritated, try using a soft washcloth instead of prepared baby products. Note, always wipe from front to back to reduce the risk of spreading infection. Do a good job cleaning, it can reduce diaper rash. It is advised not to use any products containing alcohol on your baby's skin for the first 12 weeks to limit the chance of skin irritation. 

Step 7


Dispose dirty diaper and used wipe. Make sure that it's disposed of in an area not accessible to the baby because you don't want to risk the diaper going into the baby's mouth. 
Step 8


Apply baby powder or petrol jelly to soothe and protect skin. Do not use baby powder, because inhalation of the powder is harmful to the baby and may lead to serious complications. 

Step 9


Take new diaper and place it underneath the baby's back. 
Step 10


Open the tabs 
Step 11


Fold the diaper, and then fold the tabs. Make sure that the diaper isn't too tight, because it can constrict the baby's tummy and make the baby spit up food. Make sure the diaper isn't too loose, because it may not serve its purpose. A good rule of thumb to test if the diaper is properly in place is to see if your pinky can fit comfortably between the diaper and the baby's skin. 

Step 12


Carefully place the baby back into his/her clothing.</td>

Find a new doctor and realize that normal babies NEED to eat all through the night.  That's why breastfeeding is the best choice, it makes the night feedings soooo much easier.

From the link below:
"An unfortunate practice in industrial societies is the feeding of cereal grains to infants. Babies produce only small amounts of amylase, needed for the digestion of grains, and are not fully equipped to handle cereals, especially wheat, before the age of one year. (Some experts prohibit all grains before the age of two.) Baby's small intestine mostly produces one enzyme for carbohydrates—lactase, for the digestion of lactose. (Raw milk also contains lactase.) Many doctors have warned that feeding cereal grains too early can lead to grain allergies later on."</td>

<td>Every child is different, but here's my experience with my two girls ... I'm a father of 3yr old twin girls. They showed a little interest in toilets when they were 18 months old, so we were thrilled that we might have them out of diapers early. Such was not the case. They preferred to use their diapers and we decided not to make a big deal about it. Quite a while later we started to talk about 'being big girls' and how that included 'big girl panties'. We just continued to have these kinds of conversations now and then until they decided that they wanted to be big girls. It was pretty much a quick adjustment. Every time they went to their potty we would just make a HUGE deal about it .. call each other over, hugs &amp; kisses &amp; clapping. That was the only 'rewards' we used. I think my wife and I must have been quite a sight hopping around the bathroom! It became a fun game for my girls and they would often try to race each other to see who could 'go on the potty' first. We kept them in diapers at night for another couple of months. They both had a couple accidents during the day and night, but not too many and not for too long. 

So, from my experience, Don't Worry too much about it. Don't do any of the negative stuff .. I don't see how it's really productive, and it seems just a bit on the mean side, to me. It never really made sense to me, Why make your children feel bad? or uncomfortable? or dirty? 

They _will_ learn .. just let them do it on their own time with lots of encouraging words and actions from you</td>

<td>5 week old throws up after feeding only when she lies down?</td>
<td>My son had the same problem, and yes its reflux.  The reason they said that it happens in babies do young is because the sphincter at the top of their stomach doesn't close all the way.  They will grow out of it when they start sitting up, and the sphincter sloses.  I was told to try and keep him sat up or reclined (not flat on his back) for about 15 - 20 minutes after a feed.  Good Luck...I know with time that it goes away.  I was also giving my son ranitidine to keep the acids down in his stomach (perscribed by the pediatrician)</td>

Then I him meat at the very last. After meat, I started buying gerber food that has combinations of ingredients like garden vegetables, or chicken and pears.  I also gave my son watered down juice.

<td>How do you wean a baby from nursing?</td>
<td>It is best to do this gradually so that you have less discomfort. Depending on how often your baby is nursing now, will dictate how long it'll take you to wean. Start replacing 1 feeding with a formula. A couple of days later, (or more if you want to be really gradual), replace another one with formula and so on. Your breast will feel full when you skip a feeding. If it's very uncomfortable, you'll have to express milk (but only enough to relieve discomfort) by hand or pump. If you are really engorged, you may try a hot bath and/or tylenol.

I weaned my son at 12 months when he was only nursing 2x a day. It only took me 2 days, but I felt full for about 2 more days.</td>

<td>What's the memory of a 6-month-old?</td>
<td>Recall memory — the ability to remember some details of a specific experience for a short amount of time — begins between 6 months and a year. Once your baby begins to have recall memory, he is much more determined about what he wants to do or have. The sorts of things that he will remember first are those that have some sort of importance for him and which have been repeated often. By this age your baby will be able to remember where his toys are and to imitate actions that he saw as much as a week earlier. At the same time he will also begin to show you he knows what's coming next at meal-times, bath-times, and bed-times. Knowing what's coming next is a way of showing you that he remembers what happened last time.</td>

there's no reason why babies couldn't swim. if you've never seen a little baby swim, you can't really suggest that they can't. it may be just that we're too over protective of our children, and think they can't swim, so we load them up with floaties and other stuff.  my 2nd daughter frightened the hell out of me one summer, she jumped in the pool to get me when daddy blinked, and she floated right up to the top. she wasn't gasping for air, or scared. i was more scared than she was. she thought it was the coolest thing ever.</td>

<td>Is it safe to switch a baby to cow's milk at 11 mos and 2 weeks?</td>
<td>Make the transition gradual for your child.  For example, if your baby currently drinks 8 oz of breast milk/formula per feeding, reduce that amount to 6 oz then add 2 oz of "whole" milk.  Do this for a few of days.  On the fourth(ish) day, reduce the breast milk/formula to 4 oz then add 4 oz of "whole" milk for a few more days, etc, etc.  At the end of two weeks, assuming your child was able to tolerate the cow's milk, he/she should be at a full bottle of cows milk.  Because babies this young still need fat in their diet, make sure you are giving your baby "whole" milk (NOT reduced fat). They need the extra fat until they are two.

Over a couple of days, go to just putting her into the swing while it is off and letting her sleep.  Then you can start putting her in the bed.  Start with a time of day that YOU are most functional.  I think mid morning is best for most moms.  It will take some time, but you should be able to break her of this habit.  Good luck.</td>

My sister who breastfed her son didn't feed him ANY food at all until he was one year old.  I think this is what her pediatrician recommended, as her son was kindof a sickly little baby for a while.

There are many over the counter teething prepaeations and many myths surrounding them.  The truth is that for infrequent use they are safe (but only effective for a short time.)

Tylenol is safe to use around the clock, as is Motrin/Advil/Ibuprofen (but only approved for babies over 6 months.)

Massaging the gums may also be effective.

<td>how to get a 3 month old to sleep at night?</td>

How night sleeps worked out for me. . . . . 
 
1st of all don't try putting your 3 month old to be at 8 or 9. She is definately going to wake up in the middle of the night.

Wait til you are about ready for be and give her a nice warm bath (Try that Johnson &amp; Johnson Bedtime Bath. It works like a charm). Then a warm bottle with about 2-3 tablespoons of baby cereal and some soothing baby music. 

I did this every night starting about a week after I brought my son home. He would sleep through the night unless he was having bad dreams or if he was sick. On those nights try a Teaspoon of Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Vapor Bath along with the Bedtime bath. Sick or not she will enjoy her night time sleep.

As she gets older but her to bed earlier and her sleep patterns will change a little during the night but her nights (and yours) will be peaceful. . . 

I tried many different things wi th my son because I was working, going to school full time and taking care of him alone so sometime you just have to try different things til you find something that fits you and the baby.</td>

2-5% caused by Mosaic Trisomy 21... NOT INHERITED

2-5% caused by Translocation Trisomy 21 where the extra chromosome is translocated to another chromosome APPROX 1/3 OF THESE CASES ARE INHERETED meaning it is more likely to have other children with this form of Downs Syndrome

<td>That is wonderful news! Babies (and children) dont need any kind of juice. There is nothing beneficial in juice. It's basically just sugar and that's bad.

A six month old shouldnt need to be drinking water. You want your son to get all of his liquid intake from formula or breast milk.

Once your son starts drinking from a sippy cup you can offer him formula or breast milk in the cup. Once he is weaned from formula (at one year old) you can give him milk in his cup at meal time and then give him water in his cup in between meals to keep him hydrated. 

But for now, and even later, if he doesnt want water (and he shouldnt be getting it yet) then he isnt thirsty. He will drink when he is.</td>

<td>what is the ideal age to stop breastfeeding?</td>
<td>I would encourage child-led weaning. You let the baby/toddler nurse until THEY are ready to give it up. Breastfeeding is not gross. That's what your breasts are actually meant to do, feed a child. They weren't put on your body to sexually satisfy some man's crazy fixation... that's just a bonus! Come on... you don't see bulls running up to a cow and giving her udders a squeeze. "HEY BABY WUZ UP" &lt;squeeze&gt; Do you think Mary whipped out a bottle of Similac, told Joseph it was his turn to heat it up and feed baby Jesus? Its what they are there for. Any way, I have bottle/formula fed (1st child) and exclusively breast fed for 2 yrs(2nd child) and did both for the third. They are all healthy, emotionally secure and intelligent. I don't think there is any harm in extended breastfeeding. People asked me all the time when I was gonna stop nursing and I always politely replied when HE's ready. When a child is older and still nursing, they only nurse 2-3 times a day. A big misconception is that a mother is toting around a 30lb 3 yr old constantly on her boob "feeding". Its not like that at all. Toddlers will nurse to go to sleep or maybe when they wake up in the middle of the night, or during the day to settle for nap. Its more of a comfort thing than a nutritional thing at that age, but still healthier than koolaid. Remember Breast milk encourages braincell growth... more  braincells ...smarter people... today's society will only benefit.</td>

<td>New Baby and a 2 Year Old.....?</td>
<td>Firstly it sounds as if he wants to love his sister.  I am not sure why you thought it a good idea to keep him away from you but it is done now.  The risk is that this could have caused him to resent his sister, but it seems he does not.  My boy also had to be kept away, for medical reasons.  He didn't see mum for a week.  The extra attention she gave him must have helped negate this.

Some kids want to harm a new arrival, I don't think yours does, he just wants to explore her, she is like a toy to him.  If you have a pet he should understand the difference quite quickly.  You need to make him feel that he is as important to you as she is and if you can, as important to him as you are to him.  Getting him to help change her nappy is an excellent idea.  My little boy is now three and his sister is just one.  This morning for example, he told me loved Lola (his sister) and gave her a hug and a kiss.  It is not always this good but to get there you need to treat her as an important part of his life.

Never punish him if he hurts her.  Occasionally he may knowingly hurt her and you must try to explain to him not to.  He will understand but it will not necessarily stop him doing it again.  Don't leave them together if you can help it but now and then pretend to, and stay just out of sight.  He will want to explore her, so let him, but obviously be careful because he doesn't understand what is OK and what is not.

The very fact that he screamed "my baby" at his Dad and not "my Daddy" at his sister is fantastic.  You really should not have any problems at all as long as you always include him.  Occasionally she will also hurt him by scratching or pulling.  Make sure you are there so he can't retaliate and reassure him that it was an accident.  Explain that she didn't mean it and doesn't understand.  The problems I have had with mine are too few to even register on my memory.

Each night he kisses her goodnight and her him.  If I pretend that I am going out with him and leaving her behind, he will get upset and tell me that I can't leave Lola.  Sure it's not perfect.  He often tells me he doesn't like her.  This is usually when she is in his space, like for example he is colouring in with crayons and she comes and takes one or rips the page.  Make sure that if he needs some space from her he gets it.  

Never scold him if he lashes out, if he gets punished he will learn to resent her.  Simply separate them and give him a warm loving explanation of why he mustn't do it, she will wait.  If he hurts her, then see to her.  He will be worried and that is enough for him.  When you are sure she is OK then reassure him because he will be concerned too, then explain No! lovingly.

The more love you give them the more they will show each other and you, and there is nothing more rewarding than your children telling you they love you.</td>

<td>Newborn keeps spitting after meals. Why?</td>
<td>When your baby takes in air along with his breast milk or formula, the air gets trapped between the liquid — when the air comes up, so does the liquid. Also, because babies like to eat, and because they take in a lot of nourishment in relation to their overall size, they sometimes become overfilled and, well, overflow. A newborn's stomach muscles aren't fully developed, either — so the muscles at the bottom of your baby's esophagus (which control whether food is coming or going) may still be getting up to speed.
Try this to help your baby out:

• Hold your baby in a fairly upright position when you feed him. Feeding him while he's slouched (curled up in your arms, or in a car seat, for example) doesn't give the formula or breast milk a straight path to his tummy.

• Keep things calm when you feed your baby. Minimize noise and other distractions, and try not to let him get too frantically hungry before you start feeding him. If he's distracted or upset, he's more likely to swallow air along with his breast milk or formula. 

• If your baby's bottle fed, make sure the hole in the nipple isn't too small — which will frustrate your baby and make him gulp. On the other hand, make sure it isn't too large, or he'll be gagging and gulping because the formula or expressed breast milk will come at him too quickly. 

• Burp your baby after each feeding. In fact, if your baby takes a natural pause during a feeding, take the opportunity to burp him then, too, before giving him more food. That way, if there is any air, it'll come up before even more food is layered on top of it. Don't forget to put a soft cloth on your shoulder first! (By the way, if you don't get a burp up in a few minutes, don't worry. Your baby probably doesn't need to burp right now.) 

• Keep the pressure off his tummy. Make sure your baby's pant waist or diaper isn't too tight, and don't put his tummy over your shoulder when you burp him. Try to avoid a car trip right after a feeding, because sitting in the car seat (in a slouched position) can put pressure on your baby's stomach, too. 

• After he eats, don't jostle your baby around too much, and try to keep him in an upright position for half an hour or so. This way he'll have gravity on his side. You can carry him, put him in a pack, or prop him against some pillows next to you, if he's big enough. 

• Don't overfeed him. If your baby seems to spit up quite a bit after every feeding, he may just be overfilled. You might try to give him just a bit less formula or breastfeed him for just a little less time, and see if he's satisfied. (He may be willing to take less formula or breast milk at a time, but more frequently.) 

• If your baby tends to spit up while sleeping, elevate his head. It's unsafe for your baby to sleep with a pillow, but you can place a foam wedge under his mattress or put the head of his crib safely on blocks. 

Most babies stop spitting up by around 6 months of age, or once they learn to sit up, but a few will continue until their first birthdays.</td>

<td>Why does a baby of 2weeks old keep hick ups everytime after I feed him?</td>
<td>Hiccups are named for the characteristic "hic" sound that occurs when the diaphragm muscle under the lungs tightens (contracts) suddenly and repeatedly, causing a person to take quick, short breaths. Hiccups are common in babies, especially in those who hiccupped before they were born, while in the womb (uterus). The exact cause is not known, but they are thought to be a normal reflex, probably due to immaturity of the nervous system. Hiccups in fetuses (babies still in the womb) may help to strengthen the diaphragm muscle and prepare the fetus for breathing.

During the first few months, hiccups often occur after meals. Hiccups usually go away within a few minutes and cause no discomfort to the baby. If your baby's hiccups bother you, try burping your baby more frequently during feedings.</td>

<td>Can you answer this question about getting Circumcised?</td>
<td>Circumcision is a cosmetic surgical procedure.  The hope is that it will result in a penis that looks "properly circumcised."  However, as with any cosmetic surgery, the results are not 100%, you always run the risk of ending up giving your son a funny looking pecker.  That's what happened to you.

I'm assuming that you were told that this surgery might not turn out right.  Even if they minimized the risks, you were still informed that this was surgery, right?  You took a risk and your son lost.  That sucks, for both of you.

It's hard to tell exactly what the problem is.  It could be a "skin bridge" that encircles the entire shaft.  There are photos at this site that might help you determine just how serious the damage is and how likely it is that it can be repaired.
http://www.circumstitions.com/Botched1.html

Now, you need to decide if you want to go back to the table and risk another go at surgery or decide that you made a mistake and keep all surgeons away from your children's healthy tissue in the future.

Personally, I'd wait and see what puberty brings.  Then I could make an informed decision *WITH* my son instead of *FOR* my son.  Of course, that's just my opinion and I'm no doctor...

I wish you both luck!!</td>

<td>what is the relation between new born's skull and brain development?</td>
<td>The gaps in a babies skull has nothing to do with brain development. The gaps in a babies head are there so that the skull is very flexible during the birth process - thats why many babies' heads are deformed when they first come into the world. The flexible skull prevents injury to a baby's head and also brain.

As for brain development, a baby's brain develops very quickly from day one all the way up to about 25 years of age. The part of the brain that develops fully the quickest controls the sexual drive and the part of the brain that develops fully last is the part that controls logical thought/decision making.... isnt that kind of scary??? but interesting....

Babies are quite good at taking what they need, if the weather is warm offer your baby a little between feeds.
Giving a baby water actually sometimes can help settle a niggly baby, if your baby is still waking in the night it helps to cut out that night feed, and, gets them used to the taste of water - so you wont have a juice addict later on.</td>

Moral of the story, the kids are separate individuals who have interests and talents of their own.  Rather than push them towards what you had enjoyed, perhaps it would be better for them to be encouraged along lines that are natural to them as persons in their own right.

And it can be a troublesome thing to make a fuss over what is after all a superficial quality that the kids had no hand in creating.  So give it some thought before you get involved in this.

<td>how to make homemade chemical free baby wipes?</td>
<td>For home use, you don't need to make anything.  Buy a dozen or so of the *flat* cloth diapers (not the "prefolds"--the huge ones made of very thin fabric).  Cut them in quarters (or smaller if you want), and keep them near the changing table and have a bowl of plain water.  You can just dip in the water and wipe.  They are small and won't take up much space in your laundry.  They're reusable so you aren't creating a lot of waste, either.  You could even use them when you go out if you have a way of bringing along some water safely (or will have access to water where you will be changing baby).

Then, all you need is a well-sealed container that you can put the used wipes into.  And nothing is softer on a baby's skin that 100% cotton!

If you are looking for a recipe for wipes that are similar to the ones you buy, you can take a roll of paper towels and cut it in half through the middle to make 2 half-rolls.  Then, you take out the tubes from the middle and place one roll into an empty wipe container (wash it well if you are trying to avoid the chemicals used in the original product).  Add water and a gentle soap.  Pull the towels out from the *middle* of the roll, not the outside.</td>

<td>is it possible to breast feed with inverted nipples?</td>
<td>Yes.  A baby actually nurses on the breast, not the nipple.  The nipple is the "bull's eye" that helps baby get onto the breast.  As long as you have a baby with a good sucking instinct, it can work.

However, giving *any* artificial nipples (bottles or pacifiers) can interfere with this and make baby expect a nipple.  If you have inverted nipples, it would be *much* easier if you make absolutely sure that your baby isn't given an artificial nipple until she/he is nursing well (around 2 months old) by anyone.

Another consideration is that many mothers who had inverted nipples during pregnancy find that they pop out shortly before or after the birth.  You can also help this in several ways, but some experts recommend not bothering before baby is born.  This is especially true until you are at least 38 weeks pregnant, as nipple stimulation can make early labor more likely.

Lastly, are you *sure* you have inverted nipples?  Nipples are only inverted if compressing the breast about 1" from the nipple on both sides (i.e. place your thumb and one finger across from each other and pinch together gently) causes the nipple to move inwards towards the chest wall instead of outward.</td>

<td>is breastfeeding in public ok if a woman doesnt use a towel to cover up?</td>
<td>It blows my mind that this is still even controversial!
In New Zealand this has become a human rights issue, but not concerning the right of the woman to feed, but rather the right of the baby to be fed! 
You can feed discretely if you want. A tshirt that you hook up exposing minimal breast is easy enough to deal with. But really, if anyone is worried about seeing a woman feeding her baby then they have a problem, not you.
As for the person who said children might ask questions...Isn't that a good thing? Also, mums of young babies have to be careful they do not isolate themselves, which can lead to depression and lonliness. If you constantly feel you must be somewhere private to feed you may miss out on really valuable social time.

<td>If a caucasion woman &amp; a chinese man conceive a child, which race is predominate, white or chinese?</td>
<td>Well, I have many mixed friends and I can tell you, as research has recently shown, mixed people are often highly attractive due to the diversity of the gene pool... I hate to relate it to this but its also the same reason mixed dog breeds often live longer.  There is just less of a chance that  harmful genes become active due to the wide gene pool.

Since asians typically have darker hair and skin than a typical white person, you can expect your baby to have darker hair, brown eyes, and a face that is basically a mix of you and your partner.  Devon Aoki (I think thats how you spell her name) is a famous model who is half asian and half caucasian.</td>

<td>my 10 month old son doesnt eat much, how do i improve this?</td>
<td>Occupational and physical therapy are always a good idea when development is not progressing as well as expected, although it is important to remember that babies who were premature will almost always develop their skills a little later than non-premies.  Especially if they are more than a month premature.

As for feeding, the most important thing to remember is that as long as the baby is growing well, the actual amount he eats is not important.  Every baby's metabolism is different, and therefore the amount they take in is also different.

If the baby is having trouble gaining appropriately, usually we will recommend strengthenning the formula to give more calories, but don't do this unless your doctor tells you how.  If solid food is the issue, then some type of feeding therapy is usually needed.  It may also be a phase that he is going through.  Some babies are sensitive to textures, so trying different textures may help also.</td>

<td>Can you tell who a baby belongs to by their blood type?</td>
<td>Thats a great question.  Only rarely can you absolutely rule out a father based on blood type, even if you know your own.  And you can never positively identify a father, only say that it is possible.

That's because a person carries 2 genes that determine blood type, and either one could be passed to the child.

For Example, lets say, you have type A, your husband has type B, and your boyfriend is AB.

The baby could be born with A, B, or AB and you would not be able to tell who the father was.  Type O would rule out the boyfriend in this example.

So it really depends.  You can always find out what everyone's blood types are and then ask a professional, but as in the example you may not be able to get an answer that way.</td>

<td>Stupid ppl...sorry, but it irks me to read 'let her cry'...your baby is scared and lonely and misses you...she is smart - knows when she cries mommy will come to her aide - this is a good, natural response, not something to be annoyed about...go back in, rock her, sing, pat her belly or back...continue until asleep or calm...she'll slowly get better and you won't need her to hurt for it.

I run to my baby everytime she cries and now (5 months) she is a really happy and well-mannered baby (except when teething!)...she sleeps through the night and is very pleasent. 

Babies don't cry for no reason...she needs something...even if it is just the comfort of her mommy, you should give it to her. You cannot spoil a child with love and attention. Research has shown (even Ferber has admitted this) that letting a baby cry cause insecurity and many mental problems later on in life. Love you baby, she obviously loves you.

EDIT: The babies that usually grow up to be uncontrollable brats, as described above, are the ones who are left to "cry it out"...the babies that are treated like babies grow into happy people.</td>

<td>When I first bought clothes for my god-child, I bought them in yellow. 

(And they were way too big - my friend was really kind and said "Kids grow fast, she'll still use them!")

But I think pink and blue are for people like me who first  met a new parent with a new baby and the stupid exhausted parent doesn't give any clue what it is. So you are stood there saying dumb things like "It's lovely" - well, you can't say that! And then they say "Alex, or Jo, or Pat" and you still have not a clue whether to say "She's cute" or "He's cute". 

Some clever guy then started a factory to help out all of us who would like to say the right thing about an adorable new baby to a worn-out shell, who is a nice human being, and only wants another adult to let them know that their child is the best ever and totally worth it. And all we need is a little clue to make them feel good about their tough life. 

"Oh, well done on your new daughter". 
"Hey, you have a son!" 

Oh, why not! Anyone who buys blue for a new baby girl is asking to get into a debate and maybe would welcome a debate from someone who can talk. But maybe a stranger is happy to make small talk and avoid offence? I say, make it clear. 
"Have you met my new Daughter/Son, (Oga) yet?" is cool. 
"This is Oga" is just making difficulties for us all!

Dumb mime acts in the street are not telling us anything. And also, lots of people are colourblind, so it's still good to make it totally clear and introduce your baby!</td>

<td>My 9 month old won't sleep through the night?  Any suggestions?</td>
<td>I just went through a similar problem with my son. He is now almost 10 months. At 2 months he was sleeping through the night (bed time until 6 or 8 am) no problems, he even put himself to sleep! I just laid him in bed and he would play until he fell asleep. Around 5 months we had a few nights of getting up, but then he cut two teeth and started sleeping through again. At around 7 months he started to wake through the night. I tried many things like a soother, rocking him, letting him cry...the only thing that got him back to sleep was to breastfeed. Then it got worse and worse, about 3 or 4 weeks ago he was up EVERY HOUR! He would cry for hours if we let him, he just wanted me to hold him and feed him. Now we have done a few things and it seems to be working, the past couple nights he has slept RIGHT through and for the past couple weeks he was sleeping until like 4am feeding 10 mins and going back to bed until 7am. Here is what we have done...
During the day he has 2 naps, one in the morning, one in the afternoon. NO sleeping past supper time which is about 5pm.
Between supper and bed he has snacks and milk. About one and a half hours before bed we have an energetic fun play time with lots of excitment at the begining and wined down at the end. An hour before bed we have a bath, a story (with just a night light on) and breastmilk and baby cerial. Then I hold him in a laying down position as I walk to the cribe, I tuck him in, wind his music box, sing with it for a minute and then leave him to rest and fall asleep on his own! The one thing I didn't mention was that we also bought a homeopathic teething gel which I rub on his gums just before I lay him in bed. This gel has camomilla in it. It has no taste and does not freeze his mouth or throte. I tried it myself first. It is all natural so it won't harm him, but it soothes him and helps him sleep better. After we got it he got up every hour the first night, every few hours the second, and by the end of the week he was sleeping until 4am, this wekk all night!

I myself, breastfed my daughter until she was 17 months, and am currently on my 7th month with my son.  I dont plan on stopping breastfeeding anytime soon, unless physically I am unable to do it anymore.  I am hoping to be able to feed at least up until the 1 year mark.  The longer breastfed, the better the mental and physical wellbeing of your child, or so they say.

My friend had her second baby in June of 2005 and her first baby in June 2001.  She breastfed her first up until she found out she was pregnant.</td>

<td>Before the invention of plastic which is what most disposable diapers are made from, mothers diapered their babies with absorbant cloth or in some cultures, soft moss or lichens. Archaeologists have not found the remains of any ancient baby diapers and there's not a lot of mention of them in ancient writings. The remains of dirty diapers would be hard to recover anyway because the diaper and its - ahem - contents are not the sort of thing that's kept around the house for very long. Diapers would have been buried in pits along with the rest of the family's doo-doo and they would have rotted away pretty thoroughly before an archaeologist's trowel could find it. 
 
The first disposable diapers appeared on the market in the early 1960s. They were sold in pharmacies and grocery stores, but mostly as a novelty item. At the time, they consisted of a band of absorbent tissue that could be flushed down the toilet and reusable plastic panties. While this product was revolutionary, it was only used on special occasions like long outings or trips.

Since then, their design and absorbent qualities have considerably improved, offering babies much more comfort, and making the job easier for parents. Tape closures were introduced, wood pulp was replaced by a more absorbent gelling material, and elastic leg guards were added to eliminate annoying leaks.

Before the invention of disposable diapers, people used folded squares of absorbant cotton cloth. Some people use cloth diapers today as an alternative to wasteful disposable diapers.

In cultures where cloth was expensive or unavailable, rags were used and babies were potty trained a whole lot earlier! Infants in early American cultures were kept clean and dry with soft mosses collected in forests. The ancient Greeks seated their babies in ceramic potties. 

The convenient disposable is a relatively new (and environmentally hazardous) invention--created by a harried New York housewife named Marion Donovan in 1950. Mrs. Donovan, tired of washing, bleaching and air drying cloth diapers, cut up her shower curtain into plastic envelopes into which she slipped absorbent material. She used snap closures, rather than pins, to secure the new diaper on her children and dubbed her new product the "Boater."</td>

<td>Do you believe that music influences the baby's mind?</td>
<td>Music is a powerful way to connect with your child during the early years and can set the stage for close relationships throughout life. Babies and young children naturally respond to rhythm and melody--whether they snuggle close to you or sing and move to the beat. Throughout the world, when parents speak to their little ones, they adjust their voices to a more sing-song pattern. This pattern is one that babies are tuned in to and love to hear. Music also provides a wonderful way to connect your child to your family history and culture. An African spiritual, Irish lullaby, or Mexican folk song can all tell a story about heritage while providing a time of fun and enjoyment.</td>

It is often tiresome,you must always stay on your toes.  You must be sure everything is safe for them, so things don't topple over on them, or that they fall down the stairs, you must know at all times where they are, to keep them from unspeakable people as well as harmful liquids, plants, items and so forth.

You must give lots of hugs, and kisses, lots of praise and structure every moment you are there.  You must help them explore the world of crayons and art, paint and little creatures of the earth, like ants!!

Taking care of children is full time, it is daily, hourly , minute by minute, there is no vacation, not ever, even if you manage to get away a few days, your heart and concern is always with them.  
They are tyrants, little monster people, but they are also the most wonderful gift a person is given.  Something surely to cherish.  But it is eternal, you can never say, "Oh I changed my mind and don't like doing this."  Once their there, its forever..................</td>

<td>Any newborns hair will fall out and it doesn't matter what race or even gender. It is caused by the infant not being able to hold up its head when sleeping. Don't worry-it grows back! My two girls went through it and now they both have a FULL head of hair. 

One thing that I did do was after their bath (at night), I would put a little lotion mixed with 1 drop of baby oil in the palm of my hand and rubbed it together and gently massaged the head. If you still have the cap from the hospital, you can put it on after wards. It also helped warm the infant and helped against cradle cap. Plus, brushing everyday helps prevent tangles.

P.S. During play time, allow infant some tummy time on a blankie (under supervision). This keeps them from losing hair so much in the back.</td>

<td>how do u feel about immunizations and the link 2 autism?my son is 2 months.?</td>
<td>There is no proof that autism is linked to vaccinations.

This idea first came to light with one small study (wakefield et al.) which has been highly criticised for methodological limitations. Since this initial study, lots and lots of studies have disproved the link between autism and childhood vaccination, but have gone largely unnoticed by the autism community.

Here is an example of a recent study:
1292 cases of autism and PDDs were identified (76.6% with autism and 23.4% other PDDs; average age of diagnosis 5.4 years). 78.1% (1010/1292) of individuals with PDDs had been vaccinated with MMR compared with 82.1% (3671/4469) of controls. No association was found between the MMR vaccine and: all PDDs (OR 0.86 [95% CI 0.68 to 1.09]); autism only (OR 0.88 [95% CI 0.67 to 1.15]); or other PDDs only (OR 0.75 [95% 0.46 to 1.23]). No association was found when analysis was limited to children vaccinated before the age of 3 or to those who were diagnosed before media coverage of a proposed MMR link with autism (before 3 years: OR 0.90 [95% CI 0.70 to 1.15]; before coverage: OR 0.91 [95% CI 0.62 to 1.33]). ORs were adjusted for age at which person joined the General Practice Research Database.

Authors’ conclusions:

The MMR vaccine is not associated with autism or other pervasive development disorders.
(Evidence-Based Healthcare and Public health
Volume 9, Issue 2 , April 2005, Pages 145-146)

If you want any others, go to sciencedirect.com or www.pubmed.org and search autism and vaccines. It seems that you are putting you child (and others around them) much more at risk by not vaccinating them than by vaccinating them.

Saying that, however, there is some evidence that some children are genetically vulnerable to autism (such as those who develop normally and then suddenly regress into autism): any trauma may 'break the camel's back'- if not vaccination, then a new sibling, moving house, losing a favourite toy, etc. It is more or less inevitible.

Studies have shown that parents with autistic children who regressed are much more likely to attempt to explain the onset with an environmental cause because they feel 'guilty' that their child is autistic, and this is largely the reason this unsubstantiated link has stayed in circulation: as a scapegoat. No differences have been found between children who regress and those who showed autistic behaviour from birth (Davidovich, 2000), and there is an equal percentage of relitives being 'slightly autistic' in regressive and non-regressive cases, suggesting a common genetic predisposition.

Additionally, reports of 'regression' due to vaccination are highly based on parental observations, who may or may not be reliable in knowing developmental progress before the vaccination- in other words, many of these children who are reported to have regressed, upon review of home videos, had slight autistic tendencied before the vaccination.

What I'm saying- please vaccinate your child! You are risking their life and others who he comes into contact with by not vaccinating!

Please note- you can find more information on any of the studies I have mentioned using the below notes. I am speaking from a purely scientific perspective and have no experience having an autistic child, but I urge parents to look at scientific evidence rather than anecdotal evidence when deciding whether to vaccinate their child.</td>

<td>What toys will work my 7 month old kid smart?</td>
<td>Nhoy, my career encompassed 27 years selling toys to retails stores. In addition, I raised a son and a daughter.

When I was young, available toys, compared to today's, were simple and unsophisticated. Also, rather uncomplicated. We, myself and brother Philip, had wonderful times with such objects as shoe boxes, spatulas and other rather simple household items. Think, if you will, how our imaginations thought of the shoe box as a castle or a gasoline station or a school house. Think, if you will, how the spatula imitated a cowboy's pistol. Modern toys, although intricate and seemingly interesting leave little to the imagination. The first 2 years of a child's life, the "formative years", present immense opportunities for parental influence in areas involving the development and stimulation of the child's mind. Leave your 7 month old to discover his or her imagination with simple items. They may be candy dishes, spoons or napkin rings by your definition and preference, but to a 7 month old that , which sparks their imagination will adopt the "toy" title. Babies find incredible interest in natural items within their environment. They are curious and inquisitive. Spending large amounts of money on elaborate "toys" is unnecessary, at best. Reading to your child, although you may feel that at 7 months the child is incapable of understanding, is most beneficial both as an example of reading and as mental stimulation. Children learn, in their formative years, through imitating those within their environment. Reading to your child may, very well, encourage that "first word" sooner than later. It will also, hopefully, set a presendent for reading that your 7 month-old may wish to inherit later as he or she gets older. In addition to reading, talk to your 7 month old and talk a great deal to him or her. Conversation directed to your child not only stimulates it's mind, it also shows ongoing attention and illustrates love and importance. Your 7 month old may not presently understand the spoken word, but definitely understands the mental stimulation and graciously understands his or her importance within your family unit.

The purchase of toys for children is okay, within limits and for the right reasons. For gifts and occassions, certainly toys may be appropriate. However, many parents purchase toys to selfishly offer their children distractions so they may have uninterrupted time. Factually, a child's interest in new toys is short. Soon you have a large box filled with toys of which your child has no further interest. Second-hand stores thrive on such things. 

The best and most mentally stimulating toys from which a child may benefit are his parents. Hopefully, you or your and you spouse, if appropriate, are parents who have investigated and developed a proper agenda for contributing to their children's intelligence, or "smarts" as is used in your question.

I hope I have been helpful.

<td>can you spoil a 2 month old baby?</td>
<td>You probably won't spoil the baby, however you will get yourself into a bad habit and it will be hard to break as your child gets older. A baby that age needs to be reassured that you're there, however, you can go to the baby, talk and rub his back instead of picking him up to soothe him. Also, as the baby gets older, let him cry a little so that he learns to soothe himself. This is important for children to learn so that they can become more independent, even at a very young age. There have been studies that have shown that babies who are allowed to develop self-soothing techniques have less separation anxiety than those who don't.

So, in short, you won't spoil him now, but you could get into a habit that will be bad in the future.</td>

At about 7 months I started putting his food in front of him in his high chair and fed himself. Yeah he makes a mess, but it's adorable. Back to yogurt and meats, i started feeding him that stuff as soon as he started eating it. If they won't eat it, they're not ready. If it gives them a tummy ache after the first time then you know to wait a little longer. I've always based it on if he likes it, it's time. If it's not time then he won't be happy or he won't eat it. I didn't force him at any age. I just put the food in front of him and let him go at it. Once again, be ready for a mess! My son is 10 months old and still doesn't have teeth so I have to be careful because of that, but besides that it's all good.</td>

<td>My baby had Meconium aspiration syndrome when it was born. Is there anyway to avoid this in new born babies?</td>
<td>No.  MAS (mecomium aspiration syndrome) can happen before, during, or after labor and delivery when a newborn inhales a mixture of meconium and amniotic fluid. Often meconium is released during the birth process.  If released in utero, it is because something happened to put the baby in distress. In that instance, there are usually signs of fetal distress and the baby is delivered immediately via c-section if the heartbeat drops below 100 beats per minute. If the heartbeat stays stable, observation is the course of action.  However, the meconium has already been aspirated.

There is no way to predict that MAS is going to occur so there isn't a way to prevent it.  And a c-section won't prevent it if the baby just happens to pass meconium during the birth process.</td>

<td>I'm nursing so what can I take to help with the symptoms of a cold? What about Airborne?</td>
<td>Most medications, in fact, are compatable with breastfeeding.  A lactation consultant or La Leche League Leader has resources that can help you determine if a drug is safe to use while breastfeeding (your doctor might not).  However, some decongestants, especially Sudafed, can reduce your milk supply and simply aren't worth the risk.  For a cold, the best things you can do while nursing are the best things you'd do if you weren't - rest more than usual (whenever your baby rests and nurse laying down whenever possible), drink lots and lots of fluids, saline nasal sprays to help congestion, and let it run its course.  The websites listed in sources have other ideas and information on the compatability of medications.   Airborne is mostly vitamins and amino acids (fine while breastfeeding) with a few herbs (probably safe while breastfeeding).</td>

<td>Teething can begin as early as 3 months and continue until a child's third birthday.

Typically between the ages of 4 and 7 months, you will notice your child's first tooth pushing through the gum line. The first teeth to appear are usually the two bottom front teeth, also known as the central incisors. These are usually followed 4 to 8 weeks later by the four front upper teeth (central and lateral incisors). About 1 month later, the lower lateral incisors (the two teeth flanking the bottom front teeth) will appear. Next to break through the gum line are the first molars (the back teeth used for grinding food), then finally the eyeteeth (the pointy teeth in the upper jaw). Most children have all 20 of their primary teeth by their third birthday. (This is a general rule; if your child experiences significant delay, speak to your child's doctor.) 

Also, children follow typically a "statistical" pattern for developing all sorts of things, walking , talking , motor skills, cognitive skills.....but remember they are all individuals and you can't always say "my child is abnormal because he's not walking," because that child is simply not ready assuming there is no medical difficulties here.  So while parents get all concerned about the little Jones boy next door doing things their own child has yet to do, it shouldn't be of any concern.  
If your child appears advanced in specific areas, then utilize this to help him further develop in those areas.  Keep his interest up. You know what I mean?

<td>7 month old baby won't wean.  starting to lose weight.?</td>
<td>Breastfeeding a 7 month old is perfectly fine, APA reccomends for a minimum of a year if possible, longer if practical. The weight loss can have two factors, talk to your doctor about which one it could be. 

1. your baby is not ready to wean. Trying to wean early is causing frustration and undernutrition. Usually you should wait for cues from your baby that it is time to wean, like an interest in self feeding. Babies still need breastmilk or formula as their primary source of nutrition, bread, crackers, fruit, vegetables and cereal are all mostly filler at this early of an age. If your baby is not drinking formula to replace the breastmilk he/she is missing, that explains the weight loss. My suggestion would be to keep breastfeeding until baby is a little older, since that is what baby seems to want. Baby may be resisting other foods because baby can see that eating others will mean less nursing. Eating is still a bonding experience, and baby should still be fed breastmilk/formula by either nursing or being fed by you or another caregiver. My son eats baby cereals, fruits and veggies, but has no interest in drinking anything (including breastmilk) from a sippy cup or bottle unless he's absolutely starving, and I just don't like getting him to that point. So I understand how frustrating it can be when baby refuses to make it easy on you!

2. Around 6 months or so, babies start getting way more active. Crawling, moving, just being more active in general. This causes them to burn the calories that they have until now been storing away, so they stop gaining weight and even can lose a little bit. My son shot up to 20 lbs by 5 months, then fluxuated back and forth up to a pound at a time and is now 10 lbs and weighs 22 lbs, but has been up to 23. Do check with your doctor as to your baby's weight loss, they can tell you if it's healthy normal loss or if you need to go back to nursing until your baby is ready for something else.</td>

Just carry on feeding your baby on demand. And if you have one, put her in a sling and carry her about, the upright position will encourage her to go and you can get on with other stuff. 

All babies are different and assuming when she does go that the poo is normal then it maybe that she is not constipated, just that she does less poos than some other babies. 

If you are worried take her to the health visitor.

They are called baby showers because the party or celebration is for the BABY (baby neccessities) &amp; we SHOWER them with gifts &amp; love. ;o)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Planning a Baby Shower  (What to do…):

One of the first things you will need to plan for the baby shower idea is the location of it.
Are you going to have it at your house? 
Are you going to have it at a family members house?
Are you going to rent out a small reception room to have it in?

The next thing you will want to do is make sure that you have a list of everyone you want to invite to the baby shower.
A good rule of thumb is to mail out your invitations at least two weeks in advance. This is so that your guest will have time to plan to come to the baby shower.

Invitations For The Baby Shower
What type of invitations are you going to send to your guest to invite them to the baby shower?
Are you going to have a ladies only baby shower?
Is it going to be co ed baby shower?
Are you going to let the guest bring their children to the baby shower?

There are several types of BABY SHOWER cakes you can choose from.  You can go to your local grocery store or bakery and buy a pre-decorated baby shower cake with an edible picture (theme of shower) on it or plastic character decorations.  Or you can have someone bake the cake for you or do it yourself.

What type of food and drinks are you going to serve?
What type of games are you going to play?
Who will be the host/hostess at the baby shower?
What type of decorations are you going to have?
Get Help With Baby Shower

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

THE PARTY:

Decorate the room where the party will be held the night before (if possible) or early the morning of the party.  And have party favors on tables available for people to take home for a remembrance. 

Let everyone come in to sit &amp; mingle.  (If the mother-to-be will be mailing out thank you cards, it’s a good idea to have the guest fill out the thank you card envelopes with their name &amp; address for a prize.  You get them all &amp; have the mother-to-be to close her eyes &amp; pick one to be the winner.  (Hold the envelopes for mother-to-be to send out with her personalized thank you cards to the guests.)

When there is a good number of people or most that were invited, announce that you will start playing games.  You can start off by playing the written games such as Bingo, Word Search, Scrabble, Maze…etc.  (Be sure to take extra pens, pencils or crayons for people to use to play the games.)  Then play any of the other baby shower games that you like.  (Be sure to take prizes for winners!)

If you notice that people are getting hungry, you can announce that you will be taking a break to eat &amp; cut the cake.  Once people are getting done, if you still have more games and time, continue playing games.

Let everyone know that the mother-to-be will be opening presents.  (Have someone write down all the gifts given to her &amp; who gave them.  (Then the mother-to-be can use this list to personalize her thank you cards.)

When everything is done &amp; time is up, be sure to get people to help you clean-up!  Have fun!

FUN GAME IDEAS:

I liked the idea of baby dictionary, where you get some cards write or type baby words on them. Each guest gets to draw what the word is...until someone guesses the word. They hand their card to that person. The person that gets the most cards by guessing the right answers wins!

You can draw pictures or just write the word of a baby related item on pieces of paper. As a guest arrives, you pin that paper on their back. When there's enough people to play, then they can ask</td>

You can only catch a cold once, but there are thousands and thousands of strains.  As long as you don't see any inflammation (redness and swelling) and she doesn't run a prolonged or really high fever (or show signs of an ear infection), she'll be fine.  As long as she's playing and happy, don't worry about it.  It's gross but it's normal.</td>

You could be A or B because "o" is recessive and A and B are co-dominant alleles.  You could not be "o" because you would need two "o" alleles, but you could only get one from your Dad, and you couldn't be AB because your mom can only contribute one and your dad would have to give you an "o" because he has two of those.

<td>Any women here regret an abortion or have a story of abortion gone bad?</td>
<td>Regret:
I never considered abortion. When I was in my late teens, a very dear friend of mine, who was in her late 40s and married with 3 children at the time, confided in me. 
When she was 19, she lost her virginity and got pregnant. Before that, she hadn't even known where babies came from. Her family forced her to have an abortion. She didn't have a choice. Even though almost 20 years had passed since it happened, she cried when she told me about it. She said she always wished she had been brave enough to defy her family and have the baby. Seeing her pain, I could never even consider it.

Bad story:
My cousin needed to have one. Medically necessary. She didn't want it, but the doctor told her that if she didn't, her uterus would rip a few months into the pregnancy (bad emergency c-section w/ previous baby). Not only would she lose the baby, but she'd probably bleed to death, too. So she had to have it done. She had to walk past anti-abortionists calling her a murderer on the way into the clinic, and even though she'd asked them not to show her the ultrasound, the doctor put the chart with the pictures down in front of her anyway. She had it done, only to feel sick a couple of weeks later. She went to the doctor and he checked - there had been another embryo - twins - that the clinic didn't see. She had to go through it all over again.</td>

<td>My 1 year old doesn't like milk!! What do I give her?</td>
<td>My toddler doesn't seem to want to make the transition to cow's milk. Any tricks I can try?
Some toddlers greedily gulp whole cow's milk right off the bat. But because milk has a different texture, taste, and even temperature than breast milk or formula, some kids are hesitant to make the switch. If that's the case for your toddler, try mixing whole milk with some breast milk or formula at first (say, one part whole milk and three parts of his usual stuff). Then slowly shift the ratio until he's drinking 100 percent whole milk.

You might also try giving him just a little bit of whole milk at a time — a few tablespoons as a treat — until he asks for more. Or mix it with some cereal. And remember, just because your toddler is drinking his own milk from a cup now doesn't mean that you need to stop nursing him. Just make sure that breast milk isn't his primary source of nourishment. He's grown to where he needs more. 

How much milk should my toddler drink?
Your 1- to 2-year-old child should drink 16 to 24 ounces of whole milk a day. While you'll most likely have to work to make sure that he meets the requirement, keep in mind that it is possible for him to drink too much milk.

If your child drinks more than two to three glasses of milk during the day, he may not have room at dinner for the other foods that he needs to round out his diet. (He needs plenty of iron-rich foods like leafy green vegetables and meat, for example, because milk, unlike formula, does not contain iron.) So if your toddler's thirsty, get him in the habit of drinking water throughout the day, too. 

Can I give my toddler fat-free or reduced-fat milk?
Not yet. While we adults strive to eat and drink lower-fat versions of our favorite foods, it's important that you start your child out with whole milk, not lower-fat varieties.

That's because he needs the higher fat and caloric content for his growth and development right now. In fact, for children under 2 years old, fats should make up about half of the total caloric intake for the day. Once your child has another birthday — and he doesn't have any growth problems — you may decide to start switching to reduced-fat milk. 

What if he's made the transition but just doesn't like milk?
Meeting the minimum requirement of 16 oz. can be a challenge if your child doesn't care for milk. While chocolate milk does add sugar to your child's diet, it has the same amount of calcium and other important vitamins and minerals as plain milk. Better yet, try a powdered flavoring — just a small amount will provide less sugar than preflavored milks. Some varieties (like Ovaltine) contain added vitamins and minerals, too.

Keep in mind that there are many ways to sneak some milk into your child's diet. Serve him puddings, custards, and shakes for snacks. Make his soup with milk rather than water, and add a milk-based sauce or gravy to casseroles. 

What if he absolutely refuses? Or if we're vegans?
If your child won't let a drop of milk cross his lips or he can't tolerate it because of an allergy or your family is vegan, you'll want to be very conscientious about making sure he gets all the calories, protein, calcium, vitamin D, and other vitamins and minerals he needs. Your child's doctor or a nutritionist can help. So might these tips:

Some plant foods, like dark green leafy vegetables, broccoli, blackstrap molasses, and brussels sprouts, contain calcium. So do pinto beans, figs, tofu made with calcium, and calcium-fortified fruit juice. These foods don't provide all of the vitamins found in milk, though. They contain no vitamin D, for example, so if your child doesn't drink milk, you'll want to make sure that his multivitamin contains 100 percent of the vitamin D he needs. Also keep in mind that these are not easy substitutions — it takes 4 cups of broccoli to provide the same amount of ca</td>

Once your baby is 1, you can just use the sound monitor instead of the motion detector. The only thing you have to remember when using the motion detector, is to TURN OFF the unit before you pick your baby up or else the alarm will go off after about 20 seconds.  It is almost as loud as your home smoke detectors.   I highly recommend this!!!</td>

<td>Why do I see so many newborn babies heads not being supported anymore?</td>
<td>How true! The problem is babies having babies. Why, in this country, do you need to pass 2 tests to be able to drive a car, but you're not required to even take a class on caring for a baby when you're pregnant. Look at Britney Spears, driving her baby around, not in a car seat. This is the type of person young girls look up too? 

I can't tell you how many times I've actually phoned the local police when I've seen mothers (mostly young ones) run into a store leaving babies or very young children strapped into the back seat for 5 or 10 minutes. 

Most supermarkets have special seats for infants, and seat belts for toddlers, but a lot of mothers think it's OK just to put them in the front part. I actually saw a toddler, probably about 2, take a tumble head-first out of a shopping cart yesterday.


It borders on criminal neglect.</td>

<td>My baby is 13 months old and has a cold sore in her mouth. What is the best treatment for this.?</td>
<td>My niece had the same thing when she was a little over a year old.  My Sister called the doctor and they told her to go to the dentist.  The dentist told her that it was called "hand to mouth disease".  It is caused by children putting their hands into their mouth and their hands having bacteria on them.  He told my Sister not to give her acidic foods and drinks, keep her hands washed and to wait it out.  There wasn't really anything else to do about it.  It took a couple of days for it to go away.  Poor baby though.  There is an over the counter rinse called Peridex that you could swab on the sores.  It's used for gum and mouth sores in dental patients and patients with braces that get mouth ulcers from the braces.  DO NOT SWALLOW Peridex.  That's why I said to swab it on the babies sores.  It tastes like black licorice so hopefully the baby is o.k. with the flavor.  I worked for an Orthodontist so I know about the Peridex, but you should always check with your pediatrician or dentist before taking a strangers advice over the internet.</td>

If I couldn't tell by the smell, I would taste some of it. As a mommy, you get to be very familiar with how foods and drinks are supposed to smell and taste; you become a walking super-human food judge.

One way to avoid constipation is to give your baby some fruit juice to drink in small intervals during the day. Apple juice works great and if she still gets constipated, try prune (but very little amounts!).</td>

Depending on how you feel about letting your baby cry herself to sleep, that may only take a night or two.  This is actually what we landed  up doing and it only took her two nights to finally sleep through the night.  We would let her cry for 10 minutes at a time then go check on her.  We would NOT pick her up or talk to her, just rub her back, stroke her little face then walk out and close the door.  It was very hard to do but it worked!

<td>What is the specific job of a neonatalist?</td>
<td>These are physicians (M.D.s) who finish 4 years of medical school, do 3 years of pediatrics residency, and then spend possibly another 2 - 3 years doing a neonatal fellowship.  They specialize in caring for critically ill and premature neonates in a hospital setting.  They are called "neonatologists".  Any newborn in distress after birth (not breathing, hypoglycemic, poor color or tone), they step in and help with resuscitation.  This can be a premie or not a premie.  Once the baby is stabilized, they care for the infant in the intensive care unit (breathing machines, drugs to help keep the blood pressure up, nutrients delivered through the veins).  They typically don't spend much time with babies outside the hospital.  Occasionally they might have a premie follow-up clinic.</td>

<td>I had a baby 12 weeks ago, is it dangerous to still be bleeding?</td>
<td>You should not bleed for no more than 6 weeks especially if you had a vaginal birth.  C-section births are usually less due to the fact that the drs. clean you out real good after delivering the baby.  Most women after the initial 6 weeks will have their 1st period within a week though.  I have 2 kids, 1 delivered each way and my daughter just had her 1st baby by c-section 10 weeks ago and everything has been fine.  If you are still bleeding then you need to get to the dr. immediately.  I wouldn't hesitate a minute longer.  One of the biggest dangers to women is ourselves.  After the baby is born we focus on taking care of the baby and our family and put ourselves on the back burner because we either don't have time or feel everyone else needs to come first, we have to remember that if we don't take care of ourselves first we can't take care of anyone else at all.
Take care of yourself.  You have a new life there depending on you.  Good luck and I wish you the best.</td>

<td>how to stop breastfeeding?</td>
<td>Yes...We all know breast is best...but sometimes you just can't do it!!

SO, I would suggest taking one feeding a day and pumping a bottle of breast milk to get baby used to the idea of a bottle with something in it that baby likes.  If you are trying to feed the baby the bottle the baby knows they can get it from the source instead of from some bottle so they will not want the bottle. So have someone else give the bottle to the baby.  Plus, this way the baby will start to trust others to give them the "good stuff".  

It is also hard for baby to go from breast milk straight to formula because it is completely different.  One is very sweet and one isn't...One is very light and one isn't...etc

Once you get your baby to drink out of a bottle with breastmilk then try slowly mixing it with formula.  1/4 formula to 3/4 breastmilk.  About a week later 1/2 and 1/2 and so on.

I hope this helps!  =)  (Sorry if I was babbling)</td>

<td>how much and how often should a 3 month old eat, also how many times should you burp them during a feeding?</td>
<td>If he isn't satisfied, he probably needs more.  Its hard to put a number on how much a baby needs to eat, because every baby is different and has different metabolisms.

If you feed him more and he spits up, he's probably not spitting up that much (it always seems like more than it is) - you can tell by whether he's satisfied or not.  Regular checkups with the pediatrician will ensure he is gaining weight appropriately.

Spitting up and colic are common and he will out grow them eventually.  Its always better to have a spitty baby who is satisfied then one who is hungry all the time.

Burping during a feeding is not absolutely necessary, unless the gas tends to make his spitting worse. I usually tell people if the baby hasn't burped by 2-3 minutes, then quit and he will pass it on his own.

There are also other ways to manage reflux which are better options than restricting volume.  Talk to your doctor about thickenning feedings or using an added rice formula.  Also, dont feed the baby laying flat or lay him down flat after feedings.

Good Luck!</td>

<td>Do I have to be in the room when she gives birth?</td>
<td>Legally - no.  Morally - not really.  Emotionally - YES!!!
If this child is yours you will regret not being there to see the miracle of birth.  She may not forgive you if you are not there.  This is a very emotional time for a woman - we need the man there for support.  If anything goes wrong you need to be there for her.  And if all is well - which I hope and pray it will be - you need to be there to see it all with her.  The days my children were born are the greatest days of my life.  I did not have an easy delivery but I wouldn't change it for the world.
And keep in mind that she is in a GREAT deal of pain - excuse whatever she might do or say.  I bit my husband during the delivery of my son.</td>

<td>How can I get my 3 moth old to sleep all night?</td>
<td>Its frustrating at this age, but thankfully, there is nothing wrong with your baby - he is normal!

Under the age of 6 months most babies really do need to eat in the middle of the night.  Otherwise they could risk dangerous blood sugar drops, electrolyte abnormalities, or less than adequate weight gain.  It is not until 6 months that we even consider letting them "cry it out" to go back to sleep.

Some parents are blessed with babies that sleep through the night starting at a month or two.  Believe me - I wish I had been.

Cereal is not recommended until at least 4 months of life (some even say 6 months).  I can tell you that people try it at a younger age, and generally the babies either get constipated, excessively gassy, or if it works, it will only work for a few nights.

The only thing you can really do is try your hardest to make his awake time really fun and exciting during the day, and really boring at night.  When he wakes up at night, keep things as dark as possible (but still safe).  Minimize interaction with him and don't talk to him a lot at night.  During the day - DO NOT keep him awake all day, but make the awake time you do have with him as fun and exciting as possible.  And keep the lights on during the day.

This plays on 2 levels.  The dark/light differences play on our natural melatonin cycle, also known as circadian rhythms, and helps establish day and night for him.  Minimizing activity at night also teaches the baby that nighttime is for sleep, not for play.

As your baby approaches *6 months* if he is still not sleeping through the night, try the Ferber method:

<td>how do I get rid of gas in my newborn baby?</td>
<td>Newborns are normally gassy. If you are bottle feeding, your baby would be more gassy as if you are breastfeeding. If you are breastfeeding, make sure you burp your baby after each breast. If your baby is on formula, burp your baby every 1 or 2 oz of milk. 

Mylicon is also excellent. It is safe. My son's pediatrician recommended this. He said it is safe to use all the time and recommends giving it during feeding. You can give it before feeding time and before bed.</td>

<td>Don't worry about it.  He's just not ready yet.  I think the average age for children to start walking is 12 months.  So just that your son is starting to walk while holding onto something is a good sign.  

My dad said he did this with me:  Give the child something to hold onto horizontally, like a broomstick only much shorter.  The idea is to give the child the allusion that they are supported when they are not actually.  It is supposed to help them balance themselves, like a tight rope walker...</td>

<td>Can I take my 4-day year old baby boy out without him getting sick?</td>
<td>I had five children so I can easily tell you that taking a 4 or 5 day old baby out will not be a problem.  Newborn babies have their mothers antibodies and can fight off infection just as easily as you can.  I brought my third child out when she was about 4 days old in order to do my grocery shopping.  Imagine having a newborn, another daughter that was 11 1/2 months old and a son that was 2.  Like they say if you want to be extra careful keep everyone at least 3 feet away from the baby so the baby won't come in contact with anything.  If you go out and someone sneezes or you shake hands of put your hands on a shopping cart etc you are picking up and bringing the germs home anyway so don't be paranoid.  Enjoy some time out.  With newborns you need all the relazation you can get.  josephinedm@yahoo.com</td>

<td>Good luck. My son is 12 months old and won't sleep in his crib at all! I started to put him on the crib about 6 months and he hated it, but I kept trying. Then finally he would sleep there after hours of trying to stand up, me lying him back down. Then he slept there but a couple of hours later he'd wake up and want to be out of there. I could only handle a couple of nights of this because it was exhausting. So I gave up. Now we have peace and harmony back that he's sleeping with me and my husband. I will get him to his own room when the next baby comes, but in the meantime this is what works for us.

I know this doesn't answer your question, but I just wanted to let you know that if your baby sleeps part of the night in the crib, it's better than some of us can do.</td>

<td>When a man and woman have sexual intercouse, a man inserts his erect penis (located in his private area that is on his lower front part of his body) into a woman's vagina (located between her legs), the friction created from the woman's vagina snuggly around the man's penis causes the man to ejaculate, sort of squirts out a liquid called semen that contains millions and millions of tiny sperm into the woman's vagina.  The sperm "swim" up inside the woman's uterus into her fallopian tubes.  If there is an egg in the tube, the sperm fertilizes it and the egg becomes a zygote.  The zygote develops into a embryo, a fetus, then a baby within about 9 months.  The mother has very strong muscle squeezes that come and go inside her uterus that helps her push the baby through the birth canal and out her vagina.  It's very complex!!!</td>

From there you can spice up the decorating with the theme. Next is, what fascinates him? Animals? Clowns? My 1 year old was fascinated with jugglers and balls so my entertainment included jugglers and a puppet show with Elmo. 

1 year old likes colorful characters, stay away from older kids theme like for example superheroes if he is not familiar with that. Who are you throwing the party for, other kids or yours? Let him have a taste of his own cake and have fun. It's his party anyways. 

Overdoing a party can overstimulate him and make him tired. Try to keep it simple.</td>

I believe that diapers work to each his own, some babies do well with huggies some babies don't. It used to be $30 per box of 192 count last year of step 1, I think now it's $40. On average I only spend $40 of diapers per month.

Bulk is ALWAYS cheaper. After all, you're going to use them anyways later on. So I stack them up. Buy the most counts per box of diaper it is cheaper that way rather than by it by the pack.

I've always bought mine at amazon.com. They always have a promo of every 3-4 months of giving a $30 amazon certificate you can use later on for more diapers if you purchase $79 or more of pampers or huggies products that's why I end up getting my pampers cheap. Shipping is free. 

Amazon is cheaper than Walmart, Target or Kmart. Hope it helps.</td>

<td>Are you trying to increase your weight loss?  You actually need more calories while breastfeeding than you did while pregnant (500 extra a day for nursing vs. 300 for pregnancy).  Many women find they lose that baby weight relatively quickly and easily while eating to appetite.  Some women find that their bodies want to stay at a weight somewhat above their pre-pregnancy weight while breastfeeding.  If you want to lose more weight, Weight Watchers has a program specifically for nursing moms.  There's also a book entitled "Eat Well, Lose Weight While Breastfeeding".  Too rapid weight loss isn't really a good idea at this point - you need energy and nutritious foods to keep yourself healthy while taking care of a newborn.  Remember that it took 9 months to gain the weight, so it will take at least that long to lose it!</td>

However, giving a infant sugar is NOT a good idea. It is best to only give them formula or breast milk and maybe infant cereal in their milk if the doctor recommends it. As far as developing their taste buds it is best to give them baby food when the time is right to give them a chance to taste many nutritious foods before they become picky eaters and only get sugary foods.</td>

Studies show that breastmilk is best for babies because it has been shown to reduce the likelyhood of obesity in childhood as well as later in life aside from the benefits to the immune system.  Mothers produce only so much breastmilk a day.  With formula the baby can demand more than necessary.</td>

<td>MY son is mixed?</td>
<td>This is pigment.  It's most commonly found on the child's lower back and/or butt, and is known as a "Mongolian spot".  European/Mediterranean, Asiatic and Middle Eastern babies tend to have them more... it is a genetic trait to those with... as you may have guessed... some Mongolian ancestry (think about it, Genghis Khan conquered most of the civilised world).  Sometimes it is also accompanied by a "Mongolian crown", where there are two distinct raised parts on either side at the top of the baby's head.  My son has both these things.  Sometimes it fades to the point where you can't see it anymore... my niece still has hers and she is 7.  I still have evidence of mine, but it's just more of a darker pigment on my lower back/butt area now.

Babies can sometimes sit with support at that age.  And in general, sitting up unsupported (if someone places them in a seated position) generally occurs around 6-8months.  Getting herself to a seated position, though, generally does not occur until after a baby can crawl, which for her will be sometime in the next month or two, probably.

If someone places her in a seated position, though, she should be able to sit there and keep her balance at 9 months of age.  If she can't, then I would be concerned and discuss it with her doctor.</td>

We don't really know a lot about what signals the change, it probably depends a lot on acquiring the proper mix of all the helpful bacteria in our GI tract.  (When babies are born their guts are sterile - it takes several months to acquire the normal flora of bacteria.)</td>

So yeah, it'll only work for a minute but that minute might be all you need to distract him/her and get them to forget it themselves. Teething is a long, drooling, grueling process and it won't stop soon. Just have patience and if it gets really really bad, try something cold and squishy.

<td>Why do baby onesies (baby shirts) have criss-cross shoulders??? What is the purpose of that??</td>
<td>In order for a baby to pass through the birth canal the babies head must be larger than the rest of it's body including the width of the shoulders. This is to prevent the baby from getting stuck and it's just a natural occurance. The baby's body then plays a game of catch up over the next couple of years. The criss-cross shirts (as you described them) are to help get the baby's larger head into the outfit comfortably without having such a large neckline. It's not necessary, as some outfits use snap buttons on one of the shoulders or down the back for a wider opening for the head to pass through, but the criss-cross style is also more convenient than the buttons. :)</td>

<td>how can you tell if a baby is teething?</td>
<td>My son is 6 months old and doing the same thing. Teething can start anywhere from 3 months to 8 months, but every baby is different.

Your son cramming his fists into his mouth can be 2 things. He could either be teething or he is going through a  growth spurt. Babies typically go through growth spurts at these ages:
-3 weeks
-6 weeks
-9 weeks
-3 months
-6 months
-9 months

A growth spurt can last anywhere from 1 day to 1 week! Usually during a growth spurt, your baby will become more fussy, want to eat alot more, and sleep more.


Remember, just because you dont see any teeth, doesnt mean that your son isnt teething. Some babies have teeth come in, and then disappear again. This can happen for a few months.

Other signs that your baby is teething are:

-Drooling
-Face and/or chin rash
-Loss in appetite/ rufusing to nurse
-Sudden waking from naps when he didnt use to
-Sometimes, a baby might have a slight increase in temperature during teething
-Possibly diahrrea

If your baby is bottle feed, giving your baby his formula at room temperature or even straigh out of the fridge may help. The coolness feels good on their gums

A toy to chew on may also help. Once your baby gets his teeth, chewing on his hands may be dangerous because he can break the skins.</td>

Your forty weeks of pregnancy officially begin on the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP). So, your pregnancy actually starts before you've even conceived.Week two of your pregnancy actually begins at the end of your menstrual period,before the egg ripens and is released (ovulation) and before fertilization, when one lucky little sperm beats out another million or so in a wild and wooly race that begins a life.

About fourteen days before the beginning of your next menstrual period, POP! Ovulation occurs! The ovary releases the ripened egg, and the egg moves down into the fallopian tube to wait for her one true mate, a handsome hearty sperm.


During week four of your pregnancy (about five days after conception), implantation occurs. Once the embryo, now called a blastocyst, reaches the uterus, it searches for a nice place to implant. Then it burrows beneath the surface of the uterus and its cells begin to divide into two groups: those that form the placenta and those that form the baby.</td>

If he eat's alot he'll get sick. Talkk to your doctor and see if maybe you can give him 5 oz. Another thing you can do is start giving him cereal with his milk.

<td>Do babies get their top or bottom teeth first and how long does their first ones take to come in ?</td>
<td>Every child is individual as to when their teeth come in. In my experience, most get their two bottom teeth first and then they are closely followed by the two top. Both of my kids started teething at 4 months, but some may not have teeth even at one year! The average is about 6 months for most. Take a peak at  http://www.teething-teeth.com/TeethingandToothDevelopment.html 

Here is some interesting information from Dr. Sears:

When teeth first appear is as unexpected as the timing of baby's first steps, but in general, expect the first sharp nubbin around six months; some babies teethe earlier, some later. Heredity plays a part. If you check your own baby book, if grandmother was a tooth-record keeper, your baby's teething schedule may resemble yours. 

Actually, babies are born with a full set of twenty primary teeth. They are just buried in the gums, waiting in line for their time to sprout. Teeth push through in upper and lower pairs, usually the lower appear before their upper gum mates, and girls teethe slightly earlier than boys. The "rule of fours" is how teeth usually appear. Beginning around six months expect four new teeth every four months until complete, usually by two-and-a-half years. Teeth come through gums at unusual angles. Some come out straight, other first appear crooked but straighten as they twist their way through. Don't fret about spaces. It's easier to clean between spaced teeth, and the spacing of baby teeth does not necessarily reflect how the permanent teeth will appear.</td>

<td>Well for my wife, the first one was at home, in the bathroom after making love. With the second and fourth children, the Dr. broke it at the hospital. With the third child, we were sitting in a Denny's restaurant with the 2 older siblings, ages 2 and 4. We had just gotten our dinner meal and I was cutting up the food for my 4 year old. They were hungry from a day out shopping and couldn't understand why we had to leave before eating. They cried all the way to grandma's house, where we dropped them off, on the way to the hospital.

Embarrassing? Not really. We were too caught up in what was happening to be embarrassed... Calling the doctor, calming 2 crying toddlers, getting our meals packed up, trying to remember the fastest way to the hospital via grandma's house, all without trying to bring any more attention to ourselves.</td>

<td>How do you wean an 18 month little girl?</td>
<td>If it is at all possible, I would suggest continuing to nurse her.  Most children have an intense sucking need that continues for at least 2 years.  In addition, the longer you nurse her, the lower your risk *and* hers for breast cancer in the future.  You will also be protecting her from other types of cancer (including childhood leukemia), asthma, diabetes, allergies, etc., as well as minor ailments such as colds, ear infections, and stomach upsets.

The World Health Organization recommends nursing for *at least* 2 years.

Another thing to consider is that most toddlers don't always have a really good diet.  As long as she is nursing, you at least know that she is getting one really healthy thing in her diet every day.</td>

<td>what is the strangest food your baby likes to eat?</td>
<td>Well, I don't have a baby, but my parents always have fun telling me stories of my babyhood. Apparently, when I was several months old, I became obsessed with Sweet Potatoes (the ones that come in a can with that sweet juice on them). I was so obsessed with them that my mother couldn't afford to buy the cans anymore and had to make them herself. Within a few months of this obsession, I started turning orange (from all the carotene). The doctors told my parents not to let me have anymore sweet potatoes and they didn't. Since then, my obsession and love for those things has completely disappeared. Now, I can't even stand the taste, sight, or smell of them!!

P.S. At the time (or around the same time), I was also in love with apple juice and could drink my own weight of it. THAT hasn't changed at all!!</td>

<td>Babies see color from birth, but they have difficulty distinguishing similar tones, such as red and orange. 
As a result, they often prefer black and white or high-contrast colors. 
Between your baby's second and fourth months, color differences become clearer, and he'll start to distinguish similar shades. 
He'll probably begin to show a preference for bright primary colors now, too. 
Some great eye-catchers include primary-colored mobiles (hung out of his reach), bright posters, and visually striking board books.</td>

I see no reason to subject an infant to cosmetic surgery.  In my opinion, CONSENT is a vital component to such decisions and my babies could not consent to circumcision.

Anatomically, the foreskin is there for good reasons.  It protects the mucus membrane and allows easier and more enjoyable sexual relations for both males AND females.

Culture played into my decision not at all.  The number of circumcised males is dropping and, as my mama said, "If everybody else was jumping off a bridge, would you do it too?"

If your religion dictates that a blood sacrifice is required from innocent babies, it's time to think HARD about your religion...

<td>I found out I am pregnant, my baby will be 3mos next week, is it safe to have babies this close together?</td>
<td>Conceiving again before you've fully recovered from a recent pregnancy and delivery, (the average amount of time is 6 months), puts enouhg strain on your body without your adding the debilitating effects of worry. So, first of all, relax. Though conception in the first 3 months postpartum is rare, it ovbiously can haapen, and most have delivered normal, healthy, infants, little the worse for wear themselves.

Still, studies indicate that 2 to 2.5 years is the medically ideal space between pregnancies. So, its essential to be aware of the toll 2 closely spaced pregnancies can take, and to do everything possible to compensate, including:

-Getting the best prenatal care, starting as soon as you think you are pregnant. And you should be scrupulous about following the practitioner's orders and not missing appointments.

-Following a good diet. It's possible your body has not had a chance to rebuild its stores and you may still be at a nutritional disadvantage, particularly if you are nursing. You may need to overcompensate nutrionally to be sure both you and the baby you are carrying will not be deprived. Pay particular attention to protein ( have at least 75 grams or 3 servings daily), and iron ( you should probablly take a supplement).

-Adequate weight gain. Your new fetus doesn't care whether or not you've had time to shed the extra pounds from the previous pregnancy. The 2 of you need the same 25-35 pound weight gain during this pregnancy. So dont even think about losing weight, not even early on. A careful monitored gradual weight gain will be relatively easy to take off afterwards, particularly if it was gained on the highest-quality diet. Be certain, too, that you dont let lack of time or energy keep you from eating enough. Feeding and caring for hte child you already have shouldnt keep you from feeding and caring the child you are carrying. Watch your weight gain carefully, and if youre not progressing as you should, monitor your calorie intake more closely.

-Rest. You need more than may be humanly possible. Getting it will require not only your own determination, but help from others such as a spouse, friends, relatives- who should take over as much of the cooking, housework, and baby care as possible. Set priorities: let less important chores or work go undone, and force yourself to lie down when your baby is napping. If your not breastfeeding, finding a babysitter may help.

-Exercise. But just enough to keep you in shape and relax you, not enough to overtax you. If you cant seem to find the time for a regualr pregnancy exercise routine, build  physical activity into your day with your baby, like going for walks. 

-Eliminating or minimizing all other pregnancy risk factors, such as smokin, drinking, heavy lifting. Your body and the baby in your womb shouldn't be subjected to any additional stress.

<td>twins wont go to bed?</td>
<td>I'm a father of twin girls and had similar issues when they were about two.  They wanted to stay up later and later .. read another book, watch another show, whatever.  One of the two was definitely more defiant than the other.  We tried _exactly_ the same thing .. lying down with them until they fell asleep.  Then they began to expect that as their routine, if we left before they fell asleep it would be holy heck .. if they woke up shortly after we left the room, holy heck .. and so on.

What worked for us was,
1) I kicked the mom out of the room.  Of the two of us, she would continue to unknowingly encourage this behavior.  One more book, a drink of water, another hug, one more kiss, wipe my nose, pat my back, sit with me ... and on and on and on.  She thought that if she met ALL the needs (as mothers tend to do), then this would finally let the child go to sleep.  Such was not the case.

2) I established a firm routine, not like they were in the military. It could be a -bit- flexible, but not too much. It went something like this,

-One last show or book.  Prior to reading the book or watching the show, we would very clearly tell the girls that this was the last one and then we would get ready for bed.  At times we would even have them repeat us .."what are we doing after this show?" .. "going to bed"

-Pajamas on, brush teeth, and last potty.

-Into bed and one bedtime story.

-Kisses and hugs for Mommy. Tell her good night.  And she leaves the room .. AND .. doesn't come back, no matter what.  That's really important. The couple of times that my wife came back in during a 'difficult' night just made things worse.  The girls learned that if they cried loud enough or long enough .. or were cute enough .. that Mommy would come back in.  So they just delayed going to sleep some more.  So .. Mommy leaves the room and doesn't come back.

- Kisses and hugs for Daddy. 

- Heads on pillows and blankets up.

- Lights go off, and do NOT come back on.

- And this was the kicker for me .. at this point, there is no conversational intereaction.  Previously, if the girls started talking, we would answer their question or talk to them or otherwise engage in -converstation-.  This also delayed going to sleep.  Instead, I changed to no conversation.  If they started talking, or getting out of bed, or throwing a fit .. anything other than 'heads on pillows, blankets up, and going to sleep', I would simply state "because you are talking &lt;or whatever&gt;, I'm going to leave the room."  If they did not immediately get back to heads on pillows, blankets up .. then I would leave the room straight away.  They would cry a bit, of course, then I would come back in and state .. heads on pillows, blankets up. .. and start over.

There was definitely some resistance at first.  This was a new routine, and they tried every one of their old tricks to stay up later.  There were some nights where there was a LOT of crying.  But in a matter of maybe two weeks they were adjusted and doing very well.

That's my experience.  Yours may differ, of course.  I think, in general, the idea is 1) set a routine, 2) stick to it, and 3) remember who's the parent and who's the child.

Best Wishes!</td>

<td>Is it ok for my Pomeranian to be around my 3 month old son?</td>
<td>It's absolutely fine for the baby to be around the dog.  It's even a good thing.  The dog doesn't carry anything that the baby is going to "catch" and as long as he's sweet to the baby, and he probably will be, let them establish a relationship.  When I brought my first baby home, I was afraid the dog would be jealous because he had been our baby up to then.  But he became the baby's greatest protector and he slept under the crib from the first night we brought my son home.  Please don't lock your poor doggy out anymore.  Let him be a part of the family and then your whole family will be happy.  Including the baby and the dog...Plus if your baby gets used to being around dogs from the beginning he/she won't be afraid of t hem when he/she gets older.  

I assume this is your first baby.  You'll relax as time goes on and see how babies are built to fit into your life.  Especially if you are nursing then the baby has mega antibodies.  But even if you're not let the doggy and the baby have a relationship.  Your dog needs to know that he's still part of your family and that you love him too.</td>

The doctor said not to put soap on his scalp, it would dry it out, just rinse with water. She also said to put petroleum jelly on his head, it keeps the moisture in. My son has really sensitive and dry skin plus this cradle cap so we were told to use Dove Sensitive soap when he gets a bath and all these non-baby lotions and hydrocortizone cream and oral medication....wow!

Wal-Mart and other stores sale water color paints, go outside and place a large piece of cardboard or paper down and let them paint, this enforces color recognition, hand eye coordination, and creativity.

Be sure to always talk in normal voice and use real words and sentences, "no baby talk", this will only prove to develop their speech more quickly.  Don't give into the "grunts and wines" when they want something try to get them to tell you what they want.

<td>When will I know the true eye color?</td>
<td>my daughter was born with this funky dark gray blue color by one month they were dark grey brown and by two months they were a beautiful medium brown which they still are now at almost ten months 

Dr. David Geller, pediatrician says " Babies of African and Asian descent are usually born with brown eyes that stay brown. Caucasian babies are often born with steel gray or dark blue eyes; they may stay gray or blue or turn green, hazel, or brown by the time they're 9 months old. That's because a child's irises (the colored part of the eye) may gain more pigment in the months after she's born, but they won't get "lighter" or more blue. (Green, hazel, and brown eyes actually have more pigment than grey or blue eyes, even if they appear lighter in color.)"</td>

<td>I m mom of a week older scared of giving him sponge bath coz dont know what to do??</td>
<td>Its okay, we have all been there girlfriend! If you are not comfortable giving him a sponge bath. So be it. Lay your baby on the bed. Take a wash cloth and gently wipe the babys face and softly wipe the scalp. The part of the scalp that sinks in on the top is called the soft spot. Be very careful with this area. The soft spot is the part of the skull that has not closed yet. Continue along the babies body arms, legs etc. each part of the Baby gently washing each area. You will want to use a very mild cleanser like baby wash or baby shampoo. Do not worry about making a lather. Wash very softly. Just kind of wipe. The baby does not have to be fully undressed. You can wash the top section. And then the Bottom section. The navel area is not healt at this point. Leave it alone. Also if your baby is a boy and had circumsission, just sqeeze clean water on the area. Then jently wipe the testies. Turn the baby to the side so you can wash his back and bottom. I always washed the bottom and such last. if the baby is a little girl. Carefully wash the vigina. Do not wipe upwards tward the navel. Always wipe tward the butt. Never wipe the inside fold of the vigina tward the navel, go the oppisite direction. You do not want to place bactria in the vigina, so wash in the oppisate direction. The temp. of the water should be warn. Use your elbo to test the water. Constantly recheck your water on your wash rag. Make sure it is not to cold. And never never never never wash or place a baby in water you have not checked. it may be to hot and burn the delicate skin. You wil become less scared each time you wipe your baby off, before long you will be a sponge bath pro. Then you can write and ask how to give a baby a bath lol. Good Luck, You can do this. It sounds to me like you are a great mom. Because you werent sure how to do some thing so you ask. That is a wonderful mother.</td>

If the engorgement happens again, use a warm compress on the area and do see your OB/GYN. You may also want to ask about a consultation with a lactation specialist.  Many of us didn't have mothers or other female relatives who breastfed so it's good to talk to someone who is experienced.</td>

All of the sudden it seems she has gone from a baby to more of a toddler. She can feed herself little finger foods and has become less interesting in nursing. Her personality has also come out more- she's very "bossy" and at times has an attitude! She's also experiencing some stranger anxiety and seperation anxiety but it is starting to ease up now that she is able to get around better by herself. 
Hope this helps. All babies are different though. I like to check her progress with all the many baby websites out there. The book, What to expect during the first year is also good.</td>

Chaim=Chah|im  (ch is like a choking sound, like a scratching in your throat.  the a is the short "A" sound)-emphasis on the "cha"

Matai=Ma|tayee  ("ma" is like when some children call their moms "Ma". tayee is like the name tyler-the "ty" part.)-emphasis on the "tai"

Tavi=Ta|vi  ("ta" like like when children say, "Ma", but for "Ta".  "vi"  is with the short "I" sound, like when you say, melee-the "ee".)-emphasis on the "Ta", if you put the emphasis on the "Vi", it would be a command to "bring"

Tovi=to|vi  same thing as tavi, just the "To" is like "mold", just no "w" sound while saying the "o" sound.

Uri=U|ri  (pronounced-  oo | ree) -emphasis on the "U"</td>

<td>How do I get my 3 month old to not cry so much?</td>
<td>My son hated his carseat, too.  For about a month, he'd cry every time he was in it.  Eventually he got used to it though, and didn't cry anymore.  Just make sure the straps are adjusted to the correct height an aren't too tight.  Also, make sure to check the strap in the crotch area to make sure that's at the right adjustment (no, I'm not being crude.  Our carseat had 2 settings there).  Unfortunately, you just have to suffer through it.  He has to be in his carseat for his own safety in an accident, so he'll have to adjust</td>

<td>Best eating accessories for first-time solid feeding (spoons, plates, bowls, etc)?</td>
<td>If your baby is just starting solid food, all you need are baby spoons and a few plastic bowls. There are gerber spoons with rubber tips that's good. And there are also spoons that changes color if the food is too hot, to let you know so as not to burn baby's mouth. 

You'll need bowls. If your baby can't finish a whole jar of food, it's best to put half in a bowl to feed baby, and the half in the jar, so you can put it in the refrigerator for use later in the day. If you use a jar, and dip a sppon in it that has touched your baby's mouth, it will promote bacteria grown in the jar and your baby food won't last long before you have to throw it out.

<td>how to do get my 9 month old girl to sleep thru the night with out waking up every hour.?</td>
<td>What are naps like during the day?  This has a huge impact on her night time sleeping habits.  A 9 month old should be sleeping anywhere from 14-16 hours in a 24 hour period.  She needs morning and afternoon naps of at least 1 hour each, 2 hours is better, but you take what you can get sometimes.   She really should spend no more that 2 hours awake at a time and she should put in her bed awake, drowsy but awake.  She may not be sleeping at night if she's overtired from not enough sleep during the day.  I know this does not sound logical, but believe me it is biological.  I have a child of my own and day care in my home.  This is how I got my daughter to sleep through the night and how I get all the babies I keep happy and well rested during the day. And their parents are always amazed at how much longer they sleep at night after having 2 two hour naps a day.  Keeping your child awake during the day so that will sleep longer at night is a SLEEP MYTH!</td>

<td>they may have checked her for reflux however there are many false negitives with that.. have they checked her for eosinophillic esohphogitis? it oftenshowes neg results for gerd however the baby always throws everything up and is very fussy..
have u tried ellecare or neocate formula? we put our son on it and that was the one thing he could hold down, he is also on prevacid 15mg/daily

and to be honest, if you are not getting the results u want from that hospital in terms of answers i would fire doc's and switch hospitals, there is a doctor out there for you!

a gi specialist is what u guys need. 

by the way i had to fire 1 pediatrician, and 1 gi doctor, avoid 1 hospital to get answers about my son, we went from no sleep no gaining weight, 10 hospital stays in 3 months crying all day with no rest at all, to eating baby food, drinking water, etc... in just a few weeks....

its all about the right docs, and test.. we go to a childrens hospital and only to them... 
my son has severe gerd (the worst case that one gi doc had ever s een) and laryngo-tracheo malacia.... 

I am soo ooooo sorry u are going through this... my heart is with u all!!! 

and my hearts witth the little one</td>

<td>it is very easy.  The foreskin can pull back. So here are the steps.
1. Pull back the foreskin with thumb and index finger
2. Rinse with warm water
3. Release the foreskin.
No need to dry off.  Also, remember that you only need to clean under the foreskin if your baby is running the risk of infection.  The human body is an amazing thing and the body will keep everything clean on its own.  So you do not actually need to clean under the foreskin.  not for babies anyway.  A normal nice bath will do.</td>

Between unwanted advice from disgusted fellow parents and calls from her loan sharks I was on the brink of a nervous breakdown. I was embarrassed and ashamed but I took that first step - we went to see the pediatrician. He explained that our babies have a rare disorder that is caused by having parents that are too sexy. Since super sexy people like you and I are always having people admire and throw themselves at us, pheromones build up around our babies , trigger the disorder, and the nightmare begins. So don't blame yourself and know that in time it will get better.</td>

My husband now and I have a 15 month old daughter, but when we first started dating, I found out I was pregnant and did the same thing that you did.  I never told him at that time I felt like it was the best decision, because I wasn't sure where our relationship was going nor was I ready at that time to be a mother.  We have a beautiful child now, and I see no reason to bring it up to him.  As long as you don't regret your decision and you stand behind it I would just let that secret stay in the closet.  There is no reason to upset him over something you can not change and no reason for you to go through all of the "what if's". So stand by your decision that you made, and be grateful for what you have now.</td>

<td>if a person abuses his pregant girl friend and is distructive can he still have parental rights when thekidi?</td>
<td>If you want him to have no involvement with the child- including NO child-support payments, don't tell him when you're giving birth, and don't have any contact with him after you do.  Since you two are not married, his paternity would have to be legitimized either by taking a paternity test or by him signing as the baby's legal father within 60 days of birth.  If you don't initialize legitimization, he will not be recognized by law as the child's father; therefore having no parental rights.

If child-support is desired, file for it when the baby is a few months old.  You will get signed up for a paternity test, and when it comes back he's the father, they'll make him pay.  But in this case, make sure your friend starts documenting every case of abuse right now.  If he comes by the house, call the police, if he calls and harasses her, tape it, and call the police.  You have to have proof if you want to show someone is unfit as a parent.

Anyhow, if she stops dating the guy now and totally blocks him out of her life, after a while, he'll leave her alone and probably won't even try to be a part of the child's life, but to be safe, document everything now.</td>

Also it would help prevent the phelgm from collecting in her throat, thus minimizing her coughing. I don't know if you breastfeed or use formula, but it seems to me that the same principle should work either way.

<td>How do I get my three month old twins to sleep through the night?</td>
<td>well, i have two sets of twins (3yrs and 7 months) so I completely know how you feel.  My 7month olds started sleeping through the night at about 5 months and they also were on and off sleeping through the night at about 3 months.  Here are some little tips to help you out a little bit.  When they take naps during the day make sure that the window is not covered, that way they know when it is day and when it is night.  Cereal can help, but that is not a sure bet that they will sleep through the night.  Give them lots of tummy time.  Make their naptimes a little shorter in duration, maybe they are sleeping to long during the day (i know that the rest for you is a gift, but the long naps during the day are not helping you get your sleep at night).  Sleep while they are sleeping at least once while they are napping during the day if they are making you so exhausted.  Try to put them in bed at the same time everyday and have them get up at the same time each morning (mine go to bed around 8 and get up at about 8).

Well, I hope that this helps you.  I know it seems really hard now, but I promise that things will get better (at least until they start crawling and walking, exhaustion will set in once again when one goes one way and one goes the other and you are constantly running after them).</td>

<td>what do I do if my newborn sounds full of congestion?</td>
<td>If your newborn is also running a temperature you should take it to see a Doctor.  Infections can be nasty and you should rule this out. If the baby is coughing, also I recommend seeing a Doctor.  
If it is just a head cold with no temperature and no cough try rubbing some vapor rub on it's chest to help with breathing.  To clear a stuffy nose so baby can breastfeed easier try this home remedy for a nostril clearing solution which was given to me by my health nurse when my baby had a stuffy nose: 1/2 tsp salt dissolved in 300 mls warm water, use eye dropper and drop two small drops in each nostril.  Change water solution every 24 hours.  Baby will just "sniff out" the secretions.
Always remember, if in doubt, seek a professionals opinion.
Congratulations on your newborn!</td>

<td>i am nursing, and dont know wether i can have any alcohol. will it hurt the baby? or not be in my breast milk?</td>
<td>- Current research says that occasional use of alcohol (1-2 drinks) is not harmful to the nursing baby. The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Drugs classifies alcohol (ethanol) as a “Maternal Medication Usually Compatible With Breastfeeding.”
- Many experts recommend against drinking more than 1-2 drinks per week.
- It is recommended that nursing moms avoid breastfeeding during and for 2-3 hours after drinking (Hale 2002).
- There is no need to pump &amp; dump milk after drinking alcohol, other than for mom's comfort -- pumping &amp; dumping does not speed the elimination of alcohol from the milk.
- Alcohol does not increase milk production, and has been shown to inhibit let-down and decrease milk production (see below).
- If you're away from your baby, try to pump as often as baby usually nurses (this is to maintain milk supply, not because of the alcohol). At the very least, pump or hand express whenever you feel uncomfortably full - this will help you to avoid plugged ducts and mastitis.

In general, if you are sober enough to drive, you are sober enough to breastfeed. Less than 2% of the alcohol consumed by the mother reaches her blood and milk. Alcohol peaks in mom's blood and milk approximately 1/2-1 hour after drinking (but there is considerable variation from person to person, depending upon how much food was eaten in the same time period, mom's body weight and percentage of body fat, etc.). Alcohol does not accumulate in breastmilk, but leaves the milk as it leaves the blood; so when your blood alcohol levels are back down, so are your milk alcohol levels.</td>

<td>is naming RHAMZ DANIEL to a baby is okey?</td>
<td>Congratulations on the upcoming birth.  Choosing a name can be quite difficult as the child has to live with whatever you choose for the rest of his life.  My parents gave me an unusual name and I absolutely hate it and I got teased as a child. People may have difficulty in spelling it as I also have to correct people all the time on the spelling.  If it was me I would swap the names around to Daniel Rhamz.  You could always call him Rhamz at home but he is legally known as Daniel.  I personally think that he will spend the rest of his life spelling and pronouncing his name to everyone and you will probably find as he gets older he will most likely use Daniel to avoid confusion.  Good luck with the birth wish you well</td>

<td>How do you feel about breastfeeding a child until he is 3 1/2 years old?</td>
<td>Good for you! It's lazy parents (or lazy "moms") who stop breastfeeding when their baby is 2 or 3 months old, because THEY don't want to do it anymore. We always hear about the many benefits of breast milk, so the longer you give your baby breast milk, the better! If feeding a baby breast milk is recommended until they're at least 1 year old, then why stop? There are NO NEGATIVE side effects of breastfeeding a child past 1 year, but there are negatives to STOPPING too soon. So if you have your choice between stopping at 6 months or continuing until 3.5 years old, then good for you. You have made the choice to have a healthy child, and those years of breastfeeding are obviously worth it! It's much worse to have a parent stop breastfeeding when their baby is still so young than continuing for years. you did a smart thing, and more parents should continue until they feel their child is old enough. You are a wonderful parent for doing that for so many years....don't listen to anyone else, you did great!</td>

<td>Why is mixing rice cereal with formula in a bottle not good?</td>
<td>Basically there is the danger of the baby taking more than it can manage. When eating from a spoon the baby will only ingest enough to satisfy hunger. However, when drinking a bottle the baby will often suckle long after the hunger is quelled just for the pleasure of it. By adding rice cereal to the bottle you risk overloading their little digestive systems which can lead to vomiting and constipation.</td>

<td>my 3 1/2 month old is constipated, what can I do to help her?</td>
<td>A 3 1/2 month old shouldn't be getting baby food yet. Not till 6 months. Nor should they be getting juices without doctors approval.

If the baby is formula fed, make sure you are mixing the formula correctly. Don't mix it in the bottle, mix it in a larger container, like a measuring cup, so that you can be sure you are adding the correct amount of water to the correct amount of formula. 

I doubt the baby is breastfed since breastfed babies don't get constipated unless they are fed baby foods too young. If the baby IS breastfed and not pooping every day, that is completely normal and doesn't mean constipation.

If there is truly some constipation going on, go see the Pediatrician. You do not want to mess around with home remedies in a baby that young.

<td>How do i tell if its colic or just upset stomach?</td>
<td>It's usually colic when babies pull their legs in a jerky motion towards their stomach.... It's almost a reflex colicky babies have to alleviate some of the pain.  If it doesn't seem like colic, It could easily be other things.  Your baby might just be really needy and requires more cuddling and rocking than other babies.  The best way is to find out whether its colic or not is to consult your doctor.  My kids never had colic but I babysat plenty that did.  Try the airplane move where you drape them over your arms and rock them with your arms putting pressure on their stomachs... Another sure fire way to calm a colicky baby is to either put them in their car seat for a car ride or put the car seat on top of the dryer!!! Make sure you don't leave them unattended of course. Hope everything gets better.</td>

If it disappears, then you have determined the cause.  If it gets better but doesn't go away entirely, there may be other allergies in addition.  In any event, if simple things like this don't work, talk to your doctor.  You may want to get a referral to an allergist.</td>

Be wary, depending on when your milk comes in...if you can get any collostrum or milk out before your baby's born, you should try and pump and save it vs. just expelling it in the shower.  The collostrum is the first milk that's really dark, but it's what gives your baby a head start on nutrition. (VERY good for smarts and good skin)  Any extra milk that you can pump from your breast is going to be better for your baby.  once you start your child on a bottle/formula, it is going to be harder to keep them on the breast.</td>

<td>Does anyone know if it is even beneficial of only breastfeeding for the first month?</td>
<td>You should not have a problem with him going to formula after one month.  Little babies are resilient and can easily conform to just about any change.

It's very beneficial to breastfeed for any amount of time.  In the first few days, your baby will get colustrum that is very beneficial for his or her health and immune system.  After that, your baby gets any antibodies you produce if you happen to catch a cold or the flu.

It's the best food for your baby for any amount of time.  It's the only food in the world that is especially made just for your baby!  If you can't pump at work, try just pumping once or twice a day.  Your body can adapt to producing just as much as you feed or pump.  

I understand not wanting to pump.  I did it for two months after I went back to work.  It was a huge pain, and eventually I cut back and cut back so much that there was no milk left.  But I knew that the two months I pumped and sometimes supplemented with formula were worth more than just doing nothing.

Congrats and Hope this helps.</td>

<td>It sounds like you've just described my son when he was 6 months old. I suggest getting a baby carrier, and I highly recommend the Ergo (www.myfavoritebabycarrier.com). This way you can have your baby close to you at all times even if you're fixing yourself soemthing to eat.  Don't believe anyone if they tell you you're spoling your baby. At 6 months of age, your baby is too young to be manipulative. This is just his temperament and you might as well adjust to his needs. The sooner you adjust to your child's needs, the sooner you can coordinate your day so you can have some rest. 

Also, I highly recommend visiting Dr. Sears website http://www.askdrsears.com  There you can read about the benefits of co-sleeping. Is your baby sleeping with you in your bed? If not, I recommend it because this is the only way you'll get some rest.</td>

When you are breastfeeding your uterus contracts, helping it go back down to it's normal size quicker than it normally would. I had no trouble breast feeding but there was a mother on my ward who just couldn't get it right &amp; her nipples were really sore. I don't know what went wrong but she eventually had to bottle feed. This did the baby no harm at all, processed baby milks have all the nutrition that the baby needs so mothers needn't feel bad about not wanting to breast feed.

The main thing rice cereal and applesauce will do is make your daughter's diapers particularly unpleasant (particularly if you are nursing).  In addition, it will make it more likely for her to develop allergies now or in the future.

<td>Well if all he was interested in was a one night stand I don't think that he is going to be to interested in the child, he may even give you a hard time about it even being his since he was conceived during a one night stand, I know as a mother you want the best for your child but as a mother I would just be concerned about your son and nor worry about getting anything from this man.

If he is like every other typical male he will claim that the baby is not his and want to drag you through court which could prove to be a very emotionally painful ordeal.

Be strong take care of and love your son the best way you know how and don't worry about the guy OK</td>

<td>why are solid foods started for a baby only after 6 months?</td>
<td>Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended until about six months and should continue, along w/ complimentary solid foods for at least 1 year.  Technically, "weaning" begins as soon as you introduce any food other than breastmilk, but the process of weaning can (and should!) take months or years.  Breastmilk actually provides all the nutrition your baby needs until about 1 year.  There's no reason to completely wean your baby at 1 year if you and your child would like to continue nursing; in fact, there are lots of reasons to continue.  Breastmilk remains an excellent source of nutrition for as long as you nurse your child. It's also the best way to enhance your child's immune system development and protect your baby from many illnesses. Many cultures measure breastfeeding in years, not months.  Delaying solids until about 6 months is recommended for several reasons.  Early introduction of solids is associated with an increased risk of allergies, since your baby's intestines aren't mature enough to handle the foreign proteins.  Also, most weaning (baby foods) foods are lower in nutrients and calories than breastmilk, so filling your baby up with these solid foods will actually decrease the amount of nutrients your baby receives.  Some signs that your baby is ready for solid foods are:
Ability to sit up on his/her own
Loss of the tongue thrust reflex (when you put something in the baby's mouth, he/she tries to push it out)
Ability to pick up food and bring to the mouth
Increased demand to nurse that's not related to teething or illness.
Finally, showing an interest in the food you're eating.</td>

<td>Continue as long as both you and she are happy with it.  Human milk is the ideal food for as long as you continue, plus nursing has lots of other benefits to both you and her.  The longer you nurse her, the lower the risk of breast cancer for *both* of you.  It also decreases your risk of osteoporosis, and her risk of various types of cancer (including leukemia), diabetes, asthma, etc.  The World Health Organization recommends continued nursing for *at least* 2 years.</td>

<td>Should i have a 2nd baby if i'm only 19?</td>
<td>Thinking of having another baby is another big responsibility. In your case, it would be wise to think for your child and his/her future, rather than think for what you want.

There are many things to consider in your situation. Although you've just given only the 'tip of the iceberg' here, any answer that I may give may or may not be the answer you've been looking for. But in face value, you mentioned that you're only '19' and a single parent. That alone is tough already. Having a baby at your age is no light matter. I guess you've gone through a lot in life already but that shouldn't overwhelm you. I believe that your baby had given you so much joy and pride and you too, should take the opportunity to raise your kid well. Try to build your relationship with your kid first. Your responsibility with your existing child is already a lifetime commitment and to have another baby soon, may put you in a compromising situation. Once you've decided to push through with having another baby, your attention for your 2 kids is already divided and you will definitely have tons of additonal work to do. 

Be happy with your present child. Think more of him/her and his/her future. You alraady have a precious gift before you so don't take it for granted.</td>

<td>How do I wean my daughter from the breast in one day? I have to take antibiotics and have no stored milk.?</td>
<td>Your daughter's doctor will probably say she is old enough to start on whole milk.  Double check with him/her.  My children began getting cow's milk about 11 months even though they were still nursing as well.  She probably can drink from a cup now and is probably eating a nice variety of solids so she does not need to get most of her nutrition from nursing.  I was on antibiotics several times while nursing - did your doctor say you could not breastfeed while on it?  You will probably get breast engorgement.  It is very painful and can lead to a breast infection.  If the antibiotics will be a short course, you may be able to pump your milk and than dispose of it while on the medication if the doctor says not to nurse.  That way, she may not need to be weaned and when your milk is OK, you can nurse her again.  I breastfed 4 kids and they all started to wean themselves between 10-12 months.</td>

<td>My 5 mnth old son wants to nurse 8-12 x a day!  How do I get him to slow down? He hates bottles &amp; I'm sore!!</td>
<td>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends breastfeeding exclusively for the first 6 months of life.  However, most babies are not getting enough food and many doctors will tell you it is ok to introduce rice cereal at 4 months.  I had the same experience with my son, he ate constantly!  He wasn't getting enough to eat and once he started the cereal he was much more content.  Your son still needs the bulk of his nutrition from the breastmilk until at least one year of age.  I would talk to his doctor and make sure it is ok to start the rice cereal.  I was able to get my daughter to 5 months before I had to give the cereal. One other thing you might think about is he may be using you as a pacifier... My son did this early on, eating on each side for 45 minutes or more.  The doctor said if he's latching on correctly he should empty the breat in 10 minutes. Maybe that is part of it. But it sound to me like at 5 months he's jus a hungry little fellow.  Boys are bigger eaters lol.  You may even ask about giving juice as well.  Hopefully you can talk to your son's doctor and he/she can offer some sound advice.  Good luck and remember, he won't nurse forever hehe.</td>

<td>Babies Sleeping on tummys!!!!?</td>
<td>The line from the SIDS Institute is that a baby shouldn't be put to bed on their stomach until they are at least 1-yr-old.  That being said, I have it on VERY good authority that... first of all, if your baby is rolling herself from her back onto her stomach, that's okay.  If she can turn her head to the side when necessary, that is what's important.  Don't stress out about rolling her back onto her back if she has rolled herself over.  You'll driver yourself and your baby crazy all night long.  Personally, my wife and I still put our 18 month-old son to bed on his back - just habit, I guess. But, he has been rolling himself over for months and months and months.  SIDS is still a mystey to doctors.  No one quite knows what causes it; they just know some of the risk factors that you can avoid to reduce your babies chances of falling victim to it.  Don't stress out about it - but, before babies can roll themselves onto their stomachs themselves, you should try to avoid putting them to bed on their stomachs - you can't keep your eyes and ears on them all 6-8 hrs. long.  Your baby sounds like she's in the clear as far as that risk factor goes, though.  You should check out SIDS.org fo all of the other risk factors - you'd be surprised by some of them.</td>

Growing up, I never imagined I would be. In today's world, there are few families that can afford to have only one income. A woman has to be prepared to work. 

I am so happy that my husband provides so well, and that he agrees that limiting the extravagances in our lives (ie: only having one car) is worth the inconvieniences, so that our children can have the best start in their lives by having their mom at home with them.

It's such a wonderful life. I'm the only one responsible for the type of child my daughter is. (The baby's a bit young for these explainations.) She's sweet and polite and gentle. She can count to 14, and she's getting the hang of her abc's. She knows animals and colors and songs and her prayers. 
The other day, she made the lullaby in her brother's stuffed lamb play. She said "That's a lamb." I asked "and what does a lamb say?" She faithfully replied "baa!"
I said "that was a very good baa, honey", and she looked at me and said "It's just a sheep, mommy. Sheep say baa."

I can't imagine missing things like that.

My husband hopes that I can stay home until the kids are in second grade or so. I hope so, too. I wouldn't trade this life for anything else in the world.

What I do when I feed him is to keep a soft wash cloth right under his mouth when I feed him. It will catch any milk that might dribble and also keeps his clothes clean. Also I found it helps to wash under his chin when I put him in his cloth wash basin. When I turn him over to wash his back I support his chest with my hand. If your baby can hold her neck up she will hold her head up while you do this. This gives you easier access to her neck. Just make sure you have a tight grip on her because when they are wet they sure are slippery!</td>

<td>It depends on the purpose of the blanket. If it's for warmth, make sure the blanket is snugly wrapped around the baby with all the edges tucked in. If it's for decoration, hang it on the wall. If you're still worried that she'll get it pulled up over her face use a blanket with an open weave so that even if it does get pulled over her face she'll still be able to breath. Remember that if you're comfortable with the temperature so is she. That goes for awake and sleeping.</td>

However, my second son who is 6 months old now doesn't have reflux and can make some pretty strange sounds and some are throaty ones like that but they are obviously playful ones that he has control over. Your baby may not be doing it on her own though or in a playful way.
I say, with almost any hint of concern when it comes to infants, you should stress to your doctor how you really feel about what you're seeing in your daughter. If your doctor can't put your mind at ease, you should try looking for a second opinion. That doesn't mean you don't have to ditch your normal doctor just because he takes something lightly that you feel shouldn't be, but having another opinion can help determine if your concerns are valid or not. :)

<td>First off, RELAX!!! My 7 mo old is doing the same thing. It's havoc on us, but we adapt. 

Yes, your new schedule has some affect on her sleep, as well as teething. She could also be going thru a growth change. 

We have had to put my daughter in her swing (it's a lay back, not a sit up)and let her watch TV. It works for her and us. She goes right back to "normal" within a couple of days. (She's no different than other kids and people. Sometimes you just can't sleep.)

I understand your frustration, because moms usually use those naptimes as mommy time, whether it is to relax, clean, whatever. I was worried too...even after 6 other kids, (but they are all different). 

I take each day as it comes. She used to have a "set" bedtime too...she set it, and now that is out of whack.

I just have to change my daily plans. So what, if laundry/dishes gets done a few hours later or not at all for the day...I enjoy her crawling, standing, walking...just being. I just have to work harder and faster...or smarter...when she is asleep.

I worry too, when she DOES sleep thru the night. Mainly, b/c I can't remember what I did to make it happen.

This too will pass, but if you continue to worry, contact your ped and discuss it with him/her.

Just now saw your additional info. Reduce the blankets and remove the nite-lite. There's been studies that babies under two who sleep with a nite-lite have poorer eyesight. I understand your philosophy for it, but I have never used one in the bedroom..they go in the hall, living room, kitchen and bathroom.</td>

If the fever persists, is higher than 102 or you are unable to bring it down, go to the E.R.

P.S.  NEVER, EVER give a baby aspirin unless specifically ordered to by your doctor.  Aspirin can lead to a serious condition called Reyes Syndrome when given to infants and children!</td>

So he'd need about 30 women over a period of 24 years at least and he'd better have a ton of money to support them; one is bad enough.

<td>my child will only sleep in her swing.  Has anyone had this problem?</td>
<td>YES! My daughter was the same way. She never liked to sleep on her back, side or anything we tried. I finally gave up and I in hindsight I don't regret it one bit. We let her sleep in her swing in the room with us. We spent a million dollars on batteries because she liked it moving. At the time I was actually afraid to admit to anyone that I let my child sleep in a swing but I felt like she must be the most comfortable that way so I let her. After learning more about SIDS and GERD (which is like baby acid reflux) I was happy I let her sleep sitting up. I had remembered just having acid reflux so bad when I was pregnant with my daughter. The doctors and books told me to sleep sitting propped up to help keep the acid down.  I also had a hard time breathing because of her sitting near my lungs and I remember that if  I sat up and on an angle I could breath the best. It almost seemed like when I paid attention nature prepared me to be able to empathize with how my daughter would be feeling in the days to come. The lungs are one of the last things to develop in a baby and I learned in all of my reading of baby books and various forums like this one that I came to learn a little later that underdeveloped lungs is now suspected to play a cause is SIDS. I was glad I had trusted my instincts. I just put myself in my daughters shoes and thought if this is how she is comfortable then it must be what is right for her. I know the books say do this, this and this and I am grateful for all of the great knowledge they provide but sometimes we just have to quiet our mind, look at our child and put ourselves in their shoes. It felt good and I knew I was making the right decision.  Then! After I started telling people I had 2 people tell me the same thing happened. All 3 of us gave in and let our children sleep in the swing for the sake of our own sanity and hoping baby new best. None of us regret it. I was worried her little spine wouldn't form properly. She's a happy perfectly formed 2 year old who can't be slowed down :-) my friends is 4 and healthy as a horse and my other friends girl is 7 and doing great too.  What a great mommy you must be to be in here checking out stuff for your daughters best interest. Keep up the good work mommy and trust YOUR instincts ;-) By the way, just about the time I thought she was too big for the swing she was ready for the bed all on her own.</td>

After I stopped nursing each of my kids by breasts went back to the size they were before and they are just the same way now.  I don't know who got the idea that if you breast feed you'll wind up with larger breasts--I'm VERY glad it wasn't true!  I was a DD before kids, wound up being in an GG while nursing and am back to a DD.  Sure, there's some very slight stretch marks--mine are all gone now and have been gone for longer than I can remember.  There's nothing that breast feeding takes away from your breasts--what you get after the birth is only there till you stop nursing.

<td>GBS infection?</td>
<td>Group B Strep Infection

Group B streptococcus (GBS) infection is a common bacterial infection that is rarely serious in adults, but can be life-threatening to newborns. GBS affects about 1 in every 2,000 babies born in the United States. Between 10 and 30 percent of pregnant women carry the GBS bacterium in the vagina or rectal area, but few babies of these women actually develop an infection. Group B streptococcus should not be confused with Group A streptococcus, which commonly causes strep throat and, rarely, a potentially deadly destruction of flesh.

Since the early 1990s, when widespread efforts to prevent GBS began, newborn GBS infections have declined by about 70 percent. In 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued updated guidelines to help further reduce the number of newborn GBS infections. The new guidelines help health care providers identify and treat pregnant women who are at risk of transmitting GBS to their babies. The steps they recommend usually can prevent the infection in newborns.

How does a pregnant woman get GBS?
Anyone can carry GBS, but few become sick from it. The bacterium lives in the lower genital tract or gastrointestinal system, along with many other bacteria that are harmless to most people. The bacterium causes illness primarily in pregnant women and their babies and, occasionally, in the elderly and in adults with other illnesses such as cancer and diabetes.

How does a baby get infected with GBS infection?
There are two forms of GBS infection in infants: early-onset and late-onset. Babies with an early-onset infection develop symptoms within seven days of birth, most commonly within the first day of life. Babies with a late-onset infection develop symptoms between seven days and three months of age.

About 80 percent of all GBS infections in newborns are early-onset. Early-onset infections almost always are transmitted from mother to baby around the time of delivery. Late-onset infections can be contracted at delivery or acquired after birth from contact with the mother or other people who are GBS carriers.

If a pregnant woman carries the GBS bacterium in her vagina or rectum at the time of labor and delivery, there is a 1-in-100 chance that her baby will become sick from GBS infection. The risk rises to 4 percent if a pregnant woman carries the bacterium and develops certain risk factors. These risk factors include: preterm delivery before 37 weeks gestation); prolonged rupture of the membranes (longer than 18 hours without delivering the baby); or fever (100.4° F or higher) during labor. Other risk factors include having a previous pregnancy resulting in a GBS-infected baby or having a urinary tract infection caused by GBS. Doctors believe that babies who become sick with GBS infection take the bacterium into their bodies by ingesting GBS-containing amniotic or vaginal fluids during labor and delivery.

What are the symptoms of GBS infection in the newborn?
Babies with an early-onset infection suffer from one or more of the following conditions: pneumonia, sepsis (blood infection) and, less commonly, meningitis (infection of the membranes surrounding the brain). Babies with a late-onset infection usually have sepsis or meningitis.

In spite of treatment with antibiotics, about 5 percent of babies with GBS die. Preterm babies are more likely to die from the illness than are full-term babies. Most babies who survive GBS go on to develop normally. However, among those who develop meningitis, up to 50 percent suffer lasting neurologic damage that can include cerebral palsy, sight and hearing loss, mental retardation, learning disabilities and seizures.

How can newborn GBS infection be prevented?
According to 2002 CDC guidelines, all pregnant women should be screened for GBS at 35 to 37 weeks of pregnancy. The health care provider takes a swab of the vagina and rectum and sends the sample to a laboratory for a culture to test for the presence </td>

<td>Should I worry about my baby in her crib?</td>
<td>First of all TAKE OFF THE BUMPERS! My daughter started doing the same thing when she was about that age, she's now almost 6 months. The first time I walked into her room and saw her with her face pressed into the bumper I nearly fainted. You wouldn't put your child face down to sleep on a pillow right? Of course not, but that's essentially what you're doing with the bumper. It increases the risk of rebreathing, breathing back in the exhaled CO2, which in turn increases the risk of SIDS. At first I was worried about my daughter putting her arm through the bars and getting it caught but after 2 months I realize how silly that was. She has, on occasion, woken up with a red mark on her head from sleeping against the bars but who hasn't woken with funny red marks from hands or pillows pressed against their face or arm when sleeping?

<td>My first daughter got her first tooth at 5 months (and she was born 6 weeks preemie, so that'd really have been 3 1/2 months old.)

My second daughter got her first tooth at 10 months.

Because it was taking longer with my second child, I asked my Mother-in-Law (a nurse), if I should worry about it. She said "You can worry about it, but that won't make it happen any faster." That made sense, so I just let it go.

They can take a long time to finally pop through, but once one does, the others start showing up left and right. By the way - I'd take as many teething-free days as I could get because you're headed into cranky and drooling territory right quick! ;)

Good Luck and Take care! :)</td>

<td>What would cause a 15 mth old too run a fever of 104.2.....?</td>
<td>Babies and toddlers, when they have fevers, run a lot hotter than adults do. They just don't regulate their temperature very well.

Many pediatricians say not to give Tylenol or Motrin (unless the child suffers from febrile seizures or something) unless the fever is over 102.

Febrile seizures (which one of my daughters gets) happen when a temperature spikes really quickly. If you catch that happening, you can give Tylenol and Motrin together, and then alternate them every three hours. In the case of a true, high fever, Tylenol or Motrin alone won't bring the temp down to normal, and that's OK.

My older daughter runs high temperatures with no other symptoms. It's just the way she is. Although you might mention it to your pediatrician: one of Phoebe's high temperatures was caused by a bladder infection (which we'd never have known about), and then she was diagnosed with VUR. So it's good to have it noted in the child's chart, just in case there IS something real going on.

Anyway, a high temp is scary, but not really that medically significant in most cases. Tylenol, Motrin, light clothing, lots of liquids...that's the drill.

And febrile seizures aren't a big deal, either, even though they're scary as all get out...</td>

<td>is it right for my mother to take care of her grandson as if it were hers?</td>
<td>That's a tough question.  It all depends on how the whole situation is.  

Just from what you've given, I think that Your mother should back off a bit and let the babies mother get up in the middle of the night and feed and do for the baby.  The babies mother needs to know that this child is Her responsibility, not the grandmothers.  

Seems to me that the Parents of this child don't want to grow up yet and still have their freedom.  And the only thing the grandmother is doing is making sure her new grand baby has the best and treated as such.</td>

<td>how do i deal with a 4 month old who is teething???</td>
<td>There are teething rings you can get fairly inexpensive at walmart, Kmart, shopko, Walgreen's... etc, 

also you can get oragell which is designed for infants,

another thing i did for my sister was get the bathroom size Dixie cups and freeze water in them, then while i held her and watched over to be sure no chunks of ice came i let chew on the ice with her gums.  the reason i used the Dixie cups rather than ice cubes is you can tear the paper down some and still have some paper to hold on to, and also, there is much less chance of the baby aspirating the ice in the Dixie cups compared to an ice cube, which can become slippery and easily be aspirated by an infant.

Oh and um ... BTW, ... whiskey is not an alternative for an infant</td>

One crib, they shared, one changing table, Aside from the two car seats, and doubling up on diapers, you can manage with one of most things. Plus, I nursed, so I saved a TON on formula.

My guess, on a monthly basis, diapers at most $100-$120 a month. As they grow, diapers get more expensive. For us, the first year was the cheapest.
Didn't do formula, so if you did that would be high on a monthly babsis.
When they started solids, I spent 20-30 a week on food, as they grew. It's not as expensive as you'd first think.</td>

<td>Baby Girl Names?</td>
<td>Well, it sort of depends on if you want a traditional name, a contemporary name, an ethnic name or whatever.

Here are some of my favourite girl names:

Neila
Kerri
Christianne
Sophie
Katie
Lily or Layla
Cierra (or Sierra)

Also, I found that when naming names, the first name should sound good with the last name.  It might sound a bit strange to have a really exotic first name with a last name like Smith or Jones.  Also, I find that if you have a one or two syllable last name, then a three syllable first name sounds good.  

And, most important, if you have a child's name with three syllables, it sounds so much better when you are angry with them, for instance, "Chris-To-Pher" has such a better ring when you are angry, than say, "Tom".  If you have only a one syllable name for the first name then you will definitely have to have a two syllable name for the second name just for this reason.  (ha ha)

<td>Your experience of Birth centers in America!!?</td>
<td>I had 2 hospital births and one birth center birth and the birth center was by far more wonderful, no question. The hospital births were strapped down to bed, terrible birthing positions (until I insisted on sitting up! shesh you would think the nurses and doctors would KNOW that laying back is horrific for laboring mom-slows labor down and hurts!) and no food-which is totally ridiculous to cut a laboring woman off from food-NO studies show that if a woman needs emergency surgery that she will vomit and aspirate, it's all bullcrap. The book I listed way below will talk about the 'no food in labor' bull in better light.

As soon as I got into the water at the birth center all the pain went away, I couldn't believe it. I had epidurals with my first 2 and they were horrible, one wouldnt take right and the sticks in my back were horrible during contractions. Oh I remember it was worse than my entire 3rd labor! Plus, I now have terrible back problems where I had the epidurals-herniated discs and shooting pains that only chiropractic care can get rid of. I don't care what any doctor says about this, the epidurals caused it. 

There was a fantastic article written in the Mothering magazine (www.mothering.com) that was all about epidurals and what your doctor WON"T tell you-it's scary.

I would never use the IV drugs during labor as it goes to the baby and can stop their breathing, it's horrible.

Bradley classes are great, worked great for me with my third baby. I tell you, the birth center was wonderful, the midwives were truly caring and loving and love helping women deliver, not like a MD who goes into OB to do surgery (your chance of a c-section is like 30% in a hospital=that is HORRIFIC).

This name, when combined with the last name, can frustrate happiness, contentment, and success, as well as cause health weaknesses in the fluid and nervous system. 

Your name of Jathan gives you a highly sensitive, idealistic, and intuitive nature.
 
You could be expressive and creative in the arts, music, or drama and you have a great desire to help others.
 
Since you are not inclined to give due consideration to practical and business matters, you could miss out on reaching a level of financial success appropriate for your efforts and abilities.
 
You feel and sense much that you do not fully understand, and you can be deeply influenced through the thoughts of others without realizing just how you are being affected.
 
You are super-sensitive and intuitive.

<td>Premmies development?</td>
<td>Hi there, my daughter was born at 28 weeks and stayed in the NICU for 2 months. Did they explain adjusted or corrected age to you?  Well, it means that even though my daughter's birthday is April 10th, she was supposed to be born the first week of July so that makes her 3 months or so behind. So then you take her real age (1 year) and subtract the three months that she was early and you get 9 months. My daughter is now cruising, crawling, walking with assitance, banging things together, etc. This is normal behavior for a 9 month old which is biologically how old she really is. See what I mean? Your baby is probably right where she's supposed to be. They say that premies won't catch up to be "in line" with full term babies until they're two. You should talk to a social worker (Catholic Charities or one at the hospital where your daughter was born) and see if they have anything like a "Stepping Stones" program like they do here in NY. It's a program that pays for an occupational therapist and a physical therapist to come once a week each and work with your baby to ensure the best motor skills possible. Also, get a letter stating her birth weight and go to the Social Security Administration near you and she may qualify for SSI up to $600 (depending on where you live) per month for assisted income for you. Trust me, there is nothing to worry about. Once your preemie comes home and she's been cleared and eating OK and not having any apnea or Brady spells, you are good to go. DO NOT let her sleep on her tummy. They might've let her in the NICU but she was on monitors. At least until she starts rolling over on her own, let her sleep on her back. It's just something you can do for your peace of mind. If you have ANY questions about preemies, I've had 2 and my parents are college professors, so you know I have almost every book written on the subject. rip_shiloh@yahoo.com Hope I was of some help, good luck with everything!</td>

Keep in mind that mom or dad has to change this little one in a public restroom and they can be very drafty. So put snaps and buttons on the outfits so that only the diaper area is exposed. After that, just use old fashion magazines from the past. Go to your library and see if they have some old books about styles of the past. Since you want to do the 60's, keep in mind that tied dyed cloth and bell bottoms were all cool. Also ponchos, peasant blouses, Nehru jackets, head bands, flowers for the hair, smock tops, and colorful patches on jeans were all the rage. I still want a pair of white Go-go boots!

<td>how often should i bathe a new born child?</td>
<td>A newborn should be sponge-bathed until the umbilical cord area is healed/falls off. Then, once every 3 days is about all a baby needs, unless of course he/she has a particularly messy poop or vomit. After about 3 months, a bath every other day is fine as long as your baby seems to enjoy it. I started daily baths at 6 months because my daughter loved it and it helps establish a routine. My pediatrician and nurses all said no lotions until 10 weeks, just to be safe. Good luck with your baby!</td>

<td>Play a game starting at your baby's arm.  As the child let's you wipe thier arm say "Thank You" in your soft mommy voice.  The move on up until you get to baby's mouth.  Try to clean his nose softly and say " thank You" as well.  Now use a different cloth and wet it.  Let the baby suck on the cloth and slowly pull it out.  I may cause tug of war, but we know have clean gums.  It also teackes baby to say thank you.</td>

<td>For the past week, my baby has been crying a lot during the day, why?</td>
<td>Cholic.  Some babies go into sensory over load about that age.  Everything is new for them.  The were in the womb for nine months as I'm sure you well remember.  It could also be teething or a mild ear infection.  It could also be separation anxiety.  Babies don't understand or think the way we do.  That's why peek-a-boo is fun.  If baby doesn't see it, it no longer exists to baby.  That's why it is so exciting when that thing comes back out from behind the blanket and then disappears again.</td>

<td>How do I know when my bottle fed 2 month year old is ready to move from level 1 nipple to level 2 nipple?</td>
<td>Typically, you should start your baby on a level 2 nipple at the age of 3 months, or when you begin solids. 

If you baby is taking longer to finish their bottle, and it sucking so hard that the nipple flattens out, then its time to switch to level 2. 

When switching to level 2, keep a close eye on your baby. The flow is a little faster, so watch to see if your baby starts coughing or gagging. If your baby does, then try switching back to level 1. 

Good luck!</td>

<td>My babies are on apnea monitors and their skin is irritated &amp; raw from the electrodes. How do I help heal it?</td>
<td>My son is also on an Apnea Monitor, due to the sudden death of our first born. At the site of his electrodes, the skin gets reddish, raw, and ruff. I too asked my doctor about this. Unfortunetly, they dont make any other electrodes to help. And putting lotion on the site can cause the electrodes to not pick up the needed responses, causing more Loose-Lead alarms to go off(if you have experienced the loose-lead alarm, you know how annoying they can get!...lol)

Some things that you can do to help putting a little drop of water on the outside of the electrode(the part that touches the skin). The water wont interfer with the machine, and may help with the skin drying out.

Also, baby powder! I would suggest Huggies Liquid Baby Powder, because it easier to apply than regualr baby powder, but any will do. Baby powder works to help with the chaffing of the skin, and also wont interfe with the electrodes.

I dont mean to sound rude, but try not to listen to those who have never worked with an Apnea Monitor for an infant, because as good as their advice may sound, sometimes their suggestion can make things worse. Lotions, vaseline, and other oils and gels sound like a good idea, but they interfer with how the electrodes work, and their response to pick up signals. Your best bet would be the dab of wand/or baby powder. I know its not much of an option, but hopefully your little ones wont have to be on the Apnea Monitor for too much longer.

Good luck!</td>

It is for external application only.  If your baby has a rash inside, it would be best to call your pediatrician.  It is, however, safe to apply the cream to the outside part of her labia, which is the part you would spread apart to see the vaginal opening.  If a little cream goes inside the thicker, outside (majora) part of the labia, that will not hurt anything, just do not spread it apart to apply the cream into that area where the thinner (minora) labia and the clitoris is located.</td>

<td>You may try taking a receiving blanket and warming it up in the dryer.  Place the warm blanket on your baby's stomache and bundle your baby like they did in the hospital.  Also try different burping positions, like sitting your baby up on your knee with your hand under the baby's chin and chest supporting her. Rub her back in a circular motion and the burp her back. Don't be afraid of burping, you may not be burping enough or hard enough. You don't want to hurt the baby but you also don't want to do it to lightly. If your baby is wanting to eat every hour it's probably because her tummy hurts. I would try what I suggested and get her back on the 3 - 4 hour schedule. You might try different types of pacifiers and you may have to hold it until she gets used to sucking on a different object than what her milk comes from. Hope this helps.</td>

Perhaps she has an ear infection, because an ear infection can really hurt when drinking from a bottle. Try gently pushing on her ear and pulling it, and see if it seems to hurt her. If so, you should suggest to the doctor that he should check her ears. He should also check her throat.

Another alternative is a stomach problem. Does she have diarrhea? Is she constipated? These are all questions the doctor should have asked. However, sometimes doctors simply mess up. 

Part of learning to be a parent is learning to trust your own instincts. If you feel something is wrong, don't be afraid to go back to the doctor and ask him to check these things, even if he already checked them.</td>

This caught me by surprise because when I was a little baby, my Mom used a dresser drawer as a crib for me.

For "Juliebean" above, the drawer was padded with lots of blankets, so it wasn't like I was sleeping on cold, hard wood.
As for your "posturepedic", not everyone in America can afford brand new cribs. 
It's not like your stuffing the baby into a shoe box; and you can take your "child abuse" comment, and blow it out the window.

People, you all need to get real for a change.

<td>How many ounces should I be feeding my 2 1/2 month old son?</td>
<td>Your baby is going through a growth spurt, this generally happens without a dought at 3 weeks of age and 6 weeks of age.  They feel that they always need "topped off" or extra full during this time. Generally babies need an ounce per hour. So if you fed them 3 hours ago and they are hungry, they will need at least 3 ounces.  But it depends on your baby, later on if you still feel like it is constantly hungry, maybe you should try distancing your feeding times so you can feed a greater quanity at one time.  My son ate anywhere between 4-8ounces every four hours when he was that age.  But after a week he went back to 4-5 ounces every four hours.</td>

Enfamil ProSobee LIPIL (basically if baby cant handle lactose). if none of this works then definitely check with the doctor.

<td>If I get sick, can my son, who is breastfeed get sick also?</td>
<td>Your son may get sick, but not through breastfeeding. He may catch what you have through kissing, handling him...etc. It's hard to avoid passing a virus around when you're in close contact 24 hrs a day. So keep breastfeeding, as your milk will unlikely be affected. But you will however pass antibodies through your milk so that's a big plus for your baby.

Just try to avoid taking certain kinds of medicine. Check with your doctor, or pharmacist if you want to take certain medicines to see if it's ok for lactating mothers.</td>

They  do have flavorings for liquid medications but because Zantac is so bitter and strongly unappealing it is hard to mask the taste of it no matter what flavor you try. I have played around with all the flavors in it at work and the bitter minty taste still comes out in it. If your baby is old enough to have solid foods you could put it in a little bit of applesauce also, but still make sure he takes the full amout that you put it in.

He hates drinking milk now, would rather eat baby food all day (peas at that) He belives he is a big man! His ped. said since he is eating solid foods now a minimun of 16 oz of milk needs to be drank in 24 hrs. Since my son doesnt like drinking his formula anymore I mix it in honey wheat cereal for babies. That was I know he is gettin some milk there. He eats cereal 2 times a day with 3-4 ounces mixed in it. THe rest of the formula is drank in the 24 hr period. I once read in a website to times your baby weight by 2.5. That is the amount of formula he should be drinking. But if you think about it, that is realistic for babies eating solids also. Can u imagine a 20 lbs baby eating solid foods plus drinking 50 oz of formula? That is only for babies drinking only formula. I would go by what my ped. said. at least 16 oz per day if your baby is eating things such a baby foods, cereal etc. IF you would like to email me we can share our experiences and maybe offer each other some advice.

<td>Absolutely talk to him in all 3 languages!!  A baby can learn several languages all at once--and learn them all perfectly!  He will probably mix up the languages for the first 2-3 years, but by 3 years old, he will have them mostly separated--and even be able to remember which language to speak to whom (and probably guess about strangers, as well!).

The longer you wait to start with any of the languages, the longer it will take to learn that one.  While a 5 year old can learn a new language perfectly, it will take longer than a 2 year old, who will need longer than a newborn.

Learning more languages is also the greatest gift you can give your child!  Learning more than one language actually *rewires* the brain to make learning the *next* language even easier--and improves non-language learning, as well!  It is wonderful for any child, and will *particularly* help a child who has learning problems (including language problems), so there is no reason *any* child should be denied the possibility to learn an extra language.</td>

Both my boys were breastfed until they were around age 2, it was totally easy and wonderful to nurse past one, there is NO magic reason to stop nursing at 365 days of age, it's only an American thing. Babies past one year old still need mothers milk, not cows breast milk-it makes no sense if you think about it.

One word of advice-NEVER accept nursing advice from someone who has failed at it (nursed at least one year), it's like taking financial advice from a broke person, they haven't a clue and want to drag you down from doing what is great because of their guilt or whatever.

See these sites for some of the best info and people you could imagine, start early before the birth of your precious child:

These are some great books to have also, Dr. Sears is the best-

What Every Parent Should Know
About Infant Formula 

by Katie Allison Granju




By now, every doctor and parent in America has heard the news: breastfeeding is best for babies. What's not-so-old news is the growing body of evidence demonstrating that commercial infant formulas are simply not good enough. While commercial infant formulas are commonly perceived to be the medically recommended second-choice infant food after breastfeeding, the World Health Organization (WHO) actually states: "The second choice is the mother's own milk expressed and given to the infant in some way. The third choice is the milk of another human mother. The fourth and last choice is artificial baby milk."

The quality of infant formula is of paramount importance in the United States--where, despite the American Academy of Pediatrics' endorsement of breastfeeding for a minimum of twelve months and WHO's recommendations to breastfeed for at least two years--only slightly more than half of all mothers offer their newborns any breast milk at all. Fewer than twenty-two percent of American babies are still breastfed at five months of age, and this figure drops to under ten percent by twelve months. These statistics mean that the vast majority of American babies rely solely on the synthetic infant nutrition known as infant formula for their critical first year of life. 

Minority and disadvantaged children are most likely to be fed a diet of artificial breast milk substitutes. The United States government's food program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) serves the nutritional needs of low-income women and children, and is the single greatest purchaser of commercial infant formula. WIC provides free infant formula to thirty-seven percent of all infants born in the United States at a cost of almost $600 million annually.

With so many American babies--particularly those at socioeconomic risk--relying on this single food source for their growth and nutritional well-being, it is incumbent upon those concerned with infant-maternal health issues to examine breast milk substitutes carefully and critically. Unfortunately, many health-care professionals and public-health officials avoid scrutini</td>

First ask the mother-to-be what them she'd like and go from there.  Look for an affordable place to hold the baby shower, then print a lot of things yourself if you want, like the invitations, thank you cards..etc by getting graphics for them on the net.  Do finger foods, cookies &amp; punch.  Have other people that want to help pitch in but be prepared that some will back out or not do their part so you won't be fustrated at the last moment.  Go with the flow at all times, smile and be possitive...as long as you look in control, the mother-to-be will feel everything is just fine.

As for printable games, there are several different websites that let you do that for free.  And give you free advice &amp; even give you a list of what to do next for organization.

Good luck...and remember have fun doing it for the person you love!!  God bless.</td>

<td>what is colic and how do you get rid of it?</td>
<td>Your baby cries every afternoon for hours at a time, and the crying has worn you down to the point where you feel like joining in. What could be upsetting your child?
 
Though all newborns cry and show some fussiness, when a child who is otherwise healthy cries for more than 3 hours per day, it is a condition known as colic, which is perfectly normal, and eventually goes away on its own. 
 
It's been estimated that up to 25% of all infants have colic. It usually starts between the 3rd and 6th week after birth, and goes away on its own by the time the baby is 3 months old. If the baby seems to still have colic after that time, the infant might have some sort of health problem.
 
To determine whether your child has colic, you may first want to make sure that he or she isn't crying for another medical reason. Here are some key facts about colic:
Colicky babies have a healthy sucking reflex and a good appetite and are otherwise healthy and growing well. Sick babies may appear colicky but won't feed well and won't have the same strong sucking reflex. 
Colicky babies like to be cuddled and handled. Sick babies appear uncomfortable when they are handled and are difficult to console. 
Colicky babies may spit up from time to time, but if your baby is actually vomiting, and/or losing weight call your child's doctor. Vomiting repeatedly is not a sign of colic. 
Colicky babies typically have normal stools. If your baby is difficult to console and has diarrhea or blood in the stool, call your child's doctor. 
What Causes Colic?
Doctors aren't sure what causes colic. Some have suggested that colic is caused by a milk allergy, but doctors now believe that this is rarely, if ever, the case. Breastfed babies get colic too, however, in some cases, dietary changes by the mother have caused the colic to subside.

Doctors also now believe that colic is probably not caused by gas. Research suggests that more often than not, colicky babies develop gas by swallowing too much air while they're crying. 
 
There is some evidence that colic occurs because there is a problem with the movement of food through the baby's digestive system, either it's moving too fast or too slow.
 
Some doctors think that colic is due to the baby's temperament. Some babies just take a little bit longer to get adjusted to the world or a day and night cycle. 
 
Many parents worry that there is something they are doing to somehow cause the colic, or that they are not being a good parent. But there's no evidence that a parent's anxiety or personality has anything to do with causing colic.
 
Many doctors also believe that another possible cause of colic could be undiagnosed gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
 
Treating Colic
There is no single treatment that has been proven to make colic go away. But there are some things you can do for your colicky baby that may make life easier for both of you. 
First, make sure your baby is not hungry. If your baby is not hungry, don't try to continue the feeding. Instead, try to console your baby. You won't be "spoiling" the baby with your attention. Rather, you'll be showing your child that you will respond to his or her needs. You can also: 
Walk with your baby or sit in a rocking chair, trying various positions. 
Try burping your baby more often during feedings. 
Place your baby across your lap on his or her belly and rub your baby's back. 
Put your baby in a swing. The motion may have a soothing effect. 
Put your baby in an infant seat in the back of the car and go for a ride. The vibration and movement of the car often calm a baby.
Try music tapes, some babies respond to sound as well as movement.
Caring for a colicky baby can be extremely frustrating, so be sure to take care of yourself, too. Don't blame yourself or your baby for the constant crying - colic is nobody's fault. Try to relax, and remember that your ba</td>

<td>What items we need to shop for a new baby? Don't know boy or girl yet? What should we prepare in advance?</td>
<td>My mother had twins a few months ago and i still have a list of the things she bought ahead of time:
diapers(i reccommend huggies or pampers or they will wet their clothes)
onesies, can't ever have 2 many of those, and they come in white so u can't go wrong!
bibs
burb cloths(or cloth diapers actually work better because they cover a larger area of your shoulder when u burb them
socks
car seats of course
a would reccommend a investing into a swing
a diaper pail
baby bed, sheets, waterproof mattress pad, comforter, and I would reccommend something that holds the baby in place so they would roll onto their stomachs(unless thats how you want them 2 lay of course)
baby wipes, shampoo, lotion, a stroller, baby bath towels, washcloths, baby bath tub, and many more things, good luck with your baby, sorry it this wasn't what you were lookin 4!
sorry, i 4got somethin, you will need lots of formula, or if you are going to breastfeed I would get a Medela pump
and don't 4get bottles!(get the ones with seals that way when you put them in a cooler they won't spill out!
you will also need:
a diaper bag, a cooler, some ice packs, and a lot of toys!
one last thing i promise, pacifiers!
ok, nevermind, theres more!
I don't suggest the oneies that button down the front because if the baby rolls onto the buttons they would hurt in my opinion, I would get the ones that button at the botttom
tylenol
mylicon(cant spell)
pediacare
Desitin(diaper rash cream)
a changing pad and or changing table
baby monitor
baby mobile
a humidifier in case of a cold
if you are going to breastfeed I would reccommend a boppy, my mom purchased one and she loved it, but with twins she has to give them formula also and so the boppy isn't used, if you are going to formula feed I wouldn't get one
also a bassinet is handy for when a baby wakes up in the middle of the night(they usually fit the baby until around 3-6 months, depending on the size of the baby
a would get a rocking chair or love seat(rocking small couch) for the nursery if you have one
last thing that I can think of is a stroller and I think that I already mentioned that, but I know that someone will say to get a stroller with the car seat installer thingy, DONT
it dosen't work near as well as you think, it's also really bulky and hard 2 fold up!

Good luck!

<td>Is it o.k to wean a 9 month old from breast feeding? the baby takes solids well.?</td>
<td>the best thing, of course, is to wait until they are 1 yr old...however, if you were going to stop breastfeeding, then 9 months would be the earliest that it would be the safest...have you tried perhaps pumping your milk to give to your baby? by now he/she should only be on 2-3 feedings of milk a day...that would be a way to keep your baby on breastmilk without having to go through the expense of formula (i pumped in front of the tv and used that time as "me time" and then just froze it to use at a later time)...also, when you just stop breastfeeding, most doctors will not give out the pills to dry up your milk and you'll engorge like crazy...you can't pump b/c it stimulates it more...you'd have to grin and bare it...so, if you pump and gradually pump less and less for fewer feedings, then it will ease the whole drying of the milk process for you...i was down to one feeding a day when my daughter started showing signs of wanting to ween...so i never engorged...
however, if that's not a path you want to take, you shouldn't really have any problems with formula...however, formula has a habit of adding lots and lots of gas...so make sure to constantly be burping your baby (after every couple of ounces or so)...
if your baby takes solids, well, that's wonderful and keep giving him/her their solids...just relace the milk with formula...your baby is too young for cow's milk...
once your baby turns 1 yr old, you can start on whole milk and just give him/her lots of dairy, like cheese, yogurt, etc...
i personally, if i'd had that problem, would have pumped to not only save $$$, but b/c breastmilk is way healthier and well, if i was going to go through the beginning pains and doing it for the first 9 months, i was going to finish out the year...
i'm not judging you, i'm just telling you that it's not that hard to do and why not save some money while you're at it?</td>

<td>Three months is extremely too young, and being a preemie the babies bowels are not prepared to take on cereal. In my opinion you should wait until your baby turns 6 months truly. This could be when he/her is really 7 or 8 months depending on how early they were. But please consult your doctor be fore doing this, It could be very unsafe for your child. I know it seems as if they are always hungry but their stomach can not hold alot of contents at each feeding so they need to be feed more often.</td>

If she has and she is fine, then try not to worry too much. Don't take what it says in books too much to heart... fact is your baby hasn't read the book and isn't aware of what she is supposed to do... she only does what comes naturally.

So long as she is healthy, happy and growing at a good rate, then is not much wrong.  So then it comes down to your expectations of how it should be.  While it may be inconvenient, it is just something you have to bear with.  If you are able, seek help from family and friends to relieve the pressure on you.

I am sure it will sort itself out sooner rather than later.

<td>Does it reduce the odds of getting breast cancer when you breast feed and by how much?</td>
<td>Breastfeeding reduces the incidence of breast cancer in both mother and (female) baby.  It has been studied more for mothers than for daughters; the reduction is "dose-dependent"--the longer a woman nurses her babies (total months/years), the greater the reduction in her breast cancer risk.

According to some research, the risk of cancer drops about 1/3 of 1% for every month a mother nurses one (or more) of her children.  In other words, if you nurse for a total of 4 years, the risk drops 16% as a result of breastfeeding alone.  (Pregnancy also has a protective effect against breast cancer.)</td>

Being circumcised supposedly can reduce infections but if the penis is cleaned regularly there are no problems - a woman is more likely to get an infection and worse.  A lot of men have reported that getting circumcised later in life has reduced their sexual sensitivity and they wish they never had.  Being circumcised is likened to running around barefoot.  With time, you develop a tougher skin and a desensitivity.

Put them under the kid while changing or asleep at night (that third crib sheet change at 3am is not fun). I always loved having a couple 3 packs of onsies, at least 6 pairs of socks to keep feet warm, and the sack type gowns with a pull cord at the bottom (nice to keep the baby's legs covered, but easy night changes). A pack of thin receiving blankets just for added warmth if outside, and some cloth diapers- great birp cloths. If you plan to do a pacifier, buy a 3 pack (those things get lost alot). And look around your house to see if you have any brightly colored things to set in front of the baby to watch. When I did tummy time for my infant I tried to give her something to look at. Not that its something to play with, but they love bright colors. Otherwise, good luck and congratulations!!</td>

Congratulations on sticking with your convictions for so long. It's not easy! 

Children are not supposed to have honey for at least one year. Sometimes even longer depending on what your pediatrician says.

As far as chocolate, it's probably not a good idea to introduce chocolate into your daughter's diet. It contains small amounts of caffeine as well as sugar. Neither of which are good for a child. It is beneficial for you and your daughter if she doesn't get too used to having such treats. 

But I also have to say that if you strictly limit the amount she is getting to only one bite every once in a while (every few weeks or so) you probably wouldn't have any problems because of it. Be aware though, that she will now know what chocolate is and if she sees you with it she is going to want some! ;)

<td>what can u do for a baby with colic??</td>
<td>The swaying thing with baby's tummy on your forearm works like reparations for black folks.

Don't forget water. If you feed a bottle with 5 ounces, the newborn should have at least an ounce and a half of water with it. In the middle of the bottle, when you burp baby, give baby a bit of water after she burps, and after baby finishes bottle, give baby more water. Hydration is the key to a happy baby with little to no ear infections, trust me, my Trey just got over one.

P.S. If baby dont want water, try a teaspoon of sugar for every ounce of water, maybe less cuz shes 3 and a half months.</td>

<td>How can I tell if my son has food allergies?</td>
<td>Well my 3 year old has food allergies. He cannot have any nuts of any kind. But when he was an infant just to be safe all I gave him was formula until he was a year old. The doctor can do a skin test at a year old to see what your son is allergic to. Thats what they did for my son. It doesn't hurt your child at all. But just to be safe I would talk to your doctor about it and see if you or the father have any food allergies.</td>

<td>Can you breastfeed without complication after breast implants?</td>
<td>Pregnancy alone will change the appearance of your breasts! Breastfeeding may lead to additional changes, depending on a lot of factors (mostly genetic factors that you can't control).  Additionally, you may have difficulty producing a full milk supply depending on where the incisions are located (under the armpits or underneath the breast near the chest wall are least likely to cause complications; incisions around the areola and nipple most likely).  There is also scarring within the breast associated w/ the implants; this may also effect your ability to breastfeed.</td>

<td>Don't use a q tip like someone suggested. You don't want to be accidentally shoving something that like too far up and hurt your baby.

The best thing to do is to get a saline solution. There are saline solutions marketed for babies, but any saline solution will be just fine. Spray it, or use it as a drop, in your baby's nose. Wait about 3-5 minutes and any boogers will soften up. Plus it will loosen your baby's congestion. A few minutes later, you come back and use your nasal aspirator to suck up all the boogers. It'll work like a charm! This will especially be useful when your baby has a cold and have a hard time breathing in the middle of the night.</td>

I layed him oon the bed, and turned around to get a diaper out of his diaper bag. Before i new it, he had rolled himself all the way to the edge of the bed. When i turned around, i quickly tried to grab him, but he rolled himself right off the bed and flat onto his face. Boy, did he scream! I felt horrible, i started to cry too!

Does the doc have a 24 hour phone service for emergencies?  


Office Logistics 
Is the office conveniently located for less travel time with a sick child?  Does the practice have multiple offices you can visit? 
What are the office hours and are there any early morning or late evening hours for working parents?  
How long in advance must you book appointments?  
Are there any diagnostic facilities on site such as X-rays, blood work, etc.? 
What lab work can be performed at the pediatrician's office? 
Is there a specific time during the day that the doctor will take phone calls, and how does the office handle your phone in questions?   
Does the doctor answer any general questions by email?  
How does the office deal with after hours emergencies? 
Is there a 24 hour answering services that can connect you to a doctor?  
Who covers for the doctor when they are on vacation?  
Does the office mail out reminders for scheduled immunizations and checkups? 
 
Fees, Methods of Payment
 
How much are the fees for standard office visits?  
Are immunization shots extra, or are they included in the office visit charge?

Do they accept checks and credit cards? 
Is payment due at the time visit, or will the pediatrician bill you? 
What happens if you miss a scheduled visit?  Can you easily reschedule? 
  


Get a some good recommendations from friends or family.  Visit more than one.  It has to be a good match with a doc you feel comfortable with.  Do a background check on him as well

What you really want is a doc that will take time to talk to you.  I love it when my pediatrician tells me what I should look for in the next couple months and what my child should be doing right now.  Good luck Sorry so long.</td>

<td>My 4 month old baby is constipated, how can I help him?</td>
<td>There are several good options for a 4 month old.

Apple, pear, or prune juice works pretty well.  First try mixing it half and half with water, maybe 2 oz twice a day.  If that doesnt help, you can try it full strength.  It doesnt have to be "baby juice" - just make sure it is pasteurized.

Another solution is karo syrup and water (1-2 tsp per 4 oz water).  This can work also but to me it always seems like the nutritive value of this doesn't make a lot of sense.

Changing formulas rarely works, but can be tried.  It could also make things worse.  Rice cereal can constipate also, so limit how much the baby is taking of this (if any).

If the juice or karo/water doesnt work, then I would talk to the baby's doctor.</td>

<td>I am going to be adopting a baby.  I understand lactation can be induced.  How is that done?</td>
<td>Lactating for an adopted baby is easier if you've previously breastfed, but it can be done even if you haven't.  There are two points to work on here . . . producing milk, and getting the baby to latch on.  If you are doing an open adoption and can be in the hospital at the time of the baby's birth, try to work out a situation where you can breastfeed as soon as possible following delivery, so that you can simulate as much as possible the best course for any breastfeeding mom.  This should easy many of the latching problems with baby.  As to milk production . . . you should being pumping before the baby comes.  This will not necesarily result in much output (don't fear, many of us got little when we pumped after giving birth!), but the goal is to give your body the idea that it needs to make milk.  In reality, the pump will never be as good as the baby, but you need all the help you can get.  See resource below for lots more info.  Also, prepare yourself for the idea that you may never have a full supply . . . this is common and NOT a failure.  You are doing an amazing thing by giving this baby any breastmilk.</td>

<td>Can I add single grain rice cereal to my four week old babies milk?</td>

I can not give you advice on what to feed your baby (when he/she is older) but I will tell you of my experience. I have given rice cereal to all 3 of my babies (usually about 2-2.5mos), but all for different reasons. One had reflux and I was told by my Ped. to give her the rice cereal. One was, literally, eating us out of house and home and again, I was advised to give rice cereal. My latest baby, I gave it to her because she had her days and night mixed up and try as I might and after following all suggestions, I opted to try giving her some. At first she ate it off the spoon, but then she wanted more and more and more...so I mix a TBSP or so with her formula, in the evening and it works. :) She is content, sleeps all night, and she enjoys the cereal. 

I have noticed that a lot of women have done this but won't admit it..because it's like a societal no-no but you have to go with your instinct. I've yet to hear a bad story about a child who ate cereal early on.
Good luck.

<td>what is to high for a baby's temperature?</td>
<td>According to my son's pediatrician, fever and change in behavior are the best measure of whether you should call the doctor or not. A low fever may be ok, but if your daughter is considerably lethargic or just not behaving like usual, then it's time to call the doctor. It also goes the same for a slight fever, but acting like there's nothing wrong.

Here is what Dr. Sears say about fevers:

WHEN TO PAGE YOUR DOCTOR

Remember, fevers are your body's natural response to infection, and not necessarily a sign that something serious is taking place. 

--Low-grade fevers are generally not serious, are easily treated, and can wait until the morning to be evaluated by your doctor. 

--Fevers of 101 to 103 (38.4 to 39.5 Celcius) are also generally not serious and can wait until morning to be evaluated, except as indicated below. 

--High fevers of 104 (40 Celcius) or higher that quickly come down to 100 or 101 (37.8 to 38.3 Celcius) with the treatment measures below are also generally not serious and can wait until morning, except as indicated below. 

So for now, don’t rush to page your doctor. Read through this section, and call your doctor during office hours, or page your doctor according to the following guidelines: 

Here are the situations that usually warrant an urgent call to your doctor. If none of these fit your current situation, then you probably don’t need to page your doctor. Follow our treatment advice below and call your doctor during office hours. 

If your infant is 6 weeks or younger, and has a fever of 101 or higher, this is considered a medical emergency. Your doctor should evaluate your infant right away, either during business hours, or in an emergency room after hours. Do not give any fever-reducing medications in this situation (you don't want to hide the fever until after a doctor has evaluated your baby). Be sure to confirm any fevers with a rectal thermometer (if available) before contacting your doctor. 

Infants age 7 weeks to three months with a fever over 101 warrant an appointment with your doctor within the next several hours. You generally don’t need to page your doctor in the middle of the night in this situation if the office opens within the next few hours. Simply follow our recommendations on treating fever below and call your doctor in the morning. If it is the early evening you should probably page your doctor, since the office won’t be open until the following day. Be sure to confirm any fevers with a rectal thermometer (if available) before contacting your doctor. 

If your child of any age has one or more of the following symptoms, you should probably call your doctor right away: 

High fevers of 104 (40 Celcius) or higher that don't come down to 101 or 102 (38.3 to 38.9 Celcius) with the treatment measures below. 

-Lethargy – this means more than your child just isn't acting right or laying quietly in your arms. Lethargy actually refers to your child being limp, lifeless, unresponsive, or won't make eye contact. 

-Irritability - this means more than just fussiness. A truly irritable child will cry for hours with minimal verbal interaction, and is almost impossible to console. 

-Meningitis – symptoms are high fever, stiff neck or pain in 
the back of the neck, vomiting, headache, bright light hurts the eyes. Before paging your doctor, you should also look up any other symptoms your child has, such as cough, vomiting, rash, etc and read those guidelines to determine your best course of action.</td>

<td>Did small-town hospitals in the 50's have obstetric units?</td>
<td>This practice began in the 30s and 40s, when childbirth was turned into a "medical procedure" rather than a natural event, with more and more births - and ultimately, MOST of them - taking place in hospitals. New mothers were stripped of their ability to participate in their own births, often drugged so heavily that they couldn't push, or didn't even remember the birth itself. Because the mother couldn't care for her newborn following its birth, hospital nurseries (with thos horrid glass windows) were created, and babies were taken straight there - and cared for there for the majority of their hospital stay.

Thankfully, more and more hospitals are now transforming their birth centers into a more home-like environment with rooming-in for mother and baby, which is invaluable both for bonding and for allowing the mother to learn to care for her baby before being released to go home.</td>

<td>My baby seems to only like the milk in the beginning without the fat. Could she have a problem with the fat?</td>
<td>It is possible that she has inherited her fathers problems with lactose and fat. However, if she is still very young she may be tiring out before getting to the good stuff and need to rest up before carrying on. Let her have a couple of minutes than nudge her with your nipple or stroke her cheek with your fore finger, to get her going again. Do what you can to keep her awake enough to continue nursing. She must get that back milk in order to really thrive. Stroke your breasts as well to keep the milk flowing more quickly. Some babies can be a little lazy! They prefer the faster flow at the beginning. If she has problems with it afterwards, like spitting up a lot or outright vomiting, take her to your doctor. He may want to put her on a different formula. Good luck with your little one and congratulations.</td>

<td>Ferber method : Does it work?</td>
<td>I have a 9 month old daughter who went through (what sounds to be) the same thing at 8 months.  She finally started sleeping "through the night" after a very long journey and then night wakings started every few hours or so.  I am not a fan of any cry-it-out methods so I parented her the whole way through.  It turned out she had an ear infection.  Then, when it started again a few weeks later, she was getting 2 teeth.  Please also keep in mind, between 8 - 10 months old infants start learning "object permanence", meaning your son knows you exist even after you leave the room.  Because of this, sometimes night waking occurs due to separation anxiety.  Remember, just when you think you've figured them out, they change their routine.  Just make sure you rule out any medical reasons for the wakings before you decide to try any "ferber" methods.</td>

I urge you to warm a baby bottle in a warm pan of water on the stove and check it for temp on the inside of your wrist where it is most tender to check for a dangerous temp level.. You are wise to check on this.. what a lucky baby.. :) also just to let you know.. please check the elasticity of the baby nipples each time you use.. they can become dried out and unsafe after many uses.. especially if you wash them in the dishwasher..

You'll be too tired to enjoy a vacation. When the baby gets into a more regular pattern, travel is somewhat easier. When the baby begins to hold up his/her head and enjoys riding in a stroller or a backpack carrier, you can enjoy outings. If you're breastfeeding, you don't need to carry a lot of bottles but it's sometimes challenging to find a comfortable spot to feed the baby. And you do have to carry tons of other stuff like diapers and clothing changes.  I'd start with day trips before trying a full fledged vacation.</td>

I would avoid icecream with any of the common allergic foods, such as peanuts (or any nuts), strawberries, etc.  In general we recommend steering clear of eggs, but very little egg (if any) is in most icecream.

Of course, its not something I would feed him or her frequently.  And if you are worried about the cow's milk, don't be.  We don't want kids switching to ALL cow's milk until around a year of age, but a little every now and then won't hurt them!</td>

<td>Starting solids seems like rocket science but it's really not. I would wait until at least four months, if he is no longer satisfied with milk then start offering him rice cereal. Make sure you only give him rice cereal for at least a week(as well as his milk of course). Then start giving him banannas or whatever. Offer him only banannas and rice cereal (and milk) for a week. Do this each time you introduce a new food. This is to make sure he is not allergic.  If he breaks out in a rash you will know exactly what has caused this rash and eliminate it etc...  Also knowing when to gap the feedings is also tricky. I'm a stickler for schedules. Here is a sample schedule that my daughter followed as a baby. 
8am:Wake up Milk feed
9am:breakfast (solids)
10am: Bottle feed
11am: Snack (crackers or cheerios)
12pm: Bottle feed
1pm: Lunch (solids)
2pm: Bottle feed
3pm: Snack
4pm: Bottle feed
5pm: Dinner(solids)
6pm: Bottle feed
6:30: Bath and bed

My daughter was early to bed. Also I only gave her 4oz of formula at each bottle feeding. This was all plenty for her. Healthy and happy as can be. Good luck I know this can all seem overwhelming. I also made my own baby food. Soooo much cheaper and healthier. And it only took about an hour every couple of months. I would recommend Super Baby Food (book). It was awesome. Tells you what age is appropriate to introduce certain foods. Like no tomatoes until a year.  Also tells you how to make the baby food. My daughter was on solely table foods by 10 months old. She could chew and swallow and feed herself and I think it was all because she had homemade baby food. No added sugar and salts and crap. All natural goodness. Good luck</td>

<td>Is it really bad to have your chld watch TV or Videos if it is very limited, controlled &amp; you watch with them?</td>
<td>Well, first of all let me say that I think that children should never watch TV. I am vehemently against it. It closes the lines of communication and has replaced conversation.

After having said that, let me also say that what you do with your daughter and the limited exposure to TV that you have provided her with and the fact that you always watch it with her is so amazing! I have never known a parent (and I have known many) who have not used TV as a babysitter. 

The fact that you talk to her about what you are watching and you stay with her while she is watching just warms my heart. 

You have obviously given your daughter a warm and responsive environment to grow and develop in and I wish you continued success and loving times with her. 

(One warning about Toy Story. Children LOVE it, but be careful regarding the language in that movie. I had a problem with a little girl I nannied for because she didn't realize it was bad to call people "stupid" and "idiot" which are words frequently used in the movie.)</td>

It is the same thing as when we are hungry, sometimes we want a snack, sometimes we want a buffet; just depends on how hungry we are. 

The books actually say that as a recommendation for a newborns minimum diet, not as a strict guideline. Just remember to keep YOUR diet healthy to keep your supply full of nutrients for your son. Take care and good luck!</td>

<td>is there any danger for a baby to get dog's parasites or illnesses ?</td>
<td>Hi there - make sure your dog is wormed regularly in accordance with the worm medication instructions - usually every month.  

Obviously you should clear up any waste matter from your dog outside where your baby might play. It might be an idea to fence off a little of the garden exclusively for your dog to do his business - It took about a month to train my dog that is the place to "go" now. Dog's faeces can carry lots of bacteria as well as cats faeces too - the most dangerous is toxoplasmosis which can cause permanent blindness. 

There is a risk from flea bites to not only babies but also adults, so protect your dog from fleas - here in the UK, I found that Frontline is the best (a little costly though). 

My little one climbs all over my dog - but I'm happy knowing that my dog is clean, de-flea'd and wormed regularly. 

Try not to let your dog lick your babies face or pick up any of baby's toys, soothers, bottles etc. 

Good luck!</td>

<td>Let the baby sleep in the crib on his back to avoid Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. He is more likely to suffer from the danger of suffocation sleeping with an adult.

Let the poor dad come back to his bed. You want your boy to be able to sleep in his bed when he is 3 yrs old, right? Then train him now. If you wait until 2 or 3, he is likely to stay in your bed when he is 5.

If he wakes up at night, just give him some water to keep him from dehydration. Change the diaper, then put him to crib again. He may cry for a few minutes, then go to sleep. Some parents feed the baby a whole meal when they get up at night. If you do that, the baby will be used to getting up for that extra meal for a long time(a friend of mine had a boy who woke up every night for some milk until 3! And she lets him!) Having water for a few times will help his body know that it's not meal time in the middle of the night.

Anyways, don't let the baby come before your spouse. Maintaining a healthy marriage relationship is the greatest gift for the child. And better sleep for parents will give the baby healthier and happier parents. These all benefit the baby.</td>

Babies typically need one more light layer of clothing than their Mamas to feel comfortable.  My son always had cold feet, and would cry if he didn't have socks on!  Some babies feel better when swaddled in a receiving blanket.  She could be a baby who needs to eat more often, my son was still nursing every hour at 2 months.  Or she could be eating too much, make sure she gets the air out by burping frequently.  If she's gassy, give her relief with gas medicine, equate works as well as mylicon.  Make sure Mama knows babies at this age cry a lot because their lungs are growing, and they have no other way to communicate anyway.  Oh, some babies cry when over stimulated (new babies always get held a lot ;-) )  If that's the case take baby into a quiet room, hold her if she wants to be held and let her cry it out.

<td>Is Lela growing appropriately? Explain!?</td>
<td>48oz of formula per day for a 3 month old!  That's a TON!!!!!!  Most babies that age take 25-30oz/day.  This child is definitely being overfed.  This can lead to obesity and frequent spitting-up.  The baby's stomach is only so big!  Also, just because the baby is crying doesn't mean that she is hungry.

Also, solid food is inappropriate at this age.  Most pediatricians reccomend only rice cereal @ 4 months, then baby foods @ 6 months.  Start with veggies, then meats/dinners, then fruits.  The reason behind the timing is an increased risk of food allergies in babies who get solids too soon.  For 0-4months ONLY formula - no solids/cereal, no extra water.</td>

<td>It is very normal fo rthe shape of a newborns head to be 'odd'. The skull of a newborn doesnt fully interlock until about the age of 2, making the newborns skull soft and able to shape-shift.

A baby born vaginally is more likely to start off with and odd shaped head, because of the pressure on the head during delivery. The newborn's head will usually round back out around 2 months of age.

A baby born by c-section usually has a well rounded head, because it doesnt have the pressure from a vaginal birth. 

Thanks to the new reasearch about putting our babies on their backs to sleep to help avoid SIDS, many newborns are getting a flattening of the backs of their heads. This is completly normal, as long as it doesnt persist past the first year. To help with the mishapen head, make sure your baby gets plenty of tummy time, to releive pressure put on the back of the head. Some babies prefer to have their heads turn either right or left while on ther backs, so sometimes only one side of the back of their head becomes flattened. 

Once a baby can sit up on their own ( about 5-8 months), the head will round back out. Usually, if the head becomes severely mishaped passed the 10th month, a doctor might have the child wear a special helmet to help reshape the skull.</td>

We have a 6 month old baby boy, and i have been staying home since i was 3 months pregnant with him because of pregnancy complications. I totally understand the feeling of needing attention, and when our husbands get home, they are tired.

Its hard, because our babies cant really do anythign with us yet. Honestly, what i do to pass the time is:

-Get online, like you are know., That helps pass a few hours at least.

-Go to the local health department in your town, and ask about parenting groups and such. I just joined a exercise class where you bring your baby, and its really fun. 

-Child care can be expensive, and half your paycheck goes to it. But maybe you can try and find a job that works sround your husbands job, at least part-time or until you can afford child care.

I dont really know anyother things to help. I usually just clean all day, go for walks, and try and meet people while im out walknig with the baby...lol.

Good luck!</td>

<td>Is anything here lacking the desire to be intimate with your partner?</td>
<td>He does not understand the basic concept of romance.  Think of it like two walls.  He is the wall with one switch--on and off.  You flip the switch, and he wants sex.  Women, on the other hand, would look like a wall with tons of switches, knobs, and dials, and it takes the right combination to get the "switch" turned on.  If he wants it more often, you need to teach him where your "buttons" are.  What makes you want to feel intimate.  You are both young, and will be together a loooong time.  You need to start working these things out now.  Look up "Focus on the Family" by James Dobson.  He has a Christian website, and he gives sound advice, even on romance and sex.  You guys can work this out--it just takes work to make a marriage work.  Also, you can learn how to do "quickie" things for him just to satisfy his loins without you having to feel like you are being violated.  The most important thing is COMMUNICATION!</td>

<td>How many days does it take to dry out breastmilk?? What do you do to deal with the pain??</td>
<td>Breastfeeding is a awsome thing not only for health reason but allows the mother to bond with the baby. It is really hard to dry out but i must say once  yo start there is no turning back . Try not to stimulate your breast . The hot showers arent so well all that does is allows for more milk because it expands the glands . Pumping isnt well either it allows for more milk as well . The best thing to do is cut your child down to feeding only 2 times a day then use a bottle there after . Once in the am and once in the pm . for about a week or more then from there cut it back to once a day  then the next week stop .  Once you stop make sure you stil cuddle the baby as you did while feeding but only now it is with the bottle . This works . As far as pain wear a tight sports bar and place ice for swelling .If crusting happenes the allow cool water compress to remove and keep aloe on the nipples for scabbing can be bad . I must also say this ( sex ) can make your breast milk  come more as well maybe I know this is crazy for some people but for the week of dry out no sex ! Try to refrain from thougts such as sex arousial can make dropping milk more . I hope this helps out .</td>

<td>when do neuron creation cease?</td>
<td>Well, as we are born there are many neurons that have already been created. But these neurons deteriorate overtime when not used for a very long time.  As long as they get used once in a while, they stay 'alive'. So we don't make neurons as we grow old, we just try to keep the ones we already have after we've stopped growing. That's why it's very important to keep our minds active to keep neurons firing and to keep them from dying.   As we grow older and forget more and more things, neurons connected to a particular part of the brain (particular memory) slowly die.</td>

Both of my sons could sit up without support by 5 months, where as all three of my friend's babies couldn't sit without support until 6 and 7 months. If your baby can't sit up without support by his 9 month well-baby check up, you should let your doctor know, especially if it's a concern for you. Your doctor can help determine if there's anything you can do to encourage your baby or if there may be a developmental delay that needs to be looked into. As for right now... don't worry about it, your baby is most likely going to sit up on their own when he/she is ready to!</td>

<td>Do you need additional information to accurately assess Shana's nutrient intake?</td>
<td>From 6-12 months, babies should consume 24-30oz of standard formula per day (enfamil, similac, etc.).  You can break that up into 3-4 bottles/day. They usually don't need additional water or juice, and it should actually be avoided in younger babies.  Excessive water intake in young infants (&lt; 6 months) can cause low sodium levels in the blood, which can lead to seizures.

Once babies turn one year of age, formula is no longer needed.  Most pediatricians advise giving 12-16oz of whole milk per day with the rest of fluids being water.  Juice is okay, but don't give too much - it can cause a watery diarrhea (called toddler's diarrhea).  The details you give in solid food sound great.

These are just general guidelines.  The literature and other sources have varying opinions, and you may get other opinions in this forum.  However, these guidelines are followed by most pediatricians.</td>

The top twists off so you can put food into the mesh, and the top is big enough that it won't fit into baby's mouth (although they should still be supervised when using the feeder.) Baby chews on the mesh, and tiny bits of food come through for them to eat, and hard or cold foods in the feeder would certainly help with teething.

However, by the time I bought one, my six-month-old daughter already knew that food was eaten off of a spoon, and she wasn't about to put that mesh bag in her mouth and chew on it. It's just as well - everyone I know that's used them have said that it makes a horrific mess and really isn't worth the hassle. Traditional teethers work just as well (maybe better) for that purpose, and most any food can be chopped finely enough for baby to try without the use of the mesh bag.</td>

We've tried going back on solids but she's having none of it. I'm not worried at all. We keep offering food to her &amp; she will tell us when she's ready by eating it. I'm not going to force the food into her mouth.

My cousin's baby is 7 months old and not interested in solids at all.
I have to say though that at 11 months they should be showing an interest. How about starting with some finger foods instead? Our girl LOVES that. Her fave at the moment is grated cheese.

<td>Breast Feeding Vs. Bottle?</td>
<td>I personally go for the bottle. Yes, its true that breastfeeding is the most nautral way, and probablly the most healthiest, but i dont feel comfprtable doing it. WWith bottle feeding, i can premake formula, and have babysitters be able to feed the baby. Also, my husband can help out and bottle feed the baby while i get some sleep. With breastfeeding ( i tried this with my first), you always have to worry about what you eat, drink, and medications you take that can affect the breastmilk. And breast leaks, especially in public, are embarrassing. 

There are pro's and con's for both. But its really what the person feel smore comfortable doing. Bottle feeding may be more expensive, but its easier for me, and it helps invlove my husband in the feeding.</td>

They can be anywhere from an hour to 3 hours, but I usually make sure he's up a few hours before bedtime.  but it depends on whether or not your baby sleeps through the whole night or not.  i'd say if your 8 month old doesn't sleep through the night to give maybe 3 naps.</td>

If your baby is very hungry and you're not up to speed yet,use a breast pump in between feeds, but not too close to when your baby's next feed is due or you may diminish your store. Be careful not to cause an over supply though as your breasts can become engorged which can be very painful.</td>

<td>Does reverse pshycology(hope i spelled that rite)work?</td>
<td>Even parents who don't effectively use other parenting techniques, like time-out, using natural and logical consequences, distraction or extinction, likely know about reverse psychology. 
Using this technique, to get your kids to finish their dinner, you might say something like:

"I bet you can't eat all of those peas in 30 seconds." 
or when trying to get him to put away a toy, you might say:

"I'll put it away for you. You probably don't know how to fit it all back in the box anyway." 
So you are essentially trying to get your child to do the exact opposite of what you really want him to do. 

This should not be confused with trying to make chores fun. If you say 'let's see who can put more toys away in 5 minutes,' then that isn't reverse psychology, since you are actually telling him to do what you what him to do.

It also can work to 'encourage' your child to not do something that they really want to do. For example, you might try to scare your child into not crossing the street by saying:

"OK. Go ahead and cross the street by yourself. You'll just get hit by a car..." 
Does Reverse Psychology Work
Parents who use reverse psychology as a discipline technique recognize that it can work. But is it good parenting?

If your child is getting bad grades, is it really a good idea to say:

"That's okay. You're probably not smart enough to make better grades anyway"? 
Some kids might study more after being told that by a parent, but many others will simply think that they aren't smart and should stop trying to make better grades.

When using reverse psychology, if you consider that you are more 'manipulating' your child than anything else, then all of a sudden it takes on a more negative tone and doesn't seem like good parenting. After all, discipline is supposed to be about teaching, isn't it?

Also, reverse psychology doesn't always work. And when it does, a more traditional discipline technique would likely have worked just as well.

Using Reverse Psychology
If you do use reverse psychology, don't use it often. And don't use it in a way that might hurt your child's self-esteem or make him feel guilty.

For example, if your toddler or preschooler doesn't want to take a bath in the evening, you might say 'okay, let's just go straight to bed then.' That will probably work, because most younger kids would rather do almost anything than go to bed early. 

Or if she doesn't want to sit in her car seat, you might say 'fine, then we just won't go to the zoo.'

Why are these examples more appropriate then the ones mentioned above? While you are still trying to get your child to do something that they don't want to do, you are offering them choices instead of simply trying to manipulate them in a negative way to do something.

Using pure reverse psychology, for the kids not wanting to take a bath, a parent would probably say:

"OK, don't take a bath. Then you will smell bad and no one will like you" or "you will get sick from the germs on your body and have to go to the emergency room" 
So go ahead and use reverse psychology, as long as you don't mind paying for years of therapy later on to boost your child's self-esteem and fix any damage you do...</td>

What Will happen is that your baby will probably refuse the bottle for a couple of days or less after which he will understand that he has no choice.

Just make sure you get the bottles out of sight, if possible out of the house as eighteen months is pretty old and he will be kind of aware of his surrounding.

There are many things you can do to relieve his pain. Give him a teether ring that you is frozen or maybe even get some Anbesol at your local drug store.

<td>Is it good or bad if babies sleep in their parents' bed?</td>
<td>It's very good for the baby.  Babies are still learning how to live out in the world.  They sometimes forget to breathe.  Sleeping next to your baby can lower the risk of SIDS for this reason.  In addition, most infants need frequent breastfeedings for several weeks or months.  Sleeping next to the mother makes it more likely that she will hear the first feeding cues (it's hard to hear a baby wake up from more than a couple of feet away!).

In addition, because the mother doesn't have to get out of bed to nurse the baby, *she* can get more sleep.  Most mothers who sleep with their babies learn over time to nurse without fully waking up.  Plus, when baby is sleeping next to the mother, they sleep "in sync"--the baby wakes up when the mother is in a lighter sleep stage, so she isn't losing all her deep sleep as can happen when baby is somewhere else.

Lastly, mammals weren't designed (whether by evolution or God) to sleep alone.  Most *adults* don't like to sleep alone, let alone a baby who doesn't understand concepts like time.

Just like there are rules for safe crib sleeping (be sure that cribs aren't painted with lead paint, that the slats are close enough together, that the mattress fits tightly), there are rules for safe sleeping in the parents' bed.  Adults who are drunk, under the influence of drugs, or otherwise in a condition that lowers consciousness of their environment should not co-sleep with their babies.  Babies should not have any soft bedding near their faces.  The sleeping surface should be firm.  For more information, please see the sources section below.

Do you roll out of bed at night?  If you do, it may not be safe to sleep with your baby.  If not, think about it--if you *did* roll out of bed, the worst you could do would be break a leg.  If you're aware enough of your surroundings even while asleep to not risk a broken leg, you certainly wouldn't risk hurting your own child!

If you do choose to co-sleep, the easiest thing to do is to continue until the child is ready to move out.  This is likely to be at least a year and possibly longer.  The child *will* want to move out; I can promise you that you won't have a 25 year old who can't get married because she/he will miss you at night!

Luckily, babies and young children can be very deep sleepers.  You'll notice that families that co-sleep *do* have further children, so obviously this is not the end to your sex life!  You can choose to be intimate in places other than your bed, or you can wait until the young child is fast asleep.</td>

hopefully you'll have someone there to help you, get rest whenever you can...like i said above, change your baby's diapers every couple of hrs or so (don't wake baby up for it...just after you've feed it), don't worry about putting your baby on a feeding routine...trust me, let it sleep as long at it wants and it will let you know when it's hungry...put lots of lotion on b/c their sking tends to get dry a lot...hold it as much as possible...it needs lots of human contact...have a time during the day where it lies naked (well, with diaper still on of course) on your naked (with bra on if you wish) chest...skin to skin contact is necessary with both parents to help the bonding and feeling secure and safe and loved...

<td>Can breastmilk be refridgerated and/or reheated after it's been heated once?</td>
<td>Here's an article I found for you:

Breastmilk Storage Guidelines:

Storing milk in 2-4 ounce amounts may reduce waste. Refrigerated milk has more anti-infective properties than frozen milk. Cool milk in refrigerator before adding to frozen milk.

Human milk can be stored

    * at room temperature (66-72°F, 19-22°C) for up to 10 hours
    * in a refrigerator (32-39°F, 0-4°C) for up to 8 days
    * in a freezer compartment inside a refrigerator (variable temperature due to the door opening frequently) for up to 2 weeks
    * in a freezer compartment with a separate door (variable temperature due to the door opening frequently) for up to 3 to 4 months.
    * in a separate deep freeze (0°F, -19°C) for up to 6 months or longer.

What Type of Container to Use

Refrigerated or frozen milk may be stored in:

    * hard-sided plastic or glass containers with well-fitting tops
    * freezer milk bags that are designed for storing human milk

Disposable bottle liners are not recommended.

How to Warm the Milk

Thaw and/or heat under warm, running water.

Do not bring temperature of milk to boiling point.

Gently swirl milk before testing the temperature. Swirling will also redistribute the cream into the milk. (It is normal for stored milk to separate into a cream and milk layer.)

Do not use a microwave oven to heat human milk.

Thawed Milk

If milk has been frozen and thawed, it can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours for later use. It should not be refrozen. It is not known whether milk that is left in the bottle after a feeding can be safely kept until the next feeding or if it should be discarded.

According to THE BREASTFEEDING ANSWER BOOK, page 228, research indicates that human milk has previously unrecognized properties that protect it from bacterial contamination. One study, Barger and Bull 1987, found that there was no statistically significant difference between the bacterial levels of milk stored for 10 hours at room temperature and milk that had been refrigerated for 10 hours. Another study, Pardou 1994, found that after 8 days of refrigeration some of the milk actually had lower bacterial levels than it did on the day it was expressed.

Expressed milk can be kept in a common refrigerator at the workplace or in a day care center. The US Centers for Disease Control and the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration agree that human milk is not among the body fluids that require special handling or storage in a separate container.</td>

<td>How old do babies need to be to fly ?</td>
<td>My pediatrician told me that it is recommended that babies be somewhere around  6 weeks old.  I flew with mine when he was 5 weeks old.  Thier ears are so sensitive and they don't have the ablility to pop their ears.   Gove them something to suck on when you fly, like a pacifier or a bottle of juice, milk or water if they get uncomfortable.  If you breastfeed, it's a good time to do it when they fly because the sucking and swallowing helps thier ears pop.</td>

<td>Is my 5-month old eating enough and ready for solids (cereal)?</td>
<td>Yeah, you can definitely introduce cereals now. She sounds like she is on the right track to a healthy lifestyle already. :) If you want to get her used to the taste a lil bit, you can add a lil bit of cereal to her formula in the bottle, or you can just try using a spoon. Remember to be patient though, they have no idea what a spoon is at that age, nor do they understand solids. So just go slow, and let her get used to the idea of a spoon. It only took my son a couple days to a week to figure out that it was acutally food on the spoon. Then after she gets used to the spoon, you can try the baby fruits. They love that stuff. Just watch for allergies. Some babies have allergies to certain foods, but usually they out-grow them. Hope this helps. You can also check the below website for advice and tips. And they have an option for them to call you by entering your phone number. Just go to the "contact us" option on the page, and then the "click to talk to us" option. It is very nice and helpful, and then they send you coupons too. hehe I have done that several times. Good luck. :)</td>

<td>why do young ladys want to just threow away there babies??</td>
<td>because society shuns young unmarried women with babies. Perhaps they fear being caught dropping off the baby at the fire station or hospital.. perhaps their mother or father ( or both) beats them and don't want to do anything to make their life worse. 

true though, it dosn't take much to drop a baby off at the fire or police station.. or even and someones' door stepp. rather than in the trash.</td>

1/ Wrap him up in a blanket lay him on his side and surround him with pillows, so its all safe and snug, put a pillow at the end of his feet, and on his sides, NOT near the face.
2/ my fave one is getting an extra sheet, folded in half, lay it width way under the matteress, so the ends can be wrapped around baby, another way ofr making him feel secure, AGAIN NOT near his face
thats all my advice, try and make his cot/crib as secure and safe for him as possible, he is leaving the comfort of his bassinet something HE knows to a new world...........</td>

<td>My 4 month old started spitting up more often all of a sudden. Any ideas as to why?</td>
<td>My 5 month old son also has a problem with spitting up, especially lately. 

-Dont force your baby to fininsh his meals if he doesnt want to. A baby knows when they are full, and encouraging to eat more will only overfill him, thus leading to spitting up.

-After eatting, keep your baby upright for at least 30 minutes to help aid in digestion.

-Burping is always a good idea. For my son, we had an x0ray to see why he was spitting up so much, and it was gas. Even if a baby burps, he can still have gas trappe din his belly. We use Mylicon Baby Gas Drops. They are safe to use before each feeding, and break down all the extra gas that they baby cant get out through burping. Our son has stopping spitting up by about %80. 

-Your baby may have Acid Reflux, which is actually quite normal in babies. Talk to your baby's doctor about gettinf tested for this.

-Make sure that the bottles/cups you use for your baby are properly cleaned before using them. Using dirty items can grow bacteria in them, causing your baby to get a stomach bug, and thus spit up more.

Good luck!</td>

<td>I think my wife has a hormone imbalance since having our second child. Mean, irritable, and rude. what to do?</td>
<td>Talk to your wife! If you are buddies, it'll be ok. You may find that it's not a hormone imbalance that's making her irratable...you'll find out if you talk it out. Why not take her out to dinner? Find a baby sitter, and have a nice outing together just the two of you. Bring up the subject. Let her know that you understand how it's been hard for her, but ask that maybe you could be a little less irratable with you because you need a buddy once in a while. Ask her why she is being more irritable and rude lately, and if there's any way you could help to alleviate some of the stress. 

When you are nice and tentative to your wife, she'll likely to return the favor. So go take her out to dinner and relieve some of her stress. She may just be wanting/NEEDING a break to recharge.</td>

At this age babies do not understand that things are still there or around when they can not see them .  Sometimes if you keep talking to her while you are out of site it will calm her down because she knows that you are there by hearing your voice.  There is no such thing as spoiling your baby.

You may want to consider letting the baby nurse, or take a bottle or pacifier during the ascent and descent, as sucking and swallowing may assist with the equalization of pressure in the ears.

If your baby has any medical problems, particularly heart or lung problems you would obviously want to discuss it with the baby's doctor first!

It is not uncommon for this to happen.  I am sure that if it is serious you will need to get him medicated.  But give his system a chance to clear out first.  What goes in must come out.  If you stop putting in the wrong stuff he will "dry up".  The brat diet will work.  Stop with fruit juices too for a while.  

Of course if many days go by and he is getting dehydrated, then you need to go back or go get a second opinion somewhere.  Do not be afraid to go back to the doctor, better safe than sorry.</td>

<td>When do children start teehing?</td>
<td>Teething doesn't normally happen as early as 3 1/2 months, but every child develops at their own pace and teething times are very varied and individual for each child so I would not be suprised if it is starting early. Chewing a lot is one sign of teething, so is crankyness but these can also be present before teething starts. Babies are very oral and explore everything with their mouths, so she could just be exploring and enjoying the feeling of chewing on things.
I thought this website had some good and accurate nfo so have a look at some of the other symptoms to look out for as well as some ways to help her through this tough time. Good luck!

Much of it depends on the child though.  Some children only need a strong verbal reproach to change their behavior.  You can always try to redirect their attention, but I've never had much luck with this one.  After age one, time out can be used following the rule of one minute of time out for every year of age.  Children today are COMPLETELY out of control and it's time parents started being responsible for their kids' behavior.</td>
